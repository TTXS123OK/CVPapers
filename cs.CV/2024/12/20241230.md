- **Summary**: Recently, "visual o1" began to enter people's vision, with expectations that this slow-thinking design can solve visual reasoning tasks, especially geometric math problems. However, the reality is that current LVLMs (Large Vision Language Models) can hardly even accurately copy a geometric figure, let alone truly understand the complex inherent logic and spatial relationships within geometric shapes. We believe accurate copying (strong perception) is the first step to visual o1. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of "slow perception" (SP), which guides the model to gradually perceive basic point-line combinations, as our humans, reconstruct complex geometric structures progressively. There are two-fold stages in SP: a) perception decomposition. Perception is not instantaneous. In this stage, complex geometric figures are broken down into basic simple units to unify geometry representation. b) perception flow, which acknowledges that accurately tracing a line is not an easy task. This stage aims to avoid "long visual jumps" in regressing line segments by using a proposed "perceptual ruler" to trace each line stroke-by-stroke. Surprisingly, such a human-like perception manner enjoys an inference time scaling law -- the slower, the better. Researchers strive to speed up the model's perception in the past, but we slow it down again, allowing the model to read the image step-by-step and carefully.

- **Summary**: Traditional object detection models are constrained by the limitations of closed-set datasets, detecting only categories encountered during training. While multimodal models have extended category recognition by aligning text and image modalities, they introduce significant inference overhead due to cross-modality fusion and still remain restricted by predefined vocabulary, leaving them ineffective at handling unknown objects in open-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce Universal Open-World Object Detection (Uni-OWD), a new paradigm that unifies open-vocabulary and open-world object detection tasks. To address the challenges of this setting, we propose YOLO-UniOW, a novel model that advances the boundaries of efficiency, versatility, and performance. YOLO-UniOW incorporates Adaptive Decision Learning to replace computationally expensive cross-modality fusion with lightweight alignment in the CLIP latent space, achieving efficient detection without compromising generalization. Additionally, we design a Wildcard Learning strategy that detects out-of-distribution objects as "unknown" while enabling dynamic vocabulary expansion without the need for incremental learning. This design empowers YOLO-UniOW to seamlessly adapt to new categories in open-world environments. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of YOLO-UniOW, achieving achieving 34.6 AP and 30.0 APr on LVIS with an inference speed of 69.6 FPS. The model also sets benchmarks on M-OWODB, S-OWODB, and nuScenes datasets, showcasing its unmatched performance in open-world object detection.

- **Summary**: Text-based person search aims to retrieve the matched pedestrians from a large-scale image database according to the text description. The core difficulty of this task is how to extract effective details from pedestrian images and texts, and achieve cross-modal alignment in a common latent space. Prior works adopt image and text encoders pre-trained on unimodal data to extract global and local features from image and text respectively, and then global-local alignment is achieved explicitly. However, these approaches still lack the ability of understanding visual details, and the retrieval accuracy is still limited by identity confusion. In order to alleviate the above problems, we rethink the importance of visual features for text-based person search, and propose VFE-TPS, a Visual Feature Enhanced Text-based Person Search model. It introduces a pre-trained multimodal backbone CLIP to learn basic multimodal features and constructs Text Guided Masked Image Modeling task to enhance the model's ability of learning local visual details without explicit annotation. In addition, we design Identity Supervised Global Visual Feature Calibration task to guide the model learn identity-aware global visual features. The key finding of our study is that, with the help of our proposed auxiliary tasks, the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained CLIP model can be successfully adapted to text-based person search task, and the model's visual understanding ability is significantly enhanced. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed model exceeds the existing approaches, and the Rank-1 accuracy is significantly improved with a notable margin of about $1\%\sim9\%$.

- **Summary**: Scaling by training on large datasets has been shown to enhance the quality and fidelity of image generation and manipulation with diffusion models; however, such large datasets are not always accessible in medical imaging due to cost and privacy issues, which contradicts one of the main applications of such models to produce synthetic samples where real data is scarce. Also, finetuning on pre-trained general models has been a challenge due to the distribution shift between the medical domain and the pre-trained models. Here, we propose Latent Drift (LD) for diffusion models that can be adopted for any fine-tuning method to mitigate the issues faced by the distribution shift or employed in inference time as a condition. Latent Drifting enables diffusion models to be conditioned for medical images fitted for the complex task of counterfactual image generation, which is crucial to investigate how parameters such as gender, age, and adding or removing diseases in a patient would alter the medical images. We evaluate our method on three public longitudinal benchmark datasets of brain MRI and chest X-rays for counterfactual image generation. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains in various scenarios when combined with different fine-tuning schemes. The source code of this work will be publicly released upon its acceptance.

- **Summary**: Generating high-quality whole-body human object interaction motion sequences is becoming increasingly important in various fields such as animation, VR/AR, and robotics. The main challenge of this task lies in determining the level of involvement of each hand given the complex shapes of objects in different sizes and their different motion trajectories, while ensuring strong grasping realism and guaranteeing the coordination of movement in all body parts. Contrasting with existing work, which either generates human interaction motion sequences without detailed hand grasping poses or only models a static grasping pose, we propose a simple yet effective framework that jointly models the relationship between the body, hands, and the given object motion sequences within a single diffusion model. To guide our network in perceiving the object's spatial position and learning more natural grasping poses, we introduce novel contact-aware losses and incorporate a data-driven, carefully designed guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method and generates plausible whole-body motion sequences.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained foundation models have recently significantly progressed in structured table understanding and reasoning. However, despite advancements in areas such as table semantic understanding and table question answering, recognizing the structure and content of unstructured tables using Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) remains under-explored. In this work, we address this research gap by employing VLLMs in a training-free reasoning paradigm. First, we design a benchmark with various hierarchical dimensions relevant to table recognition. Subsequently, we conduct in-depth evaluations using pre-trained VLLMs, finding that low-quality image input is a significant bottleneck in the recognition process. Drawing inspiration from these findings, we propose the Neighbor-Guided Toolchain Reasoner (NGTR) framework, which is characterized by integrating multiple lightweight models for low-level visual processing operations aimed at mitigating issues with low-quality input images. Specifically, we utilize a neighbor retrieval mechanism to guide the generation of multiple tool invocation plans, transferring tool selection experiences from similar neighbors to the given input, thereby facilitating suitable tool selection. Additionally, we introduce a reflection module to supervise the tool invocation process. Extensive experiments on public table recognition datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the recognition capabilities of the vanilla VLLMs. We believe that the designed benchmark and the proposed NGTR framework could provide an alternative solution in table recognition.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of remote sensing technology, high-resolution multi-modal imagery is now more widely accessible. Conventional Object detection models are trained on a single dataset, often restricted to a specific imaging modality and annotation format. However, such an approach overlooks the valuable shared knowledge across multi-modalities and limits the model's applicability in more versatile scenarios. This paper introduces a new task called Multi-Modal Datasets and Multi-Task Object Detection (M2Det) for remote sensing, designed to accurately detect horizontal or oriented objects from any sensor modality. This task poses challenges due to 1) the trade-offs involved in managing multi-modal modelling and 2) the complexities of multi-task optimization. To address these, we establish a benchmark dataset and propose a unified model, SM3Det (Single Model for Multi-Modal datasets and Multi-Task object Detection). SM3Det leverages a grid-level sparse MoE backbone to enable joint knowledge learning while preserving distinct feature representations for different modalities. Furthermore, it integrates a consistency and synchronization optimization strategy using dynamic learning rate adjustment, allowing it to effectively handle varying levels of learning difficulty across modalities and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate SM3Det's effectiveness and generalizability, consistently outperforming specialized models on individual datasets.

- **Summary**: Classical approaches to Vanishing Point Detection (VPD) rely solely on the presence of explicit straight lines in images, while recent supervised deep learning approaches need labeled datasets for training. We propose an alternative unsupervised approach: Recurrence-based Vanishing Point Detection (R-VPD) that uses implicit lines discovered from recurring correspondences in addition to explicit lines. Furthermore, we contribute two Recurring-Pattern-for-Vanishing-Point (RPVP) datasets: 1) a Synthetic Image dataset with 3,200 ground truth vanishing points and camera parameters, and 2) a Real-World Image dataset with 1,400 human annotated vanishing points. We compare our method with two classical methods and two state-of-the-art deep learning-based VPD methods. We demonstrate that our unsupervised approach outperforms all the methods on the synthetic images dataset, outperforms the classical methods, and is on par with the supervised learning approaches on real-world images.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer knowledge from a related, label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain, thereby circumventing the high costs associated with manual annotation. Recently, there has been growing interest in source-free domain adaptation, a paradigm in which only a pre-trained model, rather than the labeled source data, is provided to the target domain. Given the potential risk of source data leakage via model inversion attacks, this paper introduces a novel setting called black-box domain adaptation, where the source model is accessible only through an API that provides the predicted label along with the corresponding confidence value for each query. We develop a two-step framework named $\textbf{Pro}$totypical $\textbf{D}$istillation and $\textbf{D}$ebiased tun$\textbf{ing}$ ($\textbf{ProDDing}$). In the first step, ProDDing leverages both the raw predictions from the source model and prototypes derived from the target domain as teachers to distill a customized target model. In the second step, ProDDing keeps fine-tuning the distilled model by penalizing logits that are biased toward certain classes. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ProDDing outperforms existing black-box domain adaptation methods. Moreover, in the case of hard-label black-box domain adaptation, where only predicted labels are available, ProDDing achieves significant improvements over these methods. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/tim-learn/ProDDing/}.

- **Summary**: Vision language models (VLMs) like CLIP show stellar zero-shot capability on classification benchmarks. However, selecting the VLM with the highest performance on the unlabeled downstream task is non-trivial. Existing VLM selection methods focus on the class-name-only setting, relying on a supervised large-scale dataset and large language models, which may not be accessible or feasible during deployment. This paper introduces the problem of \textbf{unsupervised vision-language model selection}, where only unsupervised downstream datasets are available, with no additional information provided. To solve this problem, we propose a method termed Visual-tExtual Graph Alignment (VEGA), to select VLMs without any annotations by measuring the alignment of the VLM between the two modalities on the downstream task. VEGA is motivated by the pretraining paradigm of VLMs, which aligns features with the same semantics from the visual and textual modalities, thereby mapping both modalities into a shared representation space. Specifically, we first construct two graphs on the vision and textual features, respectively. VEGA is then defined as the overall similarity between the visual and textual graphs at both node and edge levels. Extensive experiments across three different benchmarks, covering a variety of application scenarios and downstream datasets, demonstrate that VEGA consistently provides reliable and accurate estimates of VLMs' performance on unlabeled downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Open-Set Object Detection (OSOD) has emerged as a contemporary research direction to address the detection of unknown objects. Recently, few works have achieved remarkable performance in the OSOD task by employing contrastive clustering to separate unknown classes. In contrast, we propose a new semantic clustering-based approach to facilitate a meaningful alignment of clusters in semantic space and introduce a class decorrelation module to enhance inter-cluster separation. Our approach further incorporates an object focus module to predict objectness scores, which enhances the detection of unknown objects. Further, we employ i) an evaluation technique that penalizes low-confidence outputs to mitigate the risk of misclassification of the unknown objects and ii) a new metric called HMP that combines known and unknown precision using harmonic mean. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves significant improvement on the MS-COCO & PASCAL VOC dataset for the OSOD task.

- **Summary**: Dramatic advances in the quality of the latent diffusion models (LDMs) also led to the malicious use of AI-generated images. While current AI-generated image detection methods assume the availability of real/AI-generated images for training, this is practically limited given the vast expressibility of LDMs. This motivates the training-free detection setup where no related data are available in advance. The existing LDM-generated image detection method assumes that images generated by LDM are easier to reconstruct using an autoencoder than real images. However, we observe that this reconstruction distance is overfitted to background information, leading the current method to underperform in detecting images with simple backgrounds. To address this, we propose a novel method called HFI. Specifically, by viewing the autoencoder of LDM as a downsampling-upsampling kernel, HFI measures the extent of aliasing, a distortion of high-frequency information that appears in the reconstructed image. HFI is training-free, efficient, and consistently outperforms other training-free methods in detecting challenging images generated by various generative models. We also show that HFI can successfully detect the images generated from the specified LDM as a means of implicit watermarking. HFI outperforms the best baseline method while achieving magnitudes of

- **Summary**: Accurate identification and localisation of brain tumours from medical images remain challenging due to tumour variability and structural complexity. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly ResNet and Unet, have made significant progress in medical image processing, offering robust capabilities for image segmentation. However, limited research has explored their integration with human-computer interaction (HCI) to enhance usability, interpretability, and clinical applicability. This paper introduces ResUnet++, an advanced hybrid model combining ResNet and Unet++, designed to improve tumour detection and localisation while fostering seamless interaction between clinicians and medical imaging systems. ResUnet++ integrates residual blocks in both the downsampling and upsampling phases, ensuring critical image features are preserved. By incorporating HCI principles, the model provides intuitive, real-time feedback, enabling clinicians to visualise and interact with tumour localisation results effectively. This fosters informed decision-making and supports workflow efficiency in clinical settings. We evaluated ResUnet++ on the LGG Segmentation Dataset, achieving a Jaccard Loss of 98.17%. The results demonstrate its strong segmentation performance and potential for real-world applications. By bridging advanced medical imaging techniques with HCI, ResUnet++ offers a foundation for developing interactive diagnostic tools, improving clinician trust, decision accuracy, and patient outcomes, and advancing the integration of AI in healthcare workflows.

- **Summary**: Recently, large foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs), have become essential tools in critical fields such as law, finance, and healthcare. As these models increasingly integrate into our daily life, it is necessary to conduct moral evaluation to ensure that their outputs align with human values and remain within moral boundaries. Previous works primarily focus on LLMs, proposing moral datasets and benchmarks limited to text modality. However, given the rapid development of LVLMs, there is still a lack of multimodal moral evaluation methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce M$^3$oralBench, the first MultiModal Moral Benchmark for LVLMs. M$^3$oralBench expands the everyday moral scenarios in Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs) and employs the text-to-image diffusion model, SD3.0, to create corresponding scenario images. It conducts moral evaluation across six moral foundations of Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) and encompasses tasks in moral judgement, moral classification, and moral response, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance in multimodal moral understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 popular open-source and closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that M$^3$oralBench is a challenging benchmark, exposing notable moral limitations in current models. Our benchmark is publicly available.

- **Summary**: Dynamic 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis from captured videos are crucial for enabling immersive experiences required by AR/VR and metaverse applications. However, this task is challenging due to the complexity of unconstrained real-world scenes and their temporal dynamics. In this paper, we frame dynamic scenes as a spatio-temporal 4D volume learning problem, offering a native explicit reformulation with minimal assumptions about motion, which serves as a versatile dynamic scene learning framework. Specifically, we represent a target dynamic scene using a collection of 4D Gaussian primitives with explicit geometry and appearance features, dubbed as 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS). This approach can capture relevant information in space and time by fitting the underlying spatio-temporal volume. Modeling the spacetime as a whole with 4D Gaussians parameterized by anisotropic ellipses that can rotate arbitrarily in space and time, our model can naturally learn view-dependent and time-evolved appearance with 4D spherindrical harmonics. Notably, our 4DGS model is the first solution that supports real-time rendering of high-resolution, photorealistic novel views for complex dynamic scenes. To enhance efficiency, we derive several compact variants that effectively reduce memory footprint and mitigate the risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of 4DGS in terms of visual quality and efficiency across a range of dynamic scene-related tasks (e.g., novel view synthesis, 4D generation, scene understanding) and scenarios (e.g., single object, indoor scenes, driving environments, synthetic and real data).

- **Summary**: Recent advances in AI-driven storytelling have enhanced video generation and story visualization. However, translating dialogue-centric scripts into coherent storyboards remains a significant challenge due to limited script detail, inadequate physical context understanding, and the complexity of integrating cinematic principles. To address these challenges, we propose Dialogue Visualization, a novel task that transforms dialogue scripts into dynamic, multi-view storyboards. We introduce Dialogue Director, a training-free multimodal framework comprising a Script Director, Cinematographer, and Storyboard Maker. This framework leverages large multimodal models and diffusion-based architectures, employing techniques such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and multi-view synthesis to improve script understanding, physical context comprehension, and cinematic knowledge integration. Experimental results demonstrate that Dialogue Director outperforms state-of-the-art methods in script interpretation, physical world understanding, and cinematic principle application, significantly advancing the quality and controllability of dialogue-based story visualization.

The experimental work includes a real-life knee rehabilitation video dataset capturing a set of exercises from simple and personalised to more general and challenging movements aimed for returning to sport. To convert video from mobile into privacy-preserving diagnostic timeseries data, we employed Google MediaPipe pose estimation. The developed proof-of-concept algorithms can augment knee exercise videos by overlaying the patient with stick figure elements while updating generated timeseries plot with knee angle estimation streamed as CSV file format. For patients and physiotherapists, video with side-to-side timeseries visually indicating potential issues such as excessive knee flexion or unstable knee movements or stick figure overlay errors is possible by setting a-priori knee-angle parameters. To address adherence to rehabilitation programme and quantify exercise sets and repetitions, our adaptive algorithm can correctly identify (91.67%-100%) of all exercises from side- and front-view videos. Transparent algorithm design for adaptive visual analysis of various knee exercise patterns contributes towards the interpretable AI and will inform near-future privacy-preserving, non-vendor locking, open-source developments for both end-user computing devices and as on-premises non-proprietary cloud platforms that can be deployed within the national healthcare system.

- **Summary**: The domain gap between remote sensing imagery and natural images has recently received widespread attention and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated excellent generalization performance in remote sensing multimodal tasks. However, current research is still limited in exploring how remote sensing VLMs handle different types of visual inputs. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UniRS}, the first vision-language model \textbf{uni}fying multi-temporal \textbf{r}emote \textbf{s}ensing tasks across various types of visual input. UniRS supports single images, dual-time image pairs, and videos as input, enabling comprehensive remote sensing temporal analysis within a unified framework. We adopt a unified visual representation approach, enabling the model to accept various visual inputs. For dual-time image pair tasks, we customize a change extraction module to further enhance the extraction of spatiotemporal features. Additionally, we design a prompt augmentation mechanism tailored to the model's reasoning process, utilizing the prior knowledge of the general-purpose VLM to provide clues for UniRS. To promote multi-task knowledge sharing, the model is jointly fine-tuned on a mixed dataset. Experimental results show that UniRS achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including visual question answering, change captioning, and video scene classification, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in unifying these multi-temporal remote sensing tasks. Our code and dataset will be released soon.

- **Summary**: In this article, an active contours without edges (ACWE)-based algorithm has been proposed for the detection of solar filaments in H-alpha full-disk solar images. The overall algorithm consists of three main steps of image processing. These are image pre-processing, image segmentation, and image post-processing. Here in the work, contours are initialized on the solar image and allowed to deform based on the energy function. As soon as the contour reaches the boundary of the desired object, the energy function gets reduced, and the contour stops evolving. The proposed algorithm has been applied to few benchmark datasets and has been compared with the classical technique of object detection. The results analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the results obtained using the existing classical algorithm of object detection.

- **Summary**: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced by aligning vision inputs with text, significantly improving performance in computer vision tasks. Moreover, for VLMs to be effectively utilized in real-world applications, an understanding of diverse multi-vision sensor data, such as thermal, depth, and X-ray information, is essential. However, we find that current VLMs process multi-vision sensor images without deep understanding of sensor information, disregarding each sensor's unique physical properties. This limitation restricts their capacity to interpret and respond to complex questions requiring multi-vision sensor reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-vision Sensor Perception and Reasoning (MS-PR) benchmark, assessing VLMs on their capacity for sensor-specific reasoning. Moreover, we introduce Diverse Negative Attributes (DNA) optimization to enable VLMs to perform deep reasoning on multi-vision sensor tasks, helping to bridge the core information gap between images and sensor data. Extensive experimental results validate that the proposed DNA method can significantly improve the multi-vision sensor reasoning for VLMs.

- **Summary**: We introduce intra-class memorability, where certain images within the same class are more memorable than others despite shared category characteristics. To investigate what features make one object instance more memorable than others, we design and conduct human behavior experiments, where participants are shown a series of images one at a time, and they must identify when the current item matches the item presented a few steps back in the sequence. To quantify memorability, we propose the Intra-Class Memorability score (ICMscore), a novel metric that incorporates the temporal intervals between repeated image presentations into its calculation. Our contributions open new pathways in understanding intra-class memorability by scrutinizing fine-grained visual features that result in the least and most memorable images and laying the groundwork for real-world applications in cognitive science and computer vision.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing high-quality 3D models from sparse 2D images has garnered significant attention in computer vision. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained prominence due to its explicit representation with efficient training speed and real-time rendering capabilities. However, existing methods still heavily depend on accurate camera poses for reconstruction. Although some recent approaches attempt to train 3DGS models without the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) preprocessing from monocular video datasets, these methods suffer from prolonged training times, making them impractical for many applications.   In this paper, we present an efficient framework that operates without any depth or matching model. Our approach initially uses SfM to quickly obtain rough camera poses within seconds, and then refines these poses by leveraging the dense representation in 3DGS. This framework effectively addresses the issue of long training times. Additionally, we integrate the densification process with joint refinement and propose a coarse-to-fine frequency-aware densification to reconstruct different levels of details. This approach prevents camera pose estimation from being trapped in local minima or drifting due to high-frequency signals. Our method significantly reduces training time from hours to minutes while achieving more accurate novel view synthesis and camera pose estimation compared to previous methods.

- **Summary**: Face recognition has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, thanks to the development of deep learning techniques.However, an off-the-shelf face recognition model as a commercial service could be stolen by model stealing attacks, posing great threats to the rights of the model owner.Model fingerprinting, as a model stealing detection method, aims to verify whether a suspect model is stolen from the victim model, gaining more and more attention nowadays.Previous methods always utilize transferable adversarial examples as the model fingerprint, but this method is known to be sensitive to adversarial defense and transfer learning techniques.To address this issue, we consider the pairwise relationship between samples instead and propose a novel yet simple model stealing detection method based on SAmple Correlation (SAC).Specifically, we present SAC-JC that selects JPEG compressed samples as model inputs and calculates the correlation matrix among their model outputs.Extensive results validate that SAC successfully defends against various model stealing attacks in deep face recognition, encompassing face verification and face emotion recognition, exhibiting the highest performance in terms of AUC, p-value and F1 score.Furthermore, we extend our evaluation of SAC-JC to object recognition datasets including Tiny-ImageNet and CIFAR10, which also demonstrates the superior performance of SAC-JC to previous methods.The code will be available at \url{https://github.com/guanjiyang/SAC_JC}.

- **Summary**: Deep learning's preponderance across scientific domains has reshaped high-stakes decision-making, making it essential to follow rigorous operational frameworks that include both Right-to-Privacy (RTP) and Right-to-Explanation (RTE). This paper examines the complexities of combining these two requirements. For RTP, we focus on `Differential privacy' (DP), which is considered the current \textit{gold standard} for privacy-preserving machine learning due to its strong quantitative guarantee of privacy. For RTE, we focus on post-hoc explainers: they are the \textit{go-to} option for model auditing as they operate independently of model training. We formally investigate DP models and various commonly-used post-hoc explainers: how to evaluate these explainers subject to RTP, and analyze the intrinsic interactions between DP models and these explainers. Furthermore, our work throws light on how RTP and RTE can be effectively combined in high-stakes applications. Our study concludes by outlining an industrial software pipeline, with the example of a wildly used use-case, that respects both RTP and RTE requirements.

- **Summary**: While diffusion models show extraordinary talents in text-to-image generation, they may still fail to generate highly aesthetic images. More specifically, there is still a gap between the generated images and the real-world aesthetic images in finer-grained dimensions including color, lighting, composition, etc. In this paper, we propose Cross-Attention Value Mixing Control (VMix) Adapter, a plug-and-play aesthetics adapter, to upgrade the quality of generated images while maintaining generality across visual concepts by (1) disentangling the input text prompt into the content description and aesthetic description by the initialization of aesthetic embedding, and (2) integrating aesthetic conditions into the denoising process through value-mixed cross-attention, with the network connected by zero-initialized linear layers. Our key insight is to enhance the aesthetic presentation of existing diffusion models by designing a superior condition control method, all while preserving the image-text alignment. Through our meticulous design, VMix is flexible enough to be applied to community models for better visual performance without retraining. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive experiments, showing that VMix outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and is compatible with other community modules (e.g., LoRA, ControlNet, and IPAdapter) for image generation.

- **Summary**: A plethora of face forgery detectors exist to tackle facial deepfake risks. However, their practical application is hindered by the challenge of generalizing to forgeries unseen during the training stage. To this end, we introduce an insertable adaptation module that can adapt a trained off-the-shelf detector using only online unlabeled test data, without requiring modifications to the architecture or training process. Specifically, we first present a learnable class prototype-based classifier that generates predictions from the revised features and prototypes, enabling effective handling of various forgery clues and domain gaps during online testing. Additionally, we propose a nearest feature calibrator to further improve prediction accuracy and reduce the impact of noisy pseudo-labels during self-training. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our module achieves superior generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, it functions as a plug-and-play component that can be combined with various detectors to enhance the overall performance.

- **Summary**: Event cameras are biologically inspired sensors that emit events asynchronously with remarkable temporal resolution, garnering significant attention from both industry and academia. Mainstream methods favor frame and voxel representations, which reach a satisfactory performance while introducing time-consuming transformation, bulky models, and sacrificing fine-grained temporal information. Alternatively, Point Cloud representation demonstrates promise in addressing the mentioned weaknesses, but it ignores the polarity information, and its models have limited proficiency in abstracting long-term events' features. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware network named FECNet that leverages Event Cloud representations. FECNet fully utilizes 2S-1T-1P Event Cloud by innovating the event-based Group and Sampling module. To accommodate the long sequence events from Event Cloud, FECNet embraces feature extraction in the frequency domain via the Fourier transform. This approach substantially extinguishes the explosion of Multiply Accumulate Operations (MACs) while effectively abstracting spatial-temporal features. We conducted extensive experiments on event-based object classification, action recognition, and human pose estimation tasks, and the results substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of FECNet.

- **Summary**: With much longer optimization time than that of untargeted attacks notwithstanding, the transferability of targeted attacks is still far from satisfactory. Recent studies reveal that fine-tuning an existing adversarial example (AE) in feature space can efficiently boost its targeted transferability. However, existing fine-tuning schemes only utilize the endpoint and ignore the valuable information in the fine-tuning trajectory. Noting that the vanilla fine-tuning trajectory tends to oscillate around the periphery of a flat region of the loss surface, we propose averaging over the fine-tuning trajectory to pull the crafted AE towards a more centered region. We compare the proposed method with existing fine-tuning schemes by integrating them with state-of-the-art targeted attacks in various attacking scenarios. Experimental results uphold the superiority of the proposed method in boosting targeted transferability. The code is available at github.com/zengh5/Avg_FT.

- **Summary**: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) aims to localize moments within a video based on a given natural language query. Given the prevalent use of platforms like YouTube for information retrieval, the demand for MR techniques is significantly growing. Recent DETR-based models have made notable advances in performance but still struggle with accurately localizing short moments. Through data analysis, we identified limited feature diversity in short moments, which motivated the development of MomentMix. MomentMix employs two augmentation strategies: ForegroundMix and BackgroundMix, each enhancing the feature representations of the foreground and background, respectively. Additionally, our analysis of prediction bias revealed that short moments particularly struggle with accurately predicting their center positions of moments. To address this, we propose a Length-Aware Decoder, which conditions length through a novel bipartite matching process. Our extensive studies demonstrate the efficacy of our length-aware approach, especially in localizing short moments, leading to improved overall performance. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art DETR-based methods on benchmark datasets, achieving the highest R1 and mAP on QVHighlights and the highest R1@0.7 on TACoS and Charades-STA (such as a 2.46% gain in R1@0.7 and a 2.57% gain in mAP average for QVHighlights).

- **Summary**: Unsupervised deep learning is a promising method in brain MRI registration to reduce the reliance on anatomical labels, while still achieving anatomically accurate transformations. For the Learn2Reg2024 LUMIR challenge, we propose fine-tuning of the pre-trained TransMorph model to improve the convergence stability as well as the deformation smoothness. The former is achieved through the FAdam optimizer, and consistency in structural changes is incorporated through the addition of gradient correlation in the similarity measure, improving anatomical alignment. The results show slight improvements in the Dice and HdDist95 scores, and a notable reduction in the NDV compared to the baseline TransMorph model. These are also confirmed by inspecting the boundaries of the tissue. Our proposed method highlights the effectiveness of including Gradient Correlation to achieve smoother and structurally consistent deformations for interpatient brain MRI registration.

- **Summary**: Transparent objects are ubiquitous in daily life, making their perception and robotics manipulation important. However, they present a major challenge due to their distinct refractive and reflective properties when it comes to accurately estimating the 6D pose. To solve this, we present ReFlow6D, a novel method for transparent object 6D pose estimation that harnesses the refractive-intermediate representation. Unlike conventional approaches, our method leverages a feature space impervious to changes in RGB image space and independent of depth information. Drawing inspiration from image matting, we model the deformation of the light path through transparent objects, yielding a unique object-specific intermediate representation guided by light refraction that is independent of the environment in which objects are observed. By integrating these intermediate features into the pose estimation network, we show that ReFlow6D achieves precise 6D pose estimation of transparent objects, using only RGB images as input. Our method further introduces a novel transparent object compositing loss, fostering the generation of superior refractive-intermediate features. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TOD and Trans32K-6D datasets. Robot grasping experiments further demonstrate that ReFlow6D's pose estimation accuracy effectively translates to real-world robotics task.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of wind turbine blade (WTB) images is critical for effective assessments, as it directly influences the performance of automated damage detection systems. Despite advancements in large universal vision models, these models often underperform in domain-specific tasks like WTB segmentation. To address this, we extend Intrinsic LoRA for image segmentation, and propose a novel dual-space augmentation strategy that integrates both image-level and latent-space augmentations. The image-space augmentation is achieved through linear interpolation between image pairs, while the latent-space augmentation is accomplished by introducing a noise-based latent probabilistic model. Our approach significantly boosts segmentation accuracy, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods in WTB image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Although mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) (including image-level classification and pixel-level segmentation)algorithms perform well in academic datasets, their performance is limited in practical application due to the ideal experimental setting of clean training data. Training with noisy data is an inevitable problem in real-world anomaly detection but is seldom discussed. This paper is the first to consider fully unsupervised industrial anomaly detection (i.e., unsupervised AD with noisy data). To solve this problem, we proposed memory-based unsupervised AD methods, SoftPatch and SoftPatch+, which efficiently denoise the data at the patch level. Noise discriminators are utilized to generate outlier scores for patch-level noise elimination before coreset construction. The scores are then stored in the memory bank to soften the anomaly detection boundary. Compared with existing methods, SoftPatch maintains a strong modeling ability of normal data and alleviates the overconfidence problem in coreset, and SoftPatch+ has more robust performance which is articularly useful in real-world industrial inspection scenarios with high levels of noise (from 10% to 40%). Comprehensive experiments conducted in diverse noise scenarios demonstrate that both SoftPatch and SoftPatch+ outperform the state-of-the-art AD methods on the MVTecAD, ViSA, and BTAD benchmarks. Furthermore, the performance of SoftPatch and SoftPatch+ is comparable to that of the noise-free methods in conventional unsupervised AD setting.

- **Summary**: Audio-visual video parsing focuses on classifying videos through weak labels while identifying events as either visible, audible, or both, alongside their respective temporal boundaries. Many methods ignore that different modalities often lack alignment, thereby introducing extra noise during modal interaction. In this work, we introduce a Learning Interaction method for Non-aligned Knowledge (LINK), designed to equilibrate the contributions of distinct modalities by dynamically adjusting their input during event prediction. Additionally, we leverage the semantic information of pseudo-labels as a priori knowledge to mitigate noise from other modalities. Our experimental findings demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods on the LLP dataset.

- **Summary**: Advancements in deep learning are driven by training models with increasingly larger numbers of parameters, which in turn heightens the computational demands. To address this issue, Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) models have been proposed to dynamically assign computations only to the most relevant parts of the inputs, thereby enabling the deployment of large-parameter models with high efficiency during inference and training. These MoD models utilize a routing mechanism to determine which tokens should be processed by a layer, or skipped. However, conventional MoD models employ additional network layers specifically for the routing which are difficult to train, and add complexity and deployment overhead to the model. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention-based routing mechanism A-MoD that leverages the existing attention map of the preceding layer for routing decisions within the current layer. Compared to standard routing, A-MoD allows for more efficient training as it introduces no additional trainable parameters and can be easily adapted from pretrained transformer models. Furthermore, it can increase the performance of the MoD model. For instance, we observe up to 2% higher accuracy on ImageNet compared to standard routing and isoFLOP ViT baselines. Furthermore, A-MoD improves the MoD training convergence, leading to up to 2x faster transfer learning.

- **Summary**: Panoptic segmentation, which combines instance and semantic segmentation, has gained a lot of attention in autonomous vehicles, due to its comprehensive representation of the scene. This task can be applied for cameras and LiDAR sensors, but there has been a limited focus on combining both sensors to enhance image panoptic segmentation (PS). Although previous research has acknowledged the benefit of 3D data on camera-based scene perception, no specific study has explored the influence of 3D data on image and video panoptic segmentation (VPS).This work seeks to introduce a feature fusion module that enhances PS and VPS by fusing LiDAR and image data for autonomous vehicles. We also illustrate that, in addition to this fusion, our proposed model, which utilizes two simple modifications, can further deliver even more high-quality VPS without being trained on video data. The results demonstrate a substantial improvement in both the image and video panoptic segmentation evaluation metrics by up to 5 points.

- **Summary**: So far, efficient fine-tuning has become a popular strategy for enhancing the capabilities of foundation models on downstream tasks by learning plug-and-play modules. However, existing methods overlook a crucial issue: if the underlying foundation model is updated, are these plug-and-play modules still effective? In this paper, we first conduct a detailed analysis of various fine-tuning methods on the CLIP in terms of their compatibility with model updates. The study reveals that many high-performing fine-tuning methods fail to be compatible with the upgraded models. To address this, we propose a novel approach, Class-conditioned Context Optimization (ContCoOp), which integrates learnable prompts with class embeddings using an attention layer before inputting them into the text encoder. Consequently, the prompts can dynamically adapt to the changes in embedding space (due to model updates), ensuring continued effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 15 datasets show that our ContCoOp achieves the highest compatibility over the baseline methods, and exhibits robust out-of-distribution generalization.

- **Summary**: Generative AIBIM, a successful structural design pipeline, has proven its ability to intelligently generate high-quality, diverse, and creative shear wall designs that are tailored to specific physical conditions. However, the current module of Generative AIBIM that generates designs, known as the physics-based conditional diffusion model (PCDM), necessitates 1000 iterations for each generation due to its reliance on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) sampling process. This leads to a time-consuming and computationally demanding generation process. To address this issue, this study introduces the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), an accelerated generation method that replaces the DDPM sampling process in PCDM. While the original DDIM was designed for DDPM and the optimization process of PCDM differs from that of DDPM, this paper designs "DDIM sampling for PCDM," which modifies the original DDIM formulations to adapt to the optimization process of PCDM. Experimental results demonstrate that DDIM sampling for PCDM can accelerate the generation process of the original PCDM by a factor of 100 while maintaining the same visual quality in the generated results. This study effectively showcases the effectiveness of DDIM sampling for PCDM in expediting intelligent structural design. Furthermore, this paper reorganizes the contents of DDIM, focusing on the practical usage of DDIM. This change is particularly meaningful for researchers who may not possess a strong background in machine learning theory but are interested in utilizing the tool effectively.

- **Summary**: High-quality animated stickers usually contain transparent channels, which are often ignored by current video generation models. To generate fine-grained animated transparency channels, existing methods can be roughly divided into video matting algorithms and diffusion-based algorithms. The methods based on video matting have poor performance in dealing with semi-open areas in stickers, while diffusion-based methods are often used to model a single image, which will lead to local flicker when modeling animated stickers. In this paper, we firstly propose an ILDiff method to generate animated transparent channels through implicit layout distillation, which solves the problems of semi-open area collapse and no consideration of temporal information in existing methods. Secondly, we create the Transparent Animated Sticker Dataset (TASD), which contains 0.32M high-quality samples with transparent channel, to provide data support for related fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ILDiff can produce finer and smoother transparent channels compared to other methods such as Matting Anything and Layer Diffusion.

- **Summary**: Approximately 200 million individuals around the world suffer from varying degrees of visual impairment, making it crucial to leverage AI technology to offer walking assistance for these people. With the recent progress of vision-language models (VLMs), employing VLMs to improve this field has emerged as a popular research topic. However, most existing methods are studied on self-built question-answering datasets, lacking a unified training and testing benchmark for walk guidance. Moreover, in blind walking task, it is necessary to perform real-time streaming video parsing and generate concise yet informative reminders, which poses a great challenge for VLMs that suffer from redundant responses and low inference efficiency. In this paper, we firstly release a diverse, extensive, and unbiased walking awareness dataset, containing 12k video-manual annotation pairs from Europe and Asia to provide a fair training and testing benchmark for blind walking task. Furthermore, a WalkVLM model is proposed, which employs chain of thought for hierarchical planning to generate concise but informative reminders and utilizes temporal-aware adaptive prediction to reduce the temporal redundancy of reminders. Finally, we have established a solid benchmark for blind walking task and verified the advantages of WalkVLM in stream video processing for this task compared to other VLMs. Our dataset and code will be released at anonymous link https://walkvlm2024.github.io.

- **Summary**: Accurate multi-view 3D object detection is essential for applications such as autonomous driving. Researchers have consistently aimed to leverage LiDAR's precise spatial information to enhance camera-based detectors through methods like depth supervision and bird-eye-view (BEV) feature distillation. However, existing approaches often face challenges due to the inherent differences between LiDAR and camera data representations. In this paper, we introduce the TiGDistill-BEV, a novel approach that effectively bridges this gap by leveraging the strengths of both sensors. Our method distills knowledge from diverse modalities(e.g., LiDAR) as the teacher model to a camera-based student detector, utilizing the Target Inner-Geometry learning scheme to enhance camera-based BEV detectors through both depth and BEV features by leveraging diverse modalities. Specially, we propose two key modules: an inner-depth supervision module to learn the low-level relative depth relations within objects which equips detectors with a deeper understanding of object-level spatial structures, and an inner-feature BEV distillation module to transfer high-level semantics of different key points within foreground targets. To further alleviate the domain gap, we incorporate both inter-channel and inter-keypoint distillation to model feature similarity. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that TiGDistill-BEV significantly boosts camera-based only detectors achieving a state-of-the-art with 62.8% NDS and surpassing previous methods by a significant margin.

- **Summary**: Although significant progress has been made in enhancing visibility, retrieving texture details, and mitigating noise in Low-Light (LL) images, the challenge persists in applying current Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods to real-world scenarios, primarily due to the diverse illumination conditions encountered. Furthermore, the quest for generating enhancements that are visually realistic and attractive remains an underexplored realm. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel \textbf{LLIE} framework with the guidance of \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{P}riors (\textbf{GPP-LLIE}) derived from vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we first propose a pipeline that guides VLMs to assess multiple visual attributes of the LL image and quantify the assessment to output the global and local perceptual priors. Subsequently, to incorporate these generative perceptual priors to benefit LLIE, we introduce a transformer-based backbone in the diffusion process, and develop a new layer normalization (\textit{\textbf{GPP-LN}}) and an attention mechanism (\textit{\textbf{LPP-Attn}}) guided by global and local perceptual priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms current SOTA methods on paired LL datasets and exhibits superior generalization on real-world data.

- **Summary**: Tissue semantic segmentation is one of the key tasks in computational pathology. To avoid the expensive and laborious acquisition of pixel-level annotations, a wide range of studies attempt to adopt the class activation map (CAM), a weakly-supervised learning scheme, to achieve pixel-level tissue segmentation. However, CAM-based methods are prone to suffer from under-activation and over-activation issues, leading to poor segmentation performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel weakly-supervised semantic segmentation framework for histopathological images based on image-mixing synthesis and consistency regularization, dubbed HisynSeg. Specifically, synthesized histopathological images with pixel-level masks are generated for fully-supervised model training, where two synthesis strategies are proposed based on Mosaic transformation and B\'ezier mask generation. Besides, an image filtering module is developed to guarantee the authenticity of the synthesized images. In order to further avoid the model overfitting to the occasional synthesis artifacts, we additionally propose a novel self-supervised consistency regularization, which enables the real images without segmentation masks to supervise the training of the segmentation model. By integrating the proposed techniques, the HisynSeg framework successfully transforms the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation problem into a fully-supervised one, greatly improving the segmentation accuracy. Experimental results on three datasets prove that the proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Vison307/HisynSeg.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini, LLaVA, and Flamingo, have made significant progress in integrating visual and textual modalities, excelling in tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and content retrieval. They can generate coherent and contextually relevant descriptions of images. However, they still face challenges in accurately identifying and counting objects and determining their spatial locations, particularly in complex scenes with overlapping or small objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which introduces structured scene graphs to enhance object recognition, relationship identification, and spatial understanding within images. Our framework improves the MLLM's capacity to handle tasks requiring precise visual descriptions, especially in scenarios with challenging perspectives, such as aerial views or scenes with dense object arrangements. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the VG-150 dataset that focuses on first-person visual understanding and the AUG dataset that involves aerial imagery. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing MLLMs in VQA tasks, which stands out in recognizing, localizing, and quantifying objects in different spatial contexts and provides more accurate visual descriptions.

- **Summary**: Multimodal representation learning, with contrastive learning, plays an important role in the artificial intelligence domain. As an important subfield, video-language representation learning focuses on learning representations using global semantic interactions between pre-defined video-text pairs. However, to enhance and refine such coarse-grained global interactions, more detailed interactions are necessary for fine-grained multimodal learning. In this study, we introduce a new approach that models video-text as game players using multivariate cooperative game theory to handle uncertainty during fine-grained semantic interactions with diverse granularity, flexible combination, and vague intensity. Specifically, we design the Hierarchical Banzhaf Interaction to simulate the fine-grained correspondence between video clips and textual words from hierarchical perspectives. Furthermore, to mitigate the bias in calculations within Banzhaf Interaction, we propose reconstructing the representation through a fusion of single-modal and cross-modal components. This reconstructed representation ensures fine granularity comparable to that of the single-modal representation, while also preserving the adaptive encoding characteristics of cross-modal representation. Additionally, we extend our original structure into a flexible encoder-decoder framework, enabling the model to adapt to various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on commonly used text-video retrieval, video-question answering, and video captioning benchmarks, with superior performance, validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted in computer vision. Complex CNN architecture running on CPU or GPU has either insufficient throughput or prohibitive power consumption. Hence, there is a need to have dedicated hardware to accelerate the computation workload to solve these limitations. In this paper, we accelerate a CNN for image classification with the CIFAR-10 dataset using Vitis-AI on Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 FPGA evaluation board. The work achieves 3.33-5.82x higher throughput and 3.39-6.30x higher energy efficiency than CPU and GPU baselines. It shows the potential to extract 2D features for downstream tasks, such as depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced content-based retrieval methods, notably through models like CLIP that map images and texts into a shared embedding space. However, these methods often struggle with domain-specific entities and long-tail concepts absent from their training data, particularly in identifying specific individuals. In this paper, we explore the task of identity-aware cross-modal retrieval, which aims to retrieve images of persons in specific contexts based on natural language queries. This task is critical in various scenarios, such as for searching and browsing personalized video collections or large audio-visual archives maintained by national broadcasters. We introduce a novel dataset, COCO Person FaceSwap (COCO-PFS), derived from the widely used COCO dataset and enriched with deepfake-generated faces from VGGFace2. This dataset addresses the lack of large-scale datasets needed for training and evaluating models for this task. Our experiments assess the performance of different CLIP variations repurposed for this task, including our architecture, Identity-aware CLIP (Id-CLIP), which achieves competitive retrieval performance through targeted fine-tuning. Our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust cross-modal retrieval systems capable of recognizing long-tail identities and contextual nuances.

- **Summary**: Blind face restoration aims to recover high-quality facial images from various unidentified sources of degradation, posing significant challenges due to the minimal information retrievable from the degraded images. Prior knowledge-based methods, leveraging geometric priors and facial features, have led to advancements in face restoration but often fall short of capturing fine details. To address this, we introduce a visual style prompt learning framework that utilizes diffusion probabilistic models to explicitly generate visual prompts within the latent space of pre-trained generative models. These prompts are designed to guide the restoration process. To fully utilize the visual prompts and enhance the extraction of informative and rich patterns, we introduce a style-modulated aggregation transformation layer. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate the superiority of our method in achieving high-quality blind face restoration.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, they face several inherent limitations, including a training-sampling gap, information leakage in the progressive noising process, and the inability to incorporate advanced loss functions like perceptual and adversarial losses during training. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative end-to-end training framework that aligns the training and sampling processes by directly optimizing the final reconstruction output. Our method eliminates the training-sampling gap, mitigates information leakage by treating the training process as a direct mapping from pure noise to the target data distribution, and enables the integration of perceptual and adversarial losses into the objective. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as COCO30K and HW30K demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms traditional diffusion models, achieving superior results in terms of FID and CLIP score, even with reduced sampling steps. These findings highlight the potential of end-to-end training to advance diffusion-based generative models toward more robust and efficient solutions.

- **Summary**: We present a general strategy to aligning visual generation models -- both image and video generation -- with human preference. To start with, we build VisionReward -- a fine-grained and multi-dimensional reward model. We decompose human preferences in images and videos into multiple dimensions, each represented by a series of judgment questions, linearly weighted and summed to an interpretable and accurate score. To address the challenges of video quality assessment, we systematically analyze various dynamic features of videos, which helps VisionReward surpass VideoScore by 17.2% and achieve top performance for video preference prediction. Based on VisionReward, we develop a multi-objective preference learning algorithm that effectively addresses the issue of confounding factors within preference data. Our approach significantly outperforms existing image and video scoring methods on both machine metrics and human evaluation.

- **Summary**: Generative models trained on extensive high-quality datasets effectively capture the structural and statistical properties of clean images, rendering them powerful priors for transforming degraded features into clean ones in image restoration. VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.

- **Summary**: As a verified need, consistent editing across in-the-wild images remains a technical challenge arising from various unmanageable factors, like object poses, lighting conditions, and photography environments. Edicho steps in with a training-free solution based on diffusion models, featuring a fundamental design principle of using explicit image correspondence to direct editing. Specifically, the key components include an attention manipulation module and a carefully refined classifier-free guidance (CFG) denoising strategy, both of which take into account the pre-estimated correspondence. Such an inference-time algorithm enjoys a plug-and-play nature and is compatible to most diffusion-based editing methods, such as ControlNet and BrushNet. Extensive results demonstrate the efficacy of Edicho in consistent cross-image editing under diverse settings. We will release the code to facilitate future studies.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce Prometheus, a 3D-aware latent diffusion model for text-to-3D generation at both object and scene levels in seconds. We formulate 3D scene generation as multi-view, feed-forward, pixel-aligned 3D Gaussian generation within the latent diffusion paradigm. To ensure generalizability, we build our model upon pre-trained text-to-image generation model with only minimal adjustments, and further train it using a large number of images from both single-view and multi-view datasets. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-D latent space into 3D Gaussian generation to disentangle appearance and geometry information, enabling efficient feed-forward generation of 3D Gaussians with better fidelity and geometry. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both feed-forward 3D Gaussian reconstruction and text-to-3D generation.

- **Summary**: With rapid advancements in virtual reality (VR) headsets, effectively measuring stereoscopic quality of experience (SQoE) has become essential for delivering immersive and comfortable 3D experiences. However, most existing stereo metrics focus on isolated aspects of the viewing experience such as visual discomfort or image quality, and have traditionally faced data limitations. To address these gaps, we present SCOPE (Stereoscopic COntent Preference Evaluation), a new dataset comprised of real and synthetic stereoscopic images featuring a wide range of common perceptual distortions and artifacts. The dataset is labeled with preference annotations collected on a VR headset, with our findings indicating a notable degree of consistency in user preferences across different headsets. Additionally, we present iSQoE, a new model for stereo quality of experience assessment trained on our dataset. We show that iSQoE aligns better with human preferences than existing methods when comparing mono-to-stereo conversion methods.

- **Summary**: Dataset condensation has made significant progress in the image domain. Unlike images, videos possess an additional temporal dimension, which harbors considerable redundant information, making condensation even more crucial. However, video dataset condensation still remains an underexplored area. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a large-scale empirical study with systematic design and fair comparison. Specifically, our work delves into three key aspects to provide valuable empirical insights: (1) temporal processing of video data, (2) establishing a comprehensive evaluation protocol for video dataset condensation, and (3) adaptation of condensation methods to the space-time domain and fair comparisons among them. From this study, we derive several intriguing observations: (i) sample diversity appears to be more crucial than temporal diversity for video dataset condensation, (ii) simple slide-window sampling proves to be effective, and (iii) sample selection currently outperforms dataset distillation in most cases. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on three prominent action recognition datasets (HMDB51, UCF101 and Kinetics-400) and achieve state-of-the-art results on all of them.

- **Summary**: We propose action-agnostic point-level (AAPL) supervision for temporal action detection to achieve accurate action instance detection with a lightly annotated dataset. In the proposed scheme, a small portion of video frames is sampled in an unsupervised manner and presented to human annotators, who then label the frames with action categories. Unlike point-level supervision, which requires annotators to search for every action instance in an untrimmed video, frames to annotate are selected without human intervention in AAPL supervision. We also propose a detection model and learning method to effectively utilize the AAPL labels. Extensive experiments on the variety of datasets (THUMOS '14, FineAction, GTEA, BEOID, and ActivityNet 1.3) demonstrate that the proposed approach is competitive with or outperforms prior methods for video-level and point-level supervision in terms of the trade-off between the annotation cost and detection performance.

- **Summary**: We present PERSE, a method for building an animatable personalized generative avatar from a reference portrait. Our avatar model enables facial attribute editing in a continuous and disentangled latent space to control each facial attribute, while preserving the individual's identity. To achieve this, our method begins by synthesizing large-scale synthetic 2D video datasets, where each video contains consistent changes in the facial expression and viewpoint, combined with a variation in a specific facial attribute from the original input. We propose a novel pipeline to produce high-quality, photorealistic 2D videos with facial attribute editing. Leveraging this synthetic attribute dataset, we present a personalized avatar creation method based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting, learning a continuous and disentangled latent space for intuitive facial attribute manipulation. To enforce smooth transitions in this latent space, we introduce a latent space regularization technique by using interpolated 2D faces as supervision. Compared to previous approaches, we demonstrate that PERSE generates high-quality avatars with interpolated attributes while preserving identity of reference person.

- **Summary**: We introduce LTX-Video, a transformer-based latent diffusion model that adopts a holistic approach to video generation by seamlessly integrating the responsibilities of the Video-VAE and the denoising transformer. Unlike existing methods, which treat these components as independent, LTX-Video aims to optimize their interaction for improved efficiency and quality. At its core is a carefully designed Video-VAE that achieves a high compression ratio of 1:192, with spatiotemporal downscaling of 32 x 32 x 8 pixels per token, enabled by relocating the patchifying operation from the transformer's input to the VAE's input. Operating in this highly compressed latent space enables the transformer to efficiently perform full spatiotemporal self-attention, which is essential for generating high-resolution videos with temporal consistency. However, the high compression inherently limits the representation of fine details. To address this, our VAE decoder is tasked with both latent-to-pixel conversion and the final denoising step, producing the clean result directly in pixel space. This approach preserves the ability to generate fine details without incurring the runtime cost of a separate upsampling module. Our model supports diverse use cases, including text-to-video and image-to-video generation, with both capabilities trained simultaneously. It achieves faster-than-real-time generation, producing 5 seconds of 24 fps video at 768x512 resolution in just 2 seconds on an Nvidia H100 GPU, outperforming all existing models of similar scale. The source code and pre-trained models are publicly available, setting a new benchmark for accessible and scalable video generation.

- **Summary**: Generating desired images conditioned on given text descriptions has received lots of attention. Recently, diffusion models and autoregressive models have demonstrated their outstanding expressivity and gradually replaced GAN as the favored architectures for text-to-image synthesis. However, they still face some obstacles: slow inference speed and expensive training costs. To achieve more powerful and faster text-to-image synthesis under complex scenes, we propose TIGER, a text-to-image GAN with pretrained representations. To be specific, we propose a vision-empowered discriminator and a high-capacity generator. (i) The vision-empowered discriminator absorbs the complex scene understanding ability and the domain generalization ability from pretrained vision models to enhance model performance. Unlike previous works, we explore stacking multiple pretrained models in our discriminator to collect multiple different representations. (ii) The high-capacity generator aims to achieve effective text-image fusion while increasing the model capacity. The high-capacity generator consists of multiple novel high-capacity fusion blocks (HFBlock). And the HFBlock contains several deep fusion modules and a global fusion module, which play different roles to benefit our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed TIGER both on standard and zero-shot text-to-image synthesis tasks. On the standard text-to-image synthesis task, TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, which obtain a new FID 5.48 (COCO) and 9.38 (CUB). On the zero-shot text-to-image synthesis task, we achieve comparable performance with fewer model parameters, smaller training data size and faster inference speed. Additionally, more experiments and analyses are conducted in the Supplementary Material.

- **Summary**: Diffusionmodels(DMs)havedemonstratedremarkableachievements in synthesizing images of high fidelity and diversity. However, the extensive computational requirements and slow generative speed of diffusion models have limited their widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose a novel post-training quantization for diffusion models (PQD), which is a time-aware optimization framework for diffusion models based on post-training quantization. The proposed framework optimizes the inference process by selecting representative samples and conducting time-aware calibration. Experimental results show that our proposed method is able to directly quantize full-precision diffusion models into 8-bit or 4-bit models while maintaining comparable performance in a training-free manner, achieving a few FID change on ImageNet for unconditional image generation. Our approach demonstrates compatibility and can also be applied to 512x512 text-guided image generation for the first time.

- **Summary**: One of the challenging tasks in the field of video understanding is extracting semantic content from video inputs. Most existing systems use language models to describe videos in natural language sentences, but this has several major shortcomings. Such systems can rely too heavily on the language model component and base their output on statistical regularities in natural language text rather than on the visual contents of the video. Additionally, natural language annotations cannot be readily processed by a computer, are difficult to evaluate with performance metrics and cannot be easily translated into a different natural language. In this paper, we propose a method to annotate videos with knowledge graphs, and so avoid these problems. Specifically, we propose a deep-learning-based model for this task that first predicts pairs of individuals and then the relations between them. Additionally, we propose an extension of our model for the inclusion of background knowledge in the construction of knowledge graphs.

- **Summary**: A minimalist vision system uses the smallest number of pixels needed to solve a vision task. While traditional cameras use a large grid of square pixels, a minimalist camera uses freeform pixels that can take on arbitrary shapes to increase their information content. We show that the hardware of a minimalist camera can be modeled as the first layer of a neural network, where the subsequent layers are used for inference. Training the network for any given task yields the shapes of the camera's freeform pixels, each of which is implemented using a photodetector and an optical mask. We have designed minimalist cameras for monitoring indoor spaces (with 8 pixels), measuring room lighting (with 8 pixels), and estimating traffic flow (with 8 pixels). The performance demonstrated by these systems is on par with a traditional camera with orders of magnitude more pixels. Minimalist vision has two major advantages. First, it naturally tends to preserve the privacy of individuals in the scene since the captured information is inadequate for extracting visual details. Second, since the number of measurements made by a minimalist camera is very small, we show that it can be fully self-powered, i.e., function without an external power supply or a battery.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction aims to estimate an entity's future path using its current position and historical movement data, benefiting fields like autonomous navigation, robotics, and human movement analytics. Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.
