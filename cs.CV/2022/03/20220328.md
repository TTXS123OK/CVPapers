- **Summary**: This paper proposes JiGAN, a GAN-based method for solving Jigsaw puzzles with eroded or missing borders. Missing borders is a common real-world situation, for example, when dealing with the reconstruction of broken artifacts or ruined frescoes. In this particular condition, the puzzle's pieces do not align perfectly due to the borders' gaps; in this situation, the patches' direct match is unfeasible due to the lack of color and line continuations. JiGAN, is a two-steps procedure that tackles this issue: first, we repair the eroded borders with a GAN-based image extension model and measure the alignment affinity between pieces; then, we solve the puzzle with the relaxation labeling algorithm to enforce consistency in pieces positioning, hence, reconstructing the puzzle. We test the method on a large dataset of small puzzles and on three commonly used benchmark datasets to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Mean Average Precision (mAP) is the primary evaluation measure for object detection. Although object detection has a broad range of applications, mAP evaluates detectors in terms of the performance of ranked instance retrieval. Such the assumption for the evaluation task does not suit some downstream tasks. To alleviate the gap between downstream tasks and the evaluation scenario, we propose Optimal Correction Cost (OC-cost), which assesses detection accuracy at image level. OC-cost computes the cost of correcting detections to ground truths as a measure of accuracy. The cost is obtained by solving an optimal transportation problem between the detections and the ground truths. Unlike mAP, OC-cost is designed to penalize false positive and false negative detections properly, and every image in a dataset is treated equally. Our experimental result validates that OC-cost has better agreement with human preference than a ranking-based measure, i.e., mAP for a single image. We also show that detectors' rankings by OC-cost are more consistent on different data splits than mAP. Our goal is not to replace mAP with OC-cost but provide an additional tool to evaluate detectors from another aspect. To help future researchers and developers choose a target measure, we provide a series of experiments to clarify how mAP and OC-cost differ.

- **Summary**: This paper propose a interactive 3D modeling method and corresponding system based on single or multiple uncalibrated images. The main feature of this method is that, according to the modeling habits of ordinary people, the 3D model of the target is reconstructed from coarse to fine images. On the basis of determining the approximate shape, the user adds or modify projection constraints and spatial constraints, and apply topology modification, gradually realize camera calibration, refine rough model, and finally complete the reconstruction of objects with arbitrary geometry and topology. During the interactive process, the geometric parameters and camera projection matrix are solved in real time, and the reconstruction results are displayed in a 3D window.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks can be unreliable in the real world especially when they heavily use spurious features for their predictions. Recently, Singla & Feizi (2022) introduced the Salient Imagenet dataset by annotating and localizing core and spurious features of ~52k samples from 232 classes of Imagenet. While this dataset is useful for evaluating the reliance of pretrained models on spurious features, its small size limits its usefulness for training models. In this work, we first introduce the Salient Imagenet-1M dataset with more than 1 million soft masks localizing core and spurious features for all 1000 Imagenet classes. Using this dataset, we first evaluate the reliance of several Imagenet pretrained models (42 total) on spurious features and observe that: (i) transformers are more sensitive to spurious features compared to Convnets, (ii) zero-shot CLIP transformers are highly susceptible to spurious features. Next, we introduce a new learning paradigm called Core Risk Minimization (CoRM) whose objective ensures that the model predicts a class using its core features. We evaluate different computational approaches for solving CoRM and achieve significantly higher (+12%) core accuracy (accuracy when non-core regions corrupted using noise) with no drop in clean accuracy compared to models trained via Empirical Risk Minimization.

- **Summary**: This paper probes intrinsic factors behind typical failure cases (e.g. spatial inconsistency and boundary confusion) produced by the existing state-of-the-art method in face parsing. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Decoupled Multi-task Learning with Cyclical Self-Regulation (DML-CSR) for face parsing. Specifically, DML-CSR designs a multi-task model which comprises face parsing, binary edge, and category edge detection. These tasks only share low-level encoder weights without high-level interactions between each other, enabling to decouple auxiliary modules from the whole network at the inference stage. To address spatial inconsistency, we develop a dynamic dual graph convolutional network to capture global contextual information without using any extra pooling operation. To handle boundary confusion in both single and multiple face scenarios, we exploit binary and category edge detection to jointly obtain generic geometric structure and fine-grained semantic clues of human faces. Besides, to prevent noisy labels from degrading model generalization during training, cyclical self-regulation is proposed to self-ensemble several model instances to get a new model and the resulting model then is used to self-distill subsequent models, through alternating iterations. Experiments show that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on the Helen, CelebAMask-HQ, and Lapa datasets.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a second order spatial compatibility (SC^2) measure based method for efficient and robust point cloud registration (PCR), called SC^2-PCR. Firstly, we propose a second order spatial compatibility (SC^2) measure to compute the similarity between correspondences. It considers the global compatibility instead of local consistency, allowing for more distinctive clustering between inliers and outliers at early stage. Based on this measure, our registration pipeline employs a global spectral technique to find some reliable seeds from the initial correspondences. Then we design a two-stage strategy to expand each seed to a consensus set based on the SC^2 measure matrix. Finally, we feed each consensus set to a weighted SVD algorithm to generate a candidate rigid transformation and select the best model as the final result. Our method can guarantee to find a certain number of outlier-free consensus sets using fewer samplings, making the model estimation more efficient and robust. In addition, the proposed SC^2 measure is general and can be easily plugged into deep learning based frameworks. Extensive experiments are carried out to investigate the performance of our method. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/ZhiChen902/SC2-PCR}.

- **Summary**: We present 3MASSIV, a multilingual, multimodal and multi-aspect, expertly-annotated dataset of diverse short videos extracted from short-video social media platform - Moj. 3MASSIV comprises of 50k short videos (20 seconds average duration) and 100K unlabeled videos in 11 different languages and captures popular short video trends like pranks, fails, romance, comedy expressed via unique audio-visual formats like self-shot videos, reaction videos, lip-synching, self-sung songs, etc. 3MASSIV presents an opportunity for multimodal and multilingual semantic understanding on these unique videos by annotating them for concepts, affective states, media types, and audio language. We present a thorough analysis of 3MASSIV and highlight the variety and unique aspects of our dataset compared to other contemporary popular datasets with strong baselines. We also show how the social media content in 3MASSIV is dynamic and temporal in nature, which can be used for semantic understanding tasks and cross-lingual analysis.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised pixel-level defective region segmentation is an important task in image-based anomaly detection for various industrial applications. The state-of-the-art methods have their own advantages and limitations: matrix-decomposition-based methods are robust to noise but lack complex background image modeling capability; representation-based methods are good at defective region localization but lack accuracy in defective region shape contour extraction; reconstruction-based methods detected defective region match well with the ground truth defective region shape contour but are noisy. To combine the best of both worlds, we present an unsupervised patch autoencoder based deep image decomposition (PAEDID) method for defective region segmentation. In the training stage, we learn the common background as a deep image prior by a patch autoencoder (PAE) network. In the inference stage, we formulate anomaly detection as an image decomposition problem with the deep image prior and domain-specific regularizations. By adopting the proposed approach, the defective regions in the image can be accurately extracted in an unsupervised fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the PAEDID method in simulation studies and an industrial dataset in the case study.

- **Summary**: Face representation in the wild is extremely hard due to the large scale face variations. To this end, some deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been developed to learn discriminative feature by designing properly margin-based losses, which perform well on easy samples but fail on hard samples. Based on this, some methods mainly adjust the weights of hard samples in training stage to improve the feature discrimination. However, these methods overlook the feature distribution property which may lead to better results since the miss-classified hard samples may be corrected by using the distribution metric. This paper proposes the hard samples guided optimal transport (OT) loss for deep face representation, OTFace for short. OTFace aims to enhance the performance of hard samples by introducing the feature distribution discrepancy while maintain the performance on easy samples. Specifically, we embrace triplet scheme to indicate hard sample groups in one mini-batch during training. OT is then used to characterize the distribution differences of features from the high level convolutional layer. Finally, we integrate the margin-based-softmax (e.g. ArcFace or AM-Softmax) and OT to guide deep CNN learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark databases. The quantitative results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed OTFace over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This paper is a technical report to share our experience and findings building a Korean and English bilingual multimodal model. While many of the multimodal datasets focus on English and multilingual multimodal research uses machine-translated texts, employing such machine-translated texts is limited to describing unique expressions, cultural information, and proper noun in languages other than English. In this work, we collect 1.1 billion image-text pairs (708 million Korean and 476 million English) and train a bilingual multimodal model named KELIP. We introduce simple yet effective training schemes, including MAE pre-training and multi-crop augmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a model trained with such training schemes shows competitive performance in both languages. Moreover, we discuss multimodal-related research questions: 1) strong augmentation-based methods can distract the model from learning proper multimodal relations; 2) training multimodal model without cross-lingual relation can learn the relation via visual semantics; 3) our bilingual KELIP can capture cultural differences of visual semantics for the same meaning of words; 4) a large-scale multimodal model can be used for multimodal feature analogy. We hope that this work will provide helpful experience and findings for future research. We provide an open-source pre-trained KELIP.

- **Summary**: Analysis of human affect plays a vital role in human-computer interaction (HCI) systems. Due to the difficulty in capturing large amounts of real-life data, most of the current methods have mainly focused on controlled environments, which limit their application scenarios. To tackle this problem, we propose our solution based on the ensemble learning method. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a classification task, and then train several expression classification models with different types of backbones--ResNet, EfficientNet and InceptionNet. After that, the outputs of several models are fused via model ensemble method to predict the final results. Moreover, we introduce the multi-fold ensemble method to train and ensemble several models with the same architecture but different data distributions to enhance the performance of our solution. We conduct many experiments on the AffWild2 dataset of the ABAW2022 Challenge, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.

- **Summary**: The spread of the Red Pal Weevil (RPW) has become an existential threat for palm trees around the world. In the Middle East, RPW is causing wide-spread damage to date palm Phoenix dactylifera L., having both agricultural impacts on the palm production and environmental impacts. Early detection of RPW is very challenging, especially at large scale. This research proposes a novel remote sensing approach to recognize and monitor red palm weevil in date palm trees, using a combination of vegetation indices, object detection and semantic segmentation techniques. The study area consists of date palm trees with three classes, including healthy palms, smallish palms and severely infected palms. This proposed method achieved a promising 0.947 F1 score on test data set. This work paves the way for deploying artificial intelligence approaches to monitor RPW in large-scale as well as provide guidance for practitioners.

- **Summary**: It is extremely challenging to create an animatable clothed human avatar from RGB videos, especially for loose clothes due to the difficulties in motion modeling. To address this problem, we introduce a novel representation on the basis of recent neural scene rendering techniques. The core of our representation is a set of structured local radiance fields, which are anchored to the pre-defined nodes sampled on a statistical human body template. These local radiance fields not only leverage the flexibility of implicit representation in shape and appearance modeling, but also factorize cloth deformations into skeleton motions, node residual translations and the dynamic detail variations inside each individual radiance field. To learn our representation from RGB data and facilitate pose generalization, we propose to learn the node translations and the detail variations in a conditional generative latent space. Overall, our method enables automatic construction of animatable human avatars for various types of clothes without the need for scanning subject-specific templates, and can generate realistic images with dynamic details for novel poses. Experiment show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has shown impressive performance in semantic segmentation, but it is still unaffordable for resource-constrained mobile devices. While offloading computation tasks is promising, the high traffic demands overwhelm the limited bandwidth. Existing compression algorithms are not fit for semantic segmentation, as the lack of obvious and concentrated regions of interest (RoIs) forces the adoption of uniform compression strategies, leading to low compression ratios or accuracy. This paper introduces STAC, a DNN-driven compression scheme tailored for edge-assisted semantic video segmentation. STAC is the first to exploit DNN's gradients as spatial sensitivity metrics for spatial adaptive compression and achieves superior compression ratio and accuracy. Yet, it is challenging to adapt this content-customized compression to videos. Practical issues include varying spatial sensitivity and huge bandwidth consumption for compression strategy feedback and offloading. We tackle these issues through a spatiotemporal adaptive scheme, which (1) takes partial strategy generation operations offline to reduce communication load, and (2) propagates compression strategies and segmentation results across frames through dense optical flow, and adaptively offloads keyframes to accommodate video content. We implement STAC on a commodity mobile device. Experiments show that STAC can save up to 20.95% of bandwidth without losing accuracy, compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm.

- **Summary**: Multiple studies have demonstrated that obtaining standardized fetal brain biometry from mid-trimester ultrasonography (USG) examination is key for the reliable assessment of fetal neurodevelopment and the screening of central nervous system (CNS) anomalies. Obtaining these measurements is highly subjective, expertise-driven, and requires years of training experience, limiting quality prenatal care for all pregnant mothers. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) approach to compute 3 key fetal brain biometry from the 2D USG images of the transcerebellar plane (TC) through the accurate and automated caliper placement (2 per biometry) by modeling it as a landmark detection problem. We leveraged clinically relevant biometric constraints (relationship between caliper points) and domain-relevant data augmentation to improve the accuracy of a U-Net DL model (trained/tested on: 596 images, 473 subjects/143 images, 143 subjects). We performed multiple experiments demonstrating the effect of the DL backbone, data augmentation, generalizability and benchmarked against a recent state-of-the-art approach through extensive clinical validation (DL vs. 7 experienced clinicians). For all cases, the mean errors in the placement of the individual caliper points and the computed biometry were comparable to error rates among clinicians. The clinical translation of the proposed framework can assist novice users from low-resource settings in the reliable and standardized assessment of fetal brain sonograms.

- **Summary**: An optimization method is proposed in this paper for novel deployment of given number of directional landmarks (location and pose) within a given region in the 3-D task space. This new deployment technique is built on the geometric models of both landmarks and the monocular camera. In particular, a new concept of Multiple Coverage Probability (MCP) is defined to characterize the probability of at least n landmarks being covered simultaneously by a camera at a fixed position. The optimization is conducted with respect to the position and pose of the given number of landmarks to maximize MCP through globally exploration of the given 3-D space. By adopting the elimination genetic algorithm, the global optimal solutions can be obtained, which are then applied to improve the convergent performance of the visual observer on SE(3) as a demonstration example. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed landmark deployment optimization method.

- **Summary**: Equivariance has been a long-standing concern in various fields ranging from computer vision to physical modeling. Most previous methods struggle with generality, simplicity, and expressiveness -- some are designed ad hoc for specific data types, some are too complex to be accessible, and some sacrifice flexible transformations. In this work, we propose a novel and simple framework to achieve equivariance for point cloud analysis based on the message passing (graph neural network) scheme. We find the equivariant property could be obtained by introducing an orientation for each point to decouple the relative position for each point from the global pose of the entire point cloud. Therefore, we extend current message passing networks with a module that learns orientations for each point. Before aggregating information from the neighbors of a point, the networks transforms the neighbors' coordinates based on the point's learned orientations. We provide formal proofs to show the equivariance of the proposed framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive on both point cloud analysis and physical modeling tasks.

- **Summary**: This paper is about the old Wahba problem in its more general form, which we call "simultaneous rotation and correspondence search". In this generalization we need to find a rotation that best aligns two partially overlapping $3$D point sets, of sizes $m$ and $n$ respectively with $m\geq n$. We first propose a solver, $\texttt{ARCS}$, that i) assumes noiseless point sets in general position, ii) requires only $2$ inliers, iii) uses $O(m\log m)$ time and $O(m)$ space, and iv) can successfully solve the problem even with, e.g., $m,n\approx 10^6$ in about $0.1$ seconds. We next robustify $\texttt{ARCS}$ to noise, for which we approximately solve consensus maximization problems using ideas from robust subspace learning and interval stabbing. Thirdly, we refine the approximately found consensus set by a Riemannian subgradient descent approach over the space of unit quaternions, which we show converges globally to an $\varepsilon$-stationary point in $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$ iterations, or locally to the ground-truth at a linear rate in the absence of noise. We combine these algorithms into $\texttt{ARCS+}$, to simultaneously search for rotations and correspondences. Experiments show that $\texttt{ARCS+}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets with more than $10^6$ points with a $10^4$ time-speedup over alternative methods. \url{https://github.com/liangzu/ARCS}

- **Summary**: One of the training strategies of generative models is to minimize the Jensen--Shannon divergence between the model distribution and the data distribution. Since data distribution is unknown, generative adversarial networks (GANs) formulate this problem as a game between two models, a generator and a discriminator. The training can be formulated in the context of game theory and the local Nash equilibrium (LNE). It does not seem feasible to derive guarantees of stability or optimality for the existing methods. This optimization problem is far more challenging than the single objective setting. Here, we use the conjugate gradient method to reliably and efficiently solve the LNE problem in GANs. We give a proof and convergence analysis under mild assumptions showing that the proposed method converges to a LNE with three different learning rate update rules, including a constant learning rate. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and momentum SGD in terms of best Frechet inception distance (FID) score and outperforms Adam on average.

- **Summary**: Novel object captioning aims at describing objects absent from training data, with the key ingredient being the provision of object vocabulary to the model. Although existing methods heavily rely on an object detection model, we view the detection step as vocabulary retrieval from an external knowledge in the form of embeddings for any object's definition from Wiktionary, where we use in the retrieval image region features learned from a transformers model. We propose an end-to-end Novel Object Captioning with Retrieved vocabulary from External Knowledge method (NOC-REK), which simultaneously learns vocabulary retrieval and caption generation, successfully describing novel objects outside of the training dataset. Furthermore, our model eliminates the requirement for model retraining by simply updating the external knowledge whenever a novel object appears. Our comprehensive experiments on held-out COCO and Nocaps datasets show that our NOC-REK is considerably effective against SOTAs.

- **Summary**: Despite most existing anomaly detection studies assume the availability of normal training samples only, a few labeled anomaly examples are often available in many real-world applications, such as defect samples identified during random quality inspection, lesion images confirmed by radiologists in daily medical screening, etc. These anomaly examples provide valuable knowledge about the application-specific abnormality, enabling significantly improved detection of similar anomalies in some recent models. However, those anomalies seen during training often do not illustrate every possible class of anomaly, rendering these models ineffective in generalizing to unseen anomaly classes. This paper tackles open-set supervised anomaly detection, in which we learn detection models using the anomaly examples with the objective to detect both seen anomalies (`gray swans') and unseen anomalies (`black swans'). We propose a novel approach that learns disentangled representations of abnormalities illustrated by seen anomalies, pseudo anomalies, and latent residual anomalies (i.e., samples that have unusual residuals compared to the normal data in a latent space), with the last two abnormalities designed to detect unseen anomalies. Extensive experiments on nine real-world anomaly detection datasets show superior performance of our model in detecting seen and unseen anomalies under diverse settings.

- **Summary**: 3D point cloud segmentation has made tremendous progress in recent years. Most current methods focus on aggregating local features, but fail to directly model long-range dependencies. In this paper, we propose Stratified Transformer that is able to capture long-range contexts and demonstrates strong generalization ability and high performance. Specifically, we first put forward a novel key sampling strategy. For each query point, we sample nearby points densely and distant points sparsely as its keys in a stratified way, which enables the model to enlarge the effective receptive field and enjoy long-range contexts at a low computational cost. Also, to combat the challenges posed by irregular point arrangements, we propose first-layer point embedding to aggregate local information, which facilitates convergence and boosts performance. Besides, we adopt contextual relative position encoding to adaptively capture position information. Finally, a memory-efficient implementation is introduced to overcome the issue of varying point numbers in each window. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method on S3DIS, ScanNetv2 and ShapeNetPart datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision Transformers (ViTs) have come with a voracious appetite for computing power, high-lighting the urgent need to develop efficient training methods for ViTs. Progressive learning, a training scheme where the model capacity grows progressively during training, has started showing its ability in efficient training. In this paper, we take a practical step towards efficient training of ViTs by customizing and automating progressive learning. First, we develop a strong manual baseline for progressive learning of ViTs, by introducing momentum growth (MoGrow) to bridge the gap brought by model growth. Then, we propose automated progressive learning (AutoProg), an efficient training scheme that aims to achieve lossless acceleration by automatically increasing the training overload on-the-fly; this is achieved by adaptively deciding whether, where and how much should the model grow during progressive learning. Specifically, we first relax the optimization of the growth schedule to sub-network architecture optimization problem, then propose one-shot estimation of the sub-network performance via an elastic supernet. The searching overhead is reduced to minimal by recycling the parameters of the supernet. Extensive experiments of efficient training on ImageNet with two representative ViT models, DeiT and VOLO, demonstrate that AutoProg can accelerate ViTs training by up to 85.1% with no performance drop.

- **Summary**: Precise representations of 3D faces are beneficial to various computer vision and graphics applications. Due to the data discretization and model linearity, however, it remains challenging to capture accurate identity and expression clues in current studies. This paper presents a novel 3D morphable face model, namely ImFace, to learn a nonlinear and continuous space with implicit neural representations. It builds two explicitly disentangled deformation fields to model complex shapes associated with identities and expressions, respectively, and designs an improved learning strategy to extend embeddings of expressions to allow more diverse changes. We further introduce a Neural Blend-Field to learn sophisticated details by adaptively blending a series of local fields. In addition to ImFace, an effective preprocessing pipeline is proposed to address the issue of watertight input requirement in implicit representations, enabling them to work with common facial surfaces for the first time. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the superiority of ImFace.

- **Summary**: While the recent advances in research on video reenactment have yielded promising results, the approaches fall short in capturing the fine, detailed, and expressive facial features (e.g., lip-pressing, mouth puckering, mouth gaping, and wrinkles) which are crucial in generating realistic animated face videos. To this end, we propose an end-to-end expressive face video encoding approach that facilitates data-efficient high-quality video re-synthesis by optimizing low-dimensional edits of a single Identity-latent. The approach builds on StyleGAN2 image inversion and multi-stage non-linear latent-space editing to generate videos that are nearly comparable to input videos. While existing StyleGAN latent-based editing techniques focus on simply generating plausible edits of static images, we automate the latent-space editing to capture the fine expressive facial deformations in a sequence of frames using an encoding that resides in the Style-latent-space (StyleSpace) of StyleGAN2. The encoding thus obtained could be super-imposed on a single Identity-latent to facilitate re-enactment of face videos at $1024^2$. The proposed framework economically captures face identity, head-pose, and complex expressive facial motions at fine levels, and thereby bypasses training, person modeling, dependence on landmarks/ keypoints, and low-resolution synthesis which tend to hamper most re-enactment approaches. The approach is designed with maximum data efficiency, where a single $W+$ latent and 35 parameters per frame enable high-fidelity video rendering. This pipeline can also be used for puppeteering (i.e., motion transfer).

- **Summary**: Despite recent success in incorporating learning into point cloud registration, many works focus on learning feature descriptors and continue to rely on nearest-neighbor feature matching and outlier filtering through RANSAC to obtain the final set of correspondences for pose estimation. In this work, we conjecture that attention mechanisms can replace the role of explicit feature matching and RANSAC, and thus propose an end-to-end framework to directly predict the final set of correspondences. We use a network architecture consisting primarily of transformer layers containing self and cross attentions, and train it to predict the probability each point lies in the overlapping region and its corresponding position in the other point cloud. The required rigid transformation can then be estimated directly from the predicted correspondences without further post-processing. Despite its simplicity, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3DMatch and ModelNet benchmarks. Our source code can be found at https://github.com/yewzijian/RegTR .

- **Summary**: 3D medical image segmentation methods have been successful, but their dependence on large amounts of voxel-level annotated data is a disadvantage that needs to be addressed given the high cost to obtain such annotation. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) solve this issue by training models with a large unlabelled and a small labelled dataset. The most successful SSL approaches are based on consistency learning that minimises the distance between model responses obtained from perturbed views of the unlabelled data. These perturbations usually keep the spatial input context between views fairly consistent, which may cause the model to learn segmentation patterns from the spatial input contexts instead of the segmented objects. In this paper, we introduce the Translation Consistent Co-training (TraCoCo) which is a consistency learning SSL method that perturbs the input data views by varying their spatial input context, allowing the model to learn segmentation patterns from visual objects. Furthermore, we propose the replacement of the commonly used mean squared error (MSE) semi-supervised loss by a new Cross-model confident Binary Cross entropy (CBC) loss, which improves training convergence and keeps the robustness to co-training pseudo-labelling mistakes. We also extend CutMix augmentation to 3D SSL to further improve generalisation. Our TraCoCo shows state-of-the-art results for the Left Atrium (LA) and Brain Tumor Segmentation (BRaTS19) datasets with different backbones. Our code is available at https://github.com/yyliu01/TraCoCo.

- **Summary**: As RGB-D sensors become more affordable, using RGB-D images to obtain high-accuracy 6D pose estimation results becomes a better option. State-of-the-art approaches typically use different backbones to extract features for RGB and depth images. They use a 2D CNN for RGB images and a per-pixel point cloud network for depth data, as well as a fusion network for feature fusion. We find that the essential reason for using two independent backbones is the "projection breakdown" problem. In the depth image plane, the projected 3D structure of the physical world is preserved by the 1D depth value and its built-in 2D pixel coordinate (UV). Any spatial transformation that modifies UV, such as resize, flip, crop, or pooling operations in the CNN pipeline, breaks the binding between the pixel value and UV coordinate. As a consequence, the 3D structure is no longer preserved by a modified depth image or feature. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method denoted as Uni6D that explicitly takes the extra UV data along with RGB-D images as input. Our method has a Unified CNN framework for 6D pose estimation with a single CNN backbone. In particular, the architecture of our method is based on Mask R-CNN with two extra heads, one named RT head for directly predicting 6D pose and the other named abc head for guiding the network to map the visible points to their coordinates in the 3D model as an auxiliary module. This end-to-end approach balances simplicity and accuracy, achieving comparable accuracy with state of the arts and 7.2x faster inference speed on the YCB-Video dataset.

- **Summary**: The tremendous amount of accessible data in cyberspace face the risk of being unauthorized used for training deep learning models. To address this concern, methods are proposed to make data unlearnable for deep learning models by adding a type of error-minimizing noise. However, such conferred unlearnability is found fragile to adversarial training. In this paper, we design new methods to generate robust unlearnable examples that are protected from adversarial training. We first find that the vanilla error-minimizing noise, which suppresses the informative knowledge of data via minimizing the corresponding training loss, could not effectively minimize the adversarial training loss. This explains the vulnerability of error-minimizing noise in adversarial training. Based on the observation, robust error-minimizing noise is then introduced to reduce the adversarial training loss. Experiments show that the unlearnability brought by robust error-minimizing noise can effectively protect data from adversarial training in various scenarios.

- **Summary**: We propose the first reference-based video super-resolution (RefVSR) approach that utilizes reference videos for high-fidelity results. We focus on RefVSR in a triple-camera setting, where we aim at super-resolving a low-resolution ultra-wide video utilizing wide-angle and telephoto videos. We introduce the first RefVSR network that recurrently aligns and propagates temporal reference features fused with features extracted from low-resolution frames. To facilitate the fusion and propagation of temporal reference features, we propose a propagative temporal fusion module. For learning and evaluation of our network, we present the first RefVSR dataset consisting of triplets of ultra-wide, wide-angle, and telephoto videos concurrently taken from triple cameras of a smartphone. We also propose a two-stage training strategy fully utilizing video triplets in the proposed dataset for real-world 4x video super-resolution. We extensively evaluate our method, and the result shows the state-of-the-art performance in 4x super-resolution.

- **Summary**: The unlabeled data are generally assumed to be normal data in detecting abnormal data via semisupervised learning. This assumption, however, causes inevitable detection error when distribution of unlabeled data is different from distribution of labeled normal dataset. To deal the problem caused by distribution gap between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithm using KL divergence (SAD-KL). The proposed SAD-KL is composed of two steps: (1) estimating KL divergence of probability density functions (PDFs) of the local outlier factors (LOFs) of the labeled normal data and the unlabeled data (2) estimating detection probability and threshold for detecting normal data in unlabeled data by using the KL divergence. We show that the PDFs of the LOFs follow Burr distribution and use them for detection. Once the threshold is computed, the SAD-KL runs iteratively until the labeling change rate is lower than the predefined threshold. Experiments results show that the SAD-KL shows superior detection probability over the existing algorithms even though it takes less learning time.

- **Summary**: Supervised deep learning methods require a large repository of annotated data; hence, label noise is inevitable. Training with such noisy data negatively impacts the generalization performance of deep neural networks. To combat label noise, recent state-of-the-art methods employ some sort of sample selection mechanism to select a possibly clean subset of data. Next, an off-the-shelf semi-supervised learning method is used for training where rejected samples are treated as unlabeled data. Our comprehensive analysis shows that current selection methods disproportionately select samples from easy (fast learnable) classes while rejecting those from relatively harder ones. This creates class imbalance in the selected clean set and in turn, deteriorates performance under high label noise. In this work, we propose UNICON, a simple yet effective sample selection method which is robust to high label noise. To address the disproportionate selection of easy and hard samples, we introduce a Jensen-Shannon divergence based uniform selection mechanism which does not require any probabilistic modeling and hyperparameter tuning. We complement our selection method with contrastive learning to further combat the memorization of noisy labels. Extensive experimentation on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of UNICON; we obtain an 11.4% improvement over the current state-of-the-art on CIFAR100 dataset with a 90% noise rate.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D vehicle localization is an important task in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System (CVIS), which is usually achieved by monocular 3D vehicle detection. However, depth information cannot be obtained directly by monocular cameras due to the inherent imaging mechanism, resulting in more challenging monocular 3D tasks. Most of the current monocular 3D vehicle detection methods leverage 2D detectors and additional geometric modules, which reduces the efficiency. In this paper, we propose a 3D vehicle localization network CenterLoc3D for roadside monocular cameras, which directly predicts centroid and eight vertexes in image space, and the dimension of 3D bounding boxes without 2D detectors. To improve the precision of 3D vehicle localization, we propose a weighted-fusion module and a loss with spatial constraints embedded in CenterLoc3D. Firstly, the transformation matrix between 2D image space and 3D world space is solved by camera calibration. Secondly, vehicle type, centroid, eight vertexes, and the dimension of 3D vehicle bounding boxes are obtained by CenterLoc3D. Finally, centroid in 3D world space can be obtained by camera calibration and CenterLoc3D for 3D vehicle localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of 3D vehicle localization for roadside monocular cameras. Hence, we also propose a benchmark for this application including a dataset (SVLD-3D), an annotation tool (LabelImg-3D), and evaluation metrics. Through experimental validation, the proposed method achieves high accuracy and real-time performance. (limited words, please see the article for more details)

- **Summary**: Video deblurring remains a challenging task due to various causes of blurring. Traditional methods have considered how to utilize neighboring frames by the single-scale alignment for restoration. However, they typically suffer from misalignment caused by severe blur. In this work, we aim to better utilize neighboring frames with high efficient feature alignment. We propose a Pyramid Feature Alignment Network (PFAN) for video deblurring. First, the multi-scale feature of blurry frames is extracted with the strategy of Structure-to-Detail Downsampling (SDD) before alignment. This downsampling strategy makes the edges sharper, which is helpful for alignment. Then we align the feature at each scale and reconstruct the image at the corresponding scale. This strategy effectively supervises the alignment at each scale, overcoming the problem of propagated errors from the above scales at the alignment stage. To better handle the challenges of complex and large motions, instead of aligning features at each scale separately, lower-scale motion information is used to guide the higher-scale motion estimation. Accordingly, a Cascade Guided Deformable Alignment (CGDA) is proposed to integrate coarse motion into deformable convolution for finer and more accurate alignment. As demonstrated in extensive experiments, our proposed PFAN achieves superior performance with competitive speed compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Visual (image, video) quality assessments can be modelled by visual features in different domains, e.g., spatial, frequency, and temporal domains. Perceptual mechanisms in the human visual system (HVS) play a crucial role in generation of quality perception. This paper proposes a general framework for no-reference visual quality assessment using efficient windowed transformer architectures. A lightweight module for multi-stage channel attention is integrated into Swin (shifted window) Transformer. Such module can represent appropriate perceptual mechanisms in image quality assessment (IQA) to build an accurate IQA model. Meanwhile, representative features for image quality perception in the spatial and frequency domains can also be derived from the IQA model, which are then fed into another windowed transformer architecture for video quality assessment (VQA). The VQA model efficiently reuses attention information across local windows to tackle the issue of expensive time and memory complexities of original transformer. Experimental results on both large-scale IQA and VQA databases demonstrate that the proposed quality assessment models outperform other state-of-the-art models by large margins.

- **Summary**: Hands are often severely occluded by objects, which makes 3D hand mesh estimation challenging. Previous works often have disregarded information at occluded regions. However, we argue that occluded regions have strong correlations with hands so that they can provide highly beneficial information for complete 3D hand mesh estimation. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel 3D hand mesh estimation network HandOccNet, that can fully exploits the information at occluded regions as a secondary means to enhance image features and make it much richer. To this end, we design two successive Transformer-based modules, called feature injecting transformer (FIT) and self- enhancing transformer (SET). FIT injects hand information into occluded region by considering their correlation. SET refines the output of FIT by using a self-attention mechanism. By injecting the hand information to the occluded region, our HandOccNet reaches the state-of-the-art performance on 3D hand mesh benchmarks that contain challenging hand-object occlusions. The codes are available in: https://github.com/namepllet/HandOccNet.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptation (DA) or domain generalization (DG) for face presentation attack detection (PAD) has attracted attention recently with its robustness against unseen attack scenarios. Existing DA/DG-based PAD methods, however, have not yet fully explored the domain-specific style information that can provide knowledge regarding attack styles (e.g., materials, background, illumination and resolution). In this paper, we introduce a novel Style-Guided Domain Adaptation (SGDA) framework for inference-time adaptive PAD. Specifically, Style-Selective Normalization (SSN) is proposed to explore the domain-specific style information within the high-order feature statistics. The proposed SSN enables the adaptation of the model to the target domain by reducing the style difference between the target and the source domains. Moreover, we carefully design Style-Aware Meta-Learning (SAML) to boost the adaptation ability, which simulates the inference-time adaptation with style selection process on virtual test domain. In contrast to previous domain adaptation approaches, our method does not require either additional auxiliary models (e.g., domain adaptors) or the unlabeled target domain during training, which makes our method more practical to PAD task. To verify our experiments, we utilize the public datasets: MSU-MFSD, CASIA-FASD, OULU-NPU and Idiap REPLAYATTACK. In most assessments, the result demonstrates a notable gap of performance compared to the conventional DA/DG-based PAD methods.

- **Summary**: Combining the respective advantages of cross-modality images can compensate for the lack of information in the single modality, which has attracted increasing attention of researchers into multi-modal image matching tasks. Meanwhile, due to the great appearance differences between cross-modality image pairs, it often fails to make the feature representations of correspondences as close as possible. In this letter, we design a cross-modality feature representation learning network, S2-Net, which is based on the recently successful detect-and-describe pipeline, originally proposed for visible images but adapted to work with cross-modality image pairs. To solve the consequent problem of optimization difficulties, we introduce self-supervised learning with a well-designed loss function to guide the training without discarding the original advantages. This novel strategy simulates image pairs in the same modality, which is also a useful guide for the training of cross-modality images. Notably, it does not require additional data but significantly improves the performance and is even workable for all methods of the detect-and-describe pipeline. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the strategy we proposed, compared to both handcrafted and deep learning-based methods. Results show that our elegant formulation of combined optimization of supervised and self-supervised learning outperforms state-of-the-arts on RoadScene and RGB-NIR datasets.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse fields. However, it has been demonstrated that DNNs are very vulnerable to adversarial examples even in black-box settings. A large number of black-box attack methods have been proposed to in the literature. However, those methods usually suffer from low success rates and large query counts, which cannot fully satisfy practical purposes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid attack method which trains meta adversarial perturbations (MAPs) on surrogate models and performs black-box attacks by estimating gradients of the models. Our method uses the meta adversarial perturbation as an initialization and subsequently trains any black-box attack method for several epochs. Furthermore, the MAPs enjoy favorable transferability and universality, in the sense that they can be employed to boost performance of other black-box adversarial attack methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can not only improve the attack success rates, but also reduces the number of queries compared to other methods.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods provide significant assistance in analyzing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in chest computed tomography (CT) images, including identification, severity assessment, and segmentation. Although the earlier developed methods address the lack of data and specific annotations, the current goal is to build a robust algorithm for clinical use, having a larger pool of available data. With the larger datasets, the domain shift problem arises, affecting the performance of methods on the unseen data. One of the critical sources of domain shift in CT images is the difference in reconstruction kernels used to generate images from the raw data (sinograms). In this paper, we show a decrease in the COVID-19 segmentation quality of the model trained on the smooth and tested on the sharp reconstruction kernels. Furthermore, we compare several domain adaptation approaches to tackle the problem, such as task-specific augmentation and unsupervised adversarial learning. Finally, we propose the unsupervised adaptation method, called F-Consistency, that outperforms the previous approaches. Our method exploits a set of unlabeled CT image pairs which differ only in reconstruction kernels within every pair. It enforces the similarity of the network hidden representations (feature maps) by minimizing mean squared error (MSE) between paired feature maps. We show our method achieving 0.64 Dice Score on the test dataset with unseen sharp kernels, compared to the 0.56 Dice Score of the baseline model. Moreover, F-Consistency scores 0.80 Dice Score between predictions on the paired images, which almost doubles the baseline score of 0.46 and surpasses the other methods. We also show F-Consistency to better generalize on the unseen kernels and without the specific semantic content, e.g., presence of the COVID-19 lesions.

- **Summary**: In this work, we explore the challenging task of generating 3D shapes from text. Beyond the existing works, we propose a new approach for text-guided 3D shape generation, capable of producing high-fidelity shapes with colors that match the given text description. This work has several technical contributions. First, we decouple the shape and color predictions for learning features in both texts and shapes, and propose the word-level spatial transformer to correlate word features from text with spatial features from shape. Also, we design a cyclic loss to encourage consistency between text and shape, and introduce the shape IMLE to diversify the generated shapes. Further, we extend the framework to enable text-guided shape manipulation. Extensive experiments on the largest existing text-shape benchmark manifest the superiority of this work. The code and the models are available at https://github.com/liuzhengzhe/Towards-Implicit Text-Guided-Shape-Generation.

- **Summary**: 6D object pose estimation networks are limited in their capability to scale to large numbers of object instances due to the close-set assumption and their reliance on high-fidelity object CAD models. In this work, we study a new open set problem; the few-shot 6D object poses estimation: estimating the 6D pose of an unknown object by a few support views without extra training. To tackle the problem, we point out the importance of fully exploring the appearance and geometric relationship between the given support views and query scene patches and propose a dense prototypes matching framework by extracting and matching dense RGBD prototypes with transformers. Moreover, we show that the priors from diverse appearances and shapes are crucial to the generalization capability under the problem setting and thus propose a large-scale RGBD photorealistic dataset (ShapeNet6D) for network pre-training. A simple and effective online texture blending approach is also introduced to eliminate the domain gap from the synthesis dataset, which enriches appearance diversity at a low cost. Finally, we discuss possible solutions to this problem and establish benchmarks on popular datasets to facilitate future research. The project page is at \url{https://fs6d.github.io/}.

- **Summary**: The primary objective of this study was to develop a method that allows accurate quantification of plantar soft tissue stiffness distribution and homogeneity. The secondary aim of this study is to investigate if the differences in soft tissue stiffness distribution and homogeneity can be detected between ulcerated and non-ulcerated foot. Novel measures of individual pixel stiffness, named as quantitative strainability (QS) and relative strainability (RS) were developed. SE data obtained from 39 (9 with active diabetic foot ulcers) patients with diabetic neuropathy. The patients with active diabetic foot ulcer had wound in parts of the foot other than the first metatarsal head and the heel where the elastography measures were conducted. RS was used to measure changes and gradients in the stiffness distribution of plantar soft tissues in participants with and without active diabetic foot ulcer. The plantar soft tissue homogeneity in superior-inferior direction in the left forefoot was significantly (p<0.05) higher in ulcerated group compared to non-ulcerated group. The assessment of homogeneity showed potentials to further explain the nature of the change in tissue that can increase internal stress . This can have implications in assessing the vulnerability to soft tissue damage and ulceration in diabetes.

- **Summary**: Computationally expensive neural networks are ubiquitous in computer vision and solutions for efficient inference have drawn a growing attention in the machine learning community. Examples of such solutions comprise quantization, i.e. converting the processing values (weights and inputs) from floating point into integers e.g. int8 or int4. Concurrently, the rise of privacy concerns motivated the study of less invasive acceleration methods, such as data-free quantization of pre-trained models weights and activations. Previous approaches either exploit statistical information to deduce scalar ranges and scaling factors for the activations in a static manner, or dynamically adapt this range on-the-fly for each input of each layers (also referred to as activations): the latter generally being more accurate at the expanse of significantly slower inference. In this work, we argue that static input quantization can reach the accuracy levels of dynamic methods by means of a per-channel input quantization scheme that allows one to more finely preserve cross-channel dynamics. We show through a thorough empirical evaluation on multiple computer vision problems (e.g. ImageNet classification, Pascal VOC object detection as well as CityScapes semantic segmentation) that the proposed method, dubbed SPIQ, achieves accuracies rivalling dynamic approaches with static-level inference speed, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art quantization methods on every benchmark.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are ubiquitous in computer vision and natural language processing, but suffer from high inference cost. This problem can be addressed by quantization, which consists in converting floating point operations into a lower bit-width format. With the growing concerns on privacy rights, we focus our efforts on data-free methods. However, such techniques suffer from their lack of adaptability to the target devices, as a hardware typically only support specific bit widths. Thus, to adapt to a variety of devices, a quantization method shall be flexible enough to find good accuracy v.s. speed trade-offs for every bit width and target device. To achieve this, we propose REx, a quantization method that leverages residual error expansion, along with group sparsity and an ensemble approximation for better parallelization. REx is backed off by strong theoretical guarantees and achieves superior performance on every benchmarked application (from vision to NLP tasks), architecture (ConvNets, transformers) and bit-width (from int8 to ternary quantization).

- **Summary**: Batch-Normalization (BN) layers have become fundamental components in the evermore complex deep neural network architectures. Such models require acceleration processes for deployment on edge devices. However, BN layers add computation bottlenecks due to the sequential operation processing: thus, a key, yet often overlooked component of the acceleration process is BN layers folding. In this paper, we demonstrate that the current BN folding approaches are suboptimal in terms of how many layers can be removed. We therefore provide a necessary and sufficient condition for BN folding and a corresponding optimal algorithm. The proposed approach systematically outperforms existing baselines and allows to dramatically reduce the inference time of deep neural networks.

- **Summary**: This paper studies the 3D instance segmentation problem, which has a variety of real-world applications such as robotics and augmented reality. Since the surroundings of 3D objects are of high complexity, the separating of different objects is very difficult. To address this challenging problem, we propose a novel framework to group and refine the 3D instances. In practice, we first learn an offset vector for each point and shift it to its predicted instance center. To better group these points, we propose a Hierarchical Point Grouping algorithm to merge the centrally aggregated points progressively. All points are grouped into small clusters, which further gradually undergo another clustering procedure to merge into larger groups. These multi-scale groups are exploited for instance prediction, which is beneficial for predicting instances with different scales. In addition, a novel MaskScoreNet is developed to produce binary point masks of these groups for further refining the segmentation results. Extensive experiments conducted on the ScanNetV2 and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For instance, our approach achieves a 66.4\% mAP with the 0.5 IoU threshold on the ScanNetV2 test set, which is 1.9\% higher than the state-of-the-art method.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) fuses collaborative models from local nodes without centralizing users' data. The permutation invariance property of neural networks and the non-i.i.d. data across clients make the locally updated parameters imprecisely aligned, disabling the coordinate-based parameter averaging. Traditional neurons do not explicitly consider position information. Hence, we propose Position-Aware Neurons (PANs) as an alternative, fusing position-related values (i.e., position encodings) into neuron outputs. PANs couple themselves to their positions and minimize the possibility of dislocation, even updating on heterogeneous data. We turn on/off PANs to disable/enable the permutation invariance property of neural networks. PANs are tightly coupled with positions when applied to FL, making parameters across clients pre-aligned and facilitating coordinate-based parameter averaging. PANs are algorithm-agnostic and could universally improve existing FL algorithms. Furthermore, "FL with PANs" is simple to implement and computationally friendly.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of generating a 360-degree image from a single image with a narrow field of view by estimating its surroundings. Previous methods suffered from overfitting to the training resolution and deterministic generation. This paper proposes a completion method using a transformer for scene modeling and novel methods to improve the properties of a 360-degree image on the output image. Specifically, we use CompletionNets with a transformer to perform diverse completions and AdjustmentNet to match color, stitching, and resolution with an input image, enabling inference at any resolution. To improve the properties of a 360-degree image on an output image, we also propose WS-perceptual loss and circular inference. Thorough experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. For example, compared to SOTA methods, our method completes images 16 times larger in resolution and achieves 1.7 times lower Frechet inception distance (FID). Furthermore, we propose a pipeline that uses the completion results for lighting and background of 3DCG scenes. Our plausible background completion enables perceptually natural results in the application of inserting virtual objects with specular surfaces.

- **Summary**: Due to their outstanding properties in challenging conditions, event cameras have become indispensable in a wide range of applications, ranging from automotive, computational photography, and SLAM. However, as further improvements are made to the sensor design, modern event cameras are trending toward higher and higher sensor resolutions, which result in higher bandwidth and computational requirements on downstream tasks. Despite this trend, the benefits of using high-resolution event cameras to solve standard computer vision tasks are still not clear. In this work, we report the surprising discovery that, in low-illumination conditions and at high speeds, low-resolution cameras can outperform high-resolution ones, while requiring a significantly lower bandwidth. We provide both empirical and theoretical evidence for this claim, which indicates that high-resolution event cameras exhibit higher per-pixel event rates, leading to higher temporal noise in low-illumination conditions and at high speeds. As a result, in most cases, high-resolution event cameras show a lower task performance, compared to lower resolution sensors in these conditions. We empirically validate our findings across several tasks, namely image reconstruction, optical flow estimation, and camera pose tracking, both on synthetic and real data. We believe that these findings will provide important guidelines for future trends in event camera development.

- **Summary**: Crop maps are crucial for agricultural monitoring and food management and can additionally support domain-specific applications, such as setting cold supply chain infrastructure in developing countries. Machine learning (ML) models, combined with freely-available satellite imagery, can be used to produce cost-effective and high spatial-resolution crop maps. However, accessing ground truth data for supervised learning is especially challenging in developing countries due to factors such as smallholding and fragmented geography, which often results in a lack of crop type maps or even reliable cropland maps. Our area of interest for this study lies in Himachal Pradesh, India, where we aim at producing an open-access binary cropland map at 10-meter resolution for the Kullu, Shimla, and Mandi districts. To this end, we developed an ML pipeline that relies on Sentinel-2 satellite images time series. We investigated two pixel-based supervised classifiers, support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF), which are used to classify per-pixel time series for binary cropland mapping. The ground truth data used for training, validation and testing was manually annotated from a combination of field survey reference points and visual interpretation of very high resolution (VHR) imagery. We trained and validated the models via spatial cross-validation to account for local spatial autocorrelation and selected the RF model due to overall robustness and lower computational cost. We tested the generalization capability of the chosen model at the pixel level by computing the accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score on hold-out test sets of each district, achieving an average accuracy for the RF (our best model) of 87%. We used this model to generate a cropland map for three districts of Himachal Pradesh, spanning 14,600 km2, which improves the resolution and quality of existing public maps.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) aims at learning discriminative representations for person retrieval from unlabeled data. Recent techniques accomplish this task by using pseudo-labels, but these labels are inherently noisy and deteriorate the accuracy. To overcome this problem, several pseudo-label refinement methods have been proposed, but they neglect the fine-grained local context essential for person re-ID. In this paper, we propose a novel Part-based Pseudo Label Refinement (PPLR) framework that reduces the label noise by employing the complementary relationship between global and part features. Specifically, we design a cross agreement score as the similarity of k-nearest neighbors between feature spaces to exploit the reliable complementary relationship. Based on the cross agreement, we refine pseudo-labels of global features by ensembling the predictions of part features, which collectively alleviate the noise in global feature clustering. We further refine pseudo-labels of part features by applying label smoothing according to the suitability of given labels for each part. Thanks to the reliable complementary information provided by the cross agreement score, our PPLR effectively reduces the influence of noisy labels and learns discriminative representations with rich local contexts. Extensive experimental results on Market-1501 and MSMT17 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Recently, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) becomes the hotspot in the field of computer vision tasks. Without inductive bias, MLPs perform well on feature extraction and achieve amazing results. However, due to the simplicity of their structures, the performance highly depends on the local features communication machenism. To further improve the performance of MLP, we introduce information communication mechanisms from brain-inspired neural networks. Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is the most famous brain-inspired neural network, and achieve great success on dealing with sparse data. Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons in SNNs are used to communicate between different time steps. In this paper, we incorporate the machanism of LIF neurons into the MLP models, to achieve better accuracy without extra FLOPs. We propose a full-precision LIF operation to communicate between patches, including horizontal LIF and vertical LIF in different directions. We also propose to use group LIF to extract better local features. With LIF modules, our SNN-MLP model achieves 81.9%, 83.3% and 83.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset with only 4.4G, 8.5G and 15.2G FLOPs, respectively, which are state-of-the-art results as far as we know.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in image editing techniques have posed serious challenges to the trustworthiness of multimedia data, which drives the research of image tampering detection. In this paper, we propose ObjectFormer to detect and localize image manipulations. To capture subtle manipulation traces that are no longer visible in the RGB domain, we extract high-frequency features of the images and combine them with RGB features as multimodal patch embeddings. Additionally, we use a set of learnable object prototypes as mid-level representations to model the object-level consistencies among different regions, which are further used to refine patch embeddings to capture the patch-level consistencies. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art tampering detection and localization methods.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval typically asks for a trained model to be applied as is to unseen categories. In this paper, we question to argue that this setup by definition is not compatible with the inherent abstract and subjective nature of sketches, i.e., the model might transfer well to new categories, but will not understand sketches existing in different test-time distribution as a result. We thus extend ZS-SBIR asking it to transfer to both categories and sketch distributions. Our key contribution is a test-time training paradigm that can adapt using just one sketch. Since there is no paired photo, we make use of a sketch raster-vector reconstruction module as a self-supervised auxiliary task. To maintain the fidelity of the trained cross-modal joint embedding during test-time update, we design a novel meta-learning based training paradigm to learn a separation between model updates incurred by this auxiliary task from those off the primary objective of discriminative learning. Extensive experiments show our model to outperform state of-the-arts, thanks to the proposed test-time adaption that not only transfers to new categories but also accommodates to new sketching styles.

- **Summary**: The tensor network, as a facterization of tensors, aims at performing the operations that are common for normal tensors, such as addition, contraction and stacking. However, due to its non-unique network structure, only the tensor network contraction is so far well defined. In this paper, we propose a mathematically rigorous definition for the tensor network stack approach, that compress a large amount of tensor networks into a single one without changing their structures and configurations. We illustrate the main ideas with the matrix product states based machine learning as an example. Our results are compared with the for loop and the efficient coding method on both CPU and GPU.

- **Summary**: Existing motion capture datasets are largely short-range and cannot yet fit the need of long-range applications. We propose LiDARHuman26M, a new human motion capture dataset captured by LiDAR at a much longer range to overcome this limitation. Our dataset also includes the ground truth human motions acquired by the IMU system and the synchronous RGB images. We further present a strong baseline method, LiDARCap, for LiDAR point cloud human motion capture. Specifically, we first utilize PointNet++ to encode features of points and then employ the inverse kinematics solver and SMPL optimizer to regress the pose through aggregating the temporally encoded features hierarchically. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms the techniques based only on RGB images. Ablation experiments demonstrate that our dataset is challenging and worthy of further research. Finally, the experiments on the KITTI Dataset and the Waymo Open Dataset show that our method can be generalized to different LiDAR sensor settings.

- **Summary**: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is the task of identifying a set of <human, object, interaction> triplets from an image. Recent work proposed transformer encoder-decoder architectures that successfully eliminated the need for many hand-designed components in HOI detection through end-to-end training. However, they are limited to single-scale feature resolution, providing suboptimal performance in scenes containing humans, objects and their interactions with vastly different scales and distances. To tackle this problem, we propose a Multi-Scale TRansformer (MSTR) for HOI detection powered by two novel HOI-aware deformable attention modules called Dual-Entity attention and Entity-conditioned Context attention. While existing deformable attention comes at a huge cost in HOI detection performance, our proposed attention modules of MSTR learn to effectively attend to sampling points that are essential to identify interactions. In experiments, we achieve the new state-of-the-art performance on two HOI detection benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Assembly101 is a new procedural activity dataset featuring 4321 videos of people assembling and disassembling 101 "take-apart" toy vehicles. Participants work without fixed instructions, and the sequences feature rich and natural variations in action ordering, mistakes, and corrections. Assembly101 is the first multi-view action dataset, with simultaneous static (8) and egocentric (4) recordings. Sequences are annotated with more than 100K coarse and 1M fine-grained action segments, and 18M 3D hand poses. We benchmark on three action understanding tasks: recognition, anticipation and temporal segmentation. Additionally, we propose a novel task of detecting mistakes. The unique recording format and rich set of annotations allow us to investigate generalization to new toys, cross-view transfer, long-tailed distributions, and pose vs. appearance. We envision that Assembly101 will serve as a new challenge to investigate various activity understanding problems.

- **Summary**: 3D shape abstraction has drawn great interest over the years. Apart from low-level representations such as meshes and voxels, researchers also seek to semantically abstract complex objects with basic geometric primitives. Recent deep learning methods rely heavily on datasets, with limited generality to unseen categories. Furthermore, abstracting an object accurately yet with a small number of primitives still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric Bayesian statistical method to infer an abstraction, consisting of an unknown number of geometric primitives, from a point cloud. We model the generation of points as observations sampled from an infinite mixture of Gaussian Superquadric Taper Models (GSTM). Our approach formulates the abstraction as a clustering problem, in which: 1) each point is assigned to a cluster via the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP); 2) a primitive representation is optimized for each cluster, and 3) a merging post-process is incorporated to provide a concise representation. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets. The results indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and is generalizable to various types of objects.

- **Summary**: Simulation tools are essential for robotics research, especially for those domains in which safety is crucial, such as Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). However, it is challenging to simulate human behaviors, and existing robotics simulators do not integrate functional human models. This work presents Open-VICO, an open-source toolkit to integrate virtual human models in Gazebo focusing on vision-based human tracking. In particular, Open-VICO allows to combine in the same simulation environment realistic human kinematic models, multi-camera vision setups, and human-tracking techniques along with numerous robot and sensor models thanks to Gazebo. The possibility to incorporate pre-recorded human skeleton motion with Motion Capture systems broadens the landscape of human performance behavioral analysis within Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) settings. To describe the functionalities and stress the potential of the toolkit four specific examples, chosen among relevant literature challenges in the field, are developed using our simulation utils: i) 3D multi-RGB-D camera calibration in simulation, ii) creation of a synthetic human skeleton tracking dataset based on OpenPose, iii) multi-camera scenario for human skeleton tracking in simulation, and iv) a human-robot interaction example. The key of this work is to create a straightforward pipeline which we hope will motivate research on new vision-based algorithms and methodologies for lightweight human-tracking and flexible human-robot applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a pressure characterization and normalization procedure for online handwritten acquisition. Normalization process has been tested in biometric recognition experiments (identification and verification) using online signature database MCYT, which consists of the signatures from 330 users. The goal is to analyze the real mismatch scenarios where users are enrolled with one stylus and then, later on, they produce some testing samples using a different stylus model with different pressure response. Experimental results show: 1) a saturation behavior in pressure signal 2) different dynamic ranges in the different stylus studied 3) improved biometric recognition accuracy by means of pressure signal normalization as well as a performance degradation in mismatched conditions 4) interoperability between different stylus can be obtained by means of pressure normalization. Normalization produces an improvement in signature identification rates higher than 7% (absolute value) when compared with mismatched scenarios.

- **Summary**: Interventional magnetic resonance imaging (i-MRI) for surgical guidance could help visualize the interventional process such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), improving the surgery performance and patient outcome. Different from retrospective reconstruction in conventional dynamic imaging, i-MRI for DBS has to acquire and reconstruct the interventional images sequentially online. Here we proposed a convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) based recurrent neural network (RNN), or ConvLR, to reconstruct interventional images with golden-angle radial sampling. By using an initializer and Conv-LSTM blocks, the priors from the pre-operative reference image and intra-operative frames were exploited for reconstructing the current frame. Data consistency for radial sampling was implemented by a soft-projection method. To improve the reconstruction accuracy, an adversarial learning strategy was adopted. A set of interventional images based on the pre-operative and post-operative MR images were simulated for algorithm validation. Results showed with only 10 radial spokes, ConvLR provided the best performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, giving an acceleration up to 40 folds. The proposed algorithm has the potential to achieve real-time i-MRI for DBS and can be used for general purpose MR-guided intervention.

- **Summary**: Multimodal emotion recognition has recently gained much attention since it can leverage diverse and complementary relationships over multiple modalities (e.g., audio, visual, biosignals, etc.), and can provide some robustness to noisy modalities. Most state-of-the-art methods for audio-visual (A-V) fusion rely on recurrent networks or conventional attention mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the complementary nature of A-V modalities. In this paper, we focus on dimensional emotion recognition based on the fusion of facial and vocal modalities extracted from videos. Specifically, we propose a joint cross-attention model that relies on the complementary relationships to extract the salient features across A-V modalities, allowing for accurate prediction of continuous values of valence and arousal. The proposed fusion model efficiently leverages the inter-modal relationships, while reducing the heterogeneity between the features. In particular, it computes the cross-attention weights based on correlation between the combined feature representation and individual modalities. By deploying the combined A-V feature representation into the cross-attention module, the performance of our fusion module improves significantly over the vanilla cross-attention module. Experimental results on validation-set videos from the AffWild2 dataset indicate that our proposed A-V fusion model provides a cost-effective solution that can outperform state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: The use of deep learning has successfully solved several problems in the field of medical imaging. Deep learning has been applied to the CT denoising problem successfully. However, the use of deep learning requires large amounts of data to train deep convolutional networks (CNNs). Moreover, due to large parameter count, such deep CNNs may cause unexpected results. In this study, we introduce a novel CT denoising framework, which has interpretable behaviour, and provides useful results with limited data. We employ bilateral filtering in both the projection and volume domains to remove noise. To account for non-stationary noise, we tune the $\sigma$ parameters of the volume for every projection view, and for every volume pixel. The tuning is carried out by two deep CNNs. Due to impracticality of labelling, the two deep CNNs are trained via a Deep-Q reinforcement learning task. The reward for the task is generated by using a custom reward function represented by a neural network. Our experiments were carried out on abdominal scans for the Mayo Clinic TCIA dataset, and the AAPM Low Dose CT Grand Challenge. Our denoising framework has excellent denoising performance increasing the PSNR from 28.53 to 28.93, and increasing the SSIM from 0.8952 to 0.9204. We outperform several state-of-the-art deep CNNs, which have several orders of magnitude higher number of parameters (p-value (PSNR) = 0.000, p-value (SSIM) = 0.000). Our method does not introduce any blurring, which is introduced by MSE loss based methods, or any deep learning artifacts, which are introduced by WGAN based models. Our ablation studies show that parameter tuning and using our reward network results in the best possible results.

- **Summary**: Learning discriminative deep feature embeddings by using million-scale in-the-wild datasets and margin-based softmax loss is the current state-of-the-art approach for face recognition. However, the memory and computing cost of the Fully Connected (FC) layer linearly scales up to the number of identities in the training set. Besides, the large-scale training data inevitably suffers from inter-class conflict and long-tailed distribution. In this paper, we propose a sparsely updating variant of the FC layer, named Partial FC (PFC). In each iteration, positive class centers and a random subset of negative class centers are selected to compute the margin-based softmax loss. All class centers are still maintained throughout the whole training process, but only a subset is selected and updated in each iteration. Therefore, the computing requirement, the probability of inter-class conflict, and the frequency of passive update on tail class centers, are dramatically reduced. Extensive experiments across different training data and backbones (e.g. CNN and ViT) confirm the effectiveness, robustness and efficiency of the proposed PFC.

- **Summary**: We scrutinise an important observation plaguing scene-level sketch research -- that a significant portion of scene sketches are "partial". A quick pilot study reveals: (i) a scene sketch does not necessarily contain all objects in the corresponding photo, due to the subjective holistic interpretation of scenes, (ii) there exists significant empty (white) regions as a result of object-level abstraction, and as a result, (iii) existing scene-level fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval methods collapse as scene sketches become more partial. To solve this "partial" problem, we advocate for a simple set-based approach using optimal transport (OT) to model cross-modal region associativity in a partially-aware fashion. Importantly, we improve upon OT to further account for holistic partialness by comparing intra-modal adjacency matrices. Our proposed method is not only robust to partial scene-sketches but also yields state-of-the-art performance on existing datasets.

- **Summary**: Despite an increase in the empirical study of crowdfunding platforms and the prevalence of visual information, operations management and marketing literature has yet to explore the role that image characteristics play in crowdfunding success. The authors of this manuscript begin by synthesizing literature on visual processing to identify several image characteristics that are likely to shape crowdfunding success. After detailing measures for each image characteristic, they use them as part of a machine-learning algorithm (Bayesian additive trees), along with project characteristics and textual information, to predict crowdfunding success. Results show that the inclusion of these image characteristics substantially improves prediction over baseline project variables, as well as textual features. Furthermore, image characteristic variables exhibit high importance, similar to variables linked to the number of pictures and number of videos. This research therefore offers valuable resources to researchers and managers who are interested in the role of visual information in ensuring new product success.

- **Summary**: Precipitation is a key part of hydrological circulation and is a sensitive indicator of climate change. The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (IMERG) datasets are widely used for global and regional precipitation investigations. However, their local application is limited by the relatively coarse spatial resolution. Therefore, in this paper, an attention mechanism based convolutional network (AMCN) is proposed to downscale GPM IMERG monthly precipitation data. The proposed method is an end-to-end network, which consists of a global cross-attention module, a multi-factor cross-attention module, and a residual convolutional module, comprehensively considering the potential relationships between precipitation and complicated surface characteristics. In addition, a degradation loss function based on low-resolution precipitation is designed to physically constrain the network training, to improve the robustness of the proposed network under different time and scale variations. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed network significantly outperforms three baseline methods. Finally, a geographic difference analysis method is introduced to further improve the downscaled results by incorporating in-situ measurements for high-quality and fine-scale precipitation estimation.

- **Summary**: Sketching enables many exciting applications, notably, image retrieval. The fear-to-sketch problem (i.e., "I can't sketch") has however proven to be fatal for its widespread adoption. This paper tackles this "fear" head on, and for the first time, proposes an auxiliary module for existing retrieval models that predominantly lets the users sketch without having to worry. We first conducted a pilot study that revealed the secret lies in the existence of noisy strokes, but not so much of the "I can't sketch". We consequently design a stroke subset selector that {detects noisy strokes, leaving only those} which make a positive contribution towards successful retrieval. Our Reinforcement Learning based formulation quantifies the importance of each stroke present in a given subset, based on the extent to which that stroke contributes to retrieval. When combined with pre-trained retrieval models as a pre-processing module, we achieve a significant gain of 8%-10% over standard baselines and in turn report new state-of-the-art performance. Last but not least, we demonstrate the selector once trained, can also be used in a plug-and-play manner to empower various sketch applications in ways that were not previously possible.

- **Summary**: Reconstruction of high-quality HDR images is at the core of modern computational photography. Significant progress has been made with multi-frame HDR reconstruction methods, producing high-resolution, rich and accurate color reconstructions with high-frequency details. However, they are still prone to fail in dynamic or largely over-exposed scenes, where frame misalignment often results in visible ghosting artifacts. Recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by utilizing an event-based camera (EBC), which measures only binary changes of illuminations. Despite their desirable high temporal resolution and dynamic range characteristics, such approaches have not outperformed traditional multi-frame reconstruction methods, mainly due to the lack of color information and low-resolution sensors. In this paper, we propose to leverage both bracketed LDR images and simultaneously captured events to obtain the best of both worlds: high-quality RGB information from bracketed LDRs and complementary high frequency and dynamic range information from events. We present a multi-modal end-to-end learning-based HDR imaging system that fuses bracketed images and event modalities in the feature domain using attention and multi-scale spatial alignment modules. We propose a novel event-to-image feature distillation module that learns to translate event features into the image-feature space with self-supervision. Our framework exploits the higher temporal resolution of events by sub-sampling the input event streams using a sliding window, enriching our combined feature representation. Our proposed approach surpasses SoTA multi-frame HDR reconstruction methods using synthetic and real events, with a 2dB and 1dB improvement in PSNR-L and PSNR-mu on the HdM HDR dataset, respectively.

- **Summary**: Machine learning classifiers' capability is largely dependent on the scale of available training data and limited by the model overfitting in data-scarce learning tasks. To address this problem, this work proposes a novel framework of Meta Functional Learning (MFL) by meta-learning a generalisable functional model from data-rich tasks whilst simultaneously regularising knowledge transfer to data-scarce tasks. The MFL computes meta-knowledge on functional regularisation generalisable to different learning tasks by which functional training on limited labelled data promotes more discriminative functions to be learned. Based on this framework, we formulate three variants of MFL: MFL with Prototypes (MFL-P) which learns a functional by auxiliary prototypes, Composite MFL (ComMFL) that transfers knowledge from both functional space and representational space, and MFL with Iterative Updates (MFL-IU) which improves knowledge transfer regularisation from MFL by progressively learning the functional regularisation in knowledge transfer. Moreover, we generalise these variants for knowledge transfer regularisation from binary classifiers to multi-class classifiers. Extensive experiments on two few-shot learning scenarios, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL), show that meta functional learning for knowledge transfer regularisation can improve FSL classifiers.

- **Summary**: The human visual system is remarkable in learning new visual concepts from just a few examples. This is precisely the goal behind few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL), where the emphasis is additionally placed on ensuring the model does not suffer from "forgetting". In this paper, we push the boundary further for FSCIL by addressing two key questions that bottleneck its ubiquitous application (i) can the model learn from diverse modalities other than just photo (as humans do), and (ii) what if photos are not readily accessible (due to ethical and privacy constraints). Our key innovation lies in advocating the use of sketches as a new modality for class support. The product is a "Doodle It Yourself" (DIY) FSCIL framework where the users can freely sketch a few examples of a novel class for the model to learn to recognize photos of that class. For that, we present a framework that infuses (i) gradient consensus for domain invariant learning, (ii) knowledge distillation for preserving old class information, and (iii) graph attention networks for message passing between old and novel classes. We experimentally show that sketches are better class support than text in the context of FSCIL, echoing findings elsewhere in the sketching literature.



### WSEBP: A Novel Width-depth Synchronous Extension-based Basis Pursuit Algorithm for Multi-Layer Convolutional Sparse Coding

- **Summary**: The pursuit algorithms integrated in multi-layer convolutional sparse coding (ML-CSC) can interpret the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, many current state-of-art (SOTA) pursuit algorithms require multiple iterations to optimize the solution of ML-CSC, which limits their applications to deeper CNNs due to high computational cost and large number of resources for getting very tiny gain of performance. In this study, we focus on the 0th iteration in pursuit algorithm by introducing an effective initialization strategy for each layer, by which the solution for ML-CSC can be improved. Specifically, we first propose a novel width-depth synchronous extension-based basis pursuit (WSEBP) algorithm which solves the ML-CSC problem without the limitation of the number of iterations compared to the SOTA algorithms and maximizes the performance by an effective initialization in each layer. Then, we propose a simple and unified ML-CSC-based classification network (ML-CSC-Net) which consists of an ML-CSC-based feature encoder and a fully-connected layer to validate the performance of WSEBP on image classification task. The experimental results show that our proposed WSEBP outperforms SOTA algorithms in terms of accuracy and consumption resources. In addition, the WSEBP integrated in CNNs can improve the performance of deeper CNNs and make them interpretable. Finally, taking VGG as an example, we propose WSEBP-VGG13 to enhance the performance of VGG13, which achieves competitive results on four public datasets, i.e., 87.79% vs. 86.83% on Cifar-10 dataset, 58.01% vs. 54.60% on Cifar-100 dataset, 91.52% vs. 89.58% on COVID-19 dataset, and 99.88% vs. 99.78% on Crack dataset, respectively. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed WSEBP, the improved performance of ML-CSC with WSEBP, and interpretation of the CNNs or deeper CNNs.

- **Summary**: A promising direction for recovering the lost information in low-resolution headshot images is utilizing a set of high-resolution exemplars from the same identity. Complementary images in the reference set can improve the generated headshot quality across many different views and poses. However, it is challenging to make the best use of multiple exemplars: the quality and alignment of each exemplar cannot be guaranteed. Using low-quality and mismatched images as references will impair the output results. To overcome these issues, we propose an efficient Headshot Image Super-Resolution with Multiple Exemplars network (HIME) method. Compared with previous methods, our network can effectively handle the misalignment between the input and the reference without requiring facial priors and learn the aggregated reference set representation in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, to reconstruct more detailed facial features, we propose a correlation loss that provides a rich representation of the local texture in a controllable spatial range. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only has significantly fewer computation cost than recent exemplar-guided methods but also achieves better qualitative and quantitative performance.

- **Summary**: A high-performance unsupervised nuclei instance segmentation (HUNIS) method is proposed in this work. HUNIS consists of two-stage block-wise operations. The first stage includes: 1) adaptive thresholding of pixel intensities, 2) incorporation of nuclei size/shape priors and 3) removal of false positive nuclei instances. Then, HUNIS conducts the second stage segmentation by receiving guidance from the first one. The second stage exploits the segmentation masks obtained in the first stage and leverages color and shape distributions for a more accurate segmentation. The main purpose of the two-stage design is to provide pixel-wise pseudo-labels from the first to the second stage. This self-supervision mechanism is novel and effective. Experimental results on the MoNuSeg dataset show that HUNIS outperforms all other unsupervised methods by a substantial margin. It also has a competitive standing among state-of-the-art supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Despite the recent progress in deep learning, most approaches still go for a silo-like solution, focusing on learning each task in isolation: training a separate neural network for each individual task. Many real-world problems, however, call for a multi-modal approach and, therefore, for multi-tasking models. Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to leverage useful information across tasks to improve the generalization capability of a model. This thesis is concerned with multi-task learning in the context of computer vision. First, we review existing approaches for MTL. Next, we propose several methods that tackle important aspects of multi-task learning. The proposed methods are evaluated on various benchmarks. The results show several advances in the state-of-the-art of multi-task learning. Finally, we discuss several possibilities for future work.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has made enormous progress and largely narrowed the gap with the supervised ones, where the representation learning is mainly guided by a projection into an embedding space. During the projection, current methods simply adopt uniform aggregation of pixels for embedding; however, this risks involving object-irrelevant nuisances and spatial misalignment for different augmentations. In this paper, we present a new approach, Learning Where to Learn (LEWEL), to adaptively aggregate spatial information of features, so that the projected embeddings could be exactly aligned and thus guide the feature learning better. Concretely, we reinterpret the projection head in SSL as a per-pixel projection and predict a set of spatial alignment maps from the original features by this weight-sharing projection head. A spectrum of aligned embeddings is thus obtained by aggregating the features with spatial weighting according to these alignment maps. As a result of this adaptive alignment, we observe substantial improvements on both image-level prediction and dense prediction at the same time: LEWEL improves MoCov2 by 1.6%/1.3%/0.5%/0.4% points, improves BYOL by 1.3%/1.3%/0.7%/0.6% points, on ImageNet linear/semi-supervised classification, Pascal VOC semantic segmentation, and object detection, respectively.

- **Summary**: We propose a new method for constructing elimination templates for efficient polynomial system solving of minimal problems in structure from motion, image matching, and camera tracking. We first construct a particular affine parameterization of the elimination templates for systems with a finite number of distinct solutions. Then, we use a heuristic greedy optimization strategy over the space of parameters to get a template with a small size. We test our method on 34 minimal problems in computer vision. For all of them, we found the templates either of the same or smaller size compared to the state-of-the-art. For some difficult examples, our templates are, e.g., 2.1, 2.5, 3.8, 6.6 times smaller. For the problem of refractive absolute pose estimation with unknown focal length, we have found a template that is 20 times smaller. Our experiments on synthetic data also show that the new solvers are fast and numerically accurate. We also present a fast and numerically accurate solver for the problem of relative pose estimation with unknown common focal length and radial distortion.

- **Summary**: Modern object detectors have achieved impressive progress under the close-set setup. However, open-set object detection (OSOD) remains challenging since objects of unknown categories are often misclassified to existing known classes. In this work, we propose to identify unknown objects by separating high/low-density regions in the latent space, based on the consensus that unknown objects are usually distributed in low-density latent regions. As traditional threshold-based methods only maintain limited low-density regions, which cannot cover all unknown objects, we present a novel Open-set Detector (OpenDet) with expanded low-density regions. To this aim, we equip OpenDet with two learners, Contrastive Feature Learner (CFL) and Unknown Probability Learner (UPL). CFL performs instance-level contrastive learning to encourage compact features of known classes, leaving more low-density regions for unknown classes; UPL optimizes unknown probability based on the uncertainty of predictions, which further divides more low-density regions around the cluster of known classes. Thus, unknown objects in low-density regions can be easily identified with the learned unknown probability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the OSOD performance, e.g., OpenDet reduces the Absolute Open-Set Errors by 25%-35% on six OSOD benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The retinal vasculature provides important clues in the diagnosis and monitoring of systemic diseases including hypertension and diabetes. The microvascular system is of primary involvement in such conditions, and the retina is the only anatomical site where the microvasculature can be directly observed. The objective assessment of retinal vessels has long been considered a surrogate biomarker for systemic vascular diseases, and with recent advancements in retinal imaging and computer vision technologies, this topic has become the subject of renewed attention. In this paper, we present a novel dataset, dubbed RAVIR, for the semantic segmentation of Retinal Arteries and Veins in Infrared Reflectance (IR) imaging. It enables the creation of deep learning-based models that distinguish extracted vessel type without extensive post-processing. We propose a novel deep learning-based methodology, denoted as SegRAVIR, for the semantic segmentation of retinal arteries and veins and the quantitative measurement of the widths of segmented vessels. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of SegRAVIR and demonstrate its superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for the domain adaptation of RAVIR pretrained networks on color images. We demonstrate that our pretraining procedure yields new state-of-the-art benchmarks on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 datasets. Dataset link: https://ravirdataset.github.io/data/

- **Summary**: This paper proposes an attributable visual similarity learning (AVSL) framework for a more accurate and explainable similarity measure between images. Most existing similarity learning methods exacerbate the unexplainability by mapping each sample to a single point in the embedding space with a distance metric (e.g., Mahalanobis distance, Euclidean distance). Motivated by the human semantic similarity cognition, we propose a generalized similarity learning paradigm to represent the similarity between two images with a graph and then infer the overall similarity accordingly. Furthermore, we establish a bottom-up similarity construction and top-down similarity inference framework to infer the similarity based on semantic hierarchy consistency. We first identify unreliable higher-level similarity nodes and then correct them using the most coherent adjacent lower-level similarity nodes, which simultaneously preserve traces for similarity attribution. Extensive experiments on the CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing deep similarity learning methods and verify the interpretability of our framework. Code is available at https://github.com/zbr17/AVSL.

- **Summary**: Data privacy is a central problem for embodied agents that can perceive the environment, communicate with humans, and act in the real world. While helping humans complete tasks, the agent may observe and process sensitive information of users, such as house environments, human activities, etc. In this work, we introduce privacy-preserving embodied agent learning for the task of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), where an embodied agent navigates house environments by following natural language instructions. We view each house environment as a local client, which shares nothing other than local updates with the cloud server and other clients, and propose a novel federated vision-and-language navigation (FedVLN) framework to protect data privacy during both training and pre-exploration. Particularly, we propose a decentralized training strategy to limit the data of each client to its local model training and a federated pre-exploration method to do partial model aggregation to improve model generalizability to unseen environments. Extensive results on R2R and RxR datasets show that under our FedVLN framework, decentralized VLN models achieve comparable results with centralized training while protecting seen environment privacy, and federated pre-exploration significantly outperforms centralized pre-exploration while preserving unseen environment privacy.

- **Summary**: Recently, vision-language pre-training shows great potential in open-vocabulary object detection, where detectors trained on base classes are devised for detecting new classes. The class text embedding is firstly generated by feeding prompts to the text encoder of a pre-trained vision-language model. It is then used as the region classifier to supervise the training of a detector. The key element that leads to the success of this model is the proper prompt, which requires careful words tuning and ingenious design. To avoid laborious prompt engineering, there are some prompt representation learning methods being proposed for the image classification task, which however can only be sub-optimal solutions when applied to the detection task. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, detection prompt (DetPro), to learn continuous prompt representations for open-vocabulary object detection based on the pre-trained vision-language model. Different from the previous classification-oriented methods, DetPro has two highlights: 1) a background interpretation scheme to include the proposals in image background into the prompt training; 2) a context grading scheme to separate proposals in image foreground for tailored prompt training. We assemble DetPro with ViLD, a recent state-of-the-art open-world object detector, and conduct experiments on the LVIS as well as transfer learning on the Pascal VOC, COCO, Objects365 datasets. Experimental results show that our DetPro outperforms the baseline ViLD in all settings, e.g., +3.4 APbox and +3.0 APmask improvements on the novel classes of LVIS.

- **Summary**: Since the late 16th century, scientists have continuously innovated and developed new microscope types for various applications. Creating a new architecture from the ground up requires substantial scientific expertise and creativity, often spanning years or even decades. In this study, we propose an alternative approach called "Differentiable Microscopy," which introduces a top-down design paradigm for optical microscopes. Using all-optical phase retrieval as an illustrative example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of data-driven microscopy design through $\partial\mu$. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive comparisons with competing methods, showcasing the consistent superiority of our learned designs across multiple datasets, including biological samples. To substantiate our ideas, we experimentally validate the functionality of one of the learned designs, providing a proof of concept. The proposed differentiable microscopy framework supplements the creative process of designing new optical systems and would perhaps lead to unconventional but better optical designs.

- **Summary**: The trade-off between throughput and image quality is an inherent challenge in microscopy. To improve throughput, compressive imaging under-samples image signals; the images are then computationally reconstructed by solving a regularized inverse problem. Compared to traditional regularizers, Deep Learning based methods have achieved greater success in compression and image quality. However, the information loss in the acquisition process sets the compression bounds. Further improvement in compression, without compromising the reconstruction quality is thus a challenge. In this work, we propose differentiable compressive fluorescence microscopy ($\partial \mu$) which includes a realistic generalizable forward model with learnable-physical parameters (e.g. illumination patterns), and a novel physics-inspired inverse model. The cascaded model is end-to-end differentiable and can learn optimal compressive sampling schemes through training data. With our model, we performed thousands of numerical experiments on various compressive microscope configurations. We show that learned sampling encodes important information about the specimens in the illumination field of the microscope allowing higher compression up to $\times 1024$. We further utilize our framework for Task Aware Compression. The experimental results show superior performance on the cell segmentation task.

- **Summary**: Multi-task learning commonly encounters competition for resources among tasks, specifically when model capacity is limited. This challenge motivates models which allow control over the relative importance of tasks and total compute cost during inference time. In this work, we propose such a controllable multi-task network that dynamically adjusts its architecture and weights to match the desired task preference as well as the resource constraints. In contrast to the existing dynamic multi-task approaches that adjust only the weights within a fixed architecture, our approach affords the flexibility to dynamically control the total computational cost and match the user-preferred task importance better. We propose a disentangled training of two hypernetworks, by exploiting task affinity and a novel branching regularized loss, to take input preferences and accordingly predict tree-structured models with adapted weights. Experiments on three multi-task benchmarks, namely PASCAL-Context, NYU-v2, and CIFAR-100, show the efficacy of our approach. Project page is available at https://www.nec-labs.com/~mas/DYMU.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models tend to forget their earlier knowledge while incrementally learning new tasks. This behavior emerges because the parameter updates optimized for the new tasks may not align well with the updates suitable for older tasks. The resulting latent representation mismatch causes forgetting. In this work, we propose ELI: Energy-based Latent Aligner for Incremental Learning, which first learns an energy manifold for the latent representations such that previous task latents will have low energy and the current task latents have high energy values. This learned manifold is used to counter the representational shift that happens during incremental learning. The implicit regularization that is offered by our proposed methodology can be used as a plug-and-play module in existing incremental learning methodologies. We validate this through extensive evaluation on CIFAR-100, ImageNet subset, ImageNet 1k and Pascal VOC datasets. We observe consistent improvement when ELI is added to three prominent methodologies in class-incremental learning, across multiple incremental settings. Further, when added to the state-of-the-art incremental object detector, ELI provides over 5% improvement in detection accuracy, corroborating its effectiveness and complementary advantage to existing art.

- **Summary**: 3D-aware generative models have shown that the introduction of 3D information can lead to more controllable image generation. In particular, the current state-of-the-art model GIRAFFE can control each object's rotation, translation, scale, and scene camera pose without corresponding supervision. However, GIRAFFE only operates well when the image resolution is low. We propose GIRAFFE HD, a high-resolution 3D-aware generative model that inherits all of GIRAFFE's controllable features while generating high-quality, high-resolution images ($512^2$ resolution and above). The key idea is to leverage a style-based neural renderer, and to independently generate the foreground and background to force their disentanglement while imposing consistency constraints to stitch them together to composite a coherent final image. We demonstrate state-of-the-art 3D controllable high-resolution image generation on multiple natural image datasets.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose the LiDAR Distillation to bridge the domain gap induced by different LiDAR beams for 3D object detection. In many real-world applications, the LiDAR points used by mass-produced robots and vehicles usually have fewer beams than that in large-scale public datasets. Moreover, as the LiDARs are upgraded to other product models with different beam amount, it becomes challenging to utilize the labeled data captured by previous versions' high-resolution sensors. Despite the recent progress on domain adaptive 3D detection, most methods struggle to eliminate the beam-induced domain gap. We find that it is essential to align the point cloud density of the source domain with that of the target domain during the training process. Inspired by this discovery, we propose a progressive framework to mitigate the beam-induced domain shift. In each iteration, we first generate low-beam pseudo LiDAR by downsampling the high-beam point clouds. Then the teacher-student framework is employed to distill rich information from the data with more beams. Extensive experiments on Waymo, nuScenes and KITTI datasets with three different LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness of our LiDAR Distillation. Notably, our approach does not increase any additional computation cost for inference.

- **Summary**: Prior works on action representation learning mainly focus on designing various architectures to extract the global representations for short video clips. In contrast, many practical applications such as video alignment have strong demand for learning dense representations for long videos. In this paper, we introduce a novel contrastive action representation learning (CARL) framework to learn frame-wise action representations, especially for long videos, in a self-supervised manner. Concretely, we introduce a simple yet efficient video encoder that considers spatio-temporal context to extract frame-wise representations. Inspired by the recent progress of self-supervised learning, we present a novel sequence contrastive loss (SCL) applied on two correlated views obtained through a series of spatio-temporal data augmentations. SCL optimizes the embedding space by minimizing the KL-divergence between the sequence similarity of two augmented views and a prior Gaussian distribution of timestamp distance. Experiments on FineGym, PennAction and Pouring datasets show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin for downstream fine-grained action classification. Surprisingly, although without training on paired videos, our approach also shows outstanding performance on video alignment and fine-grained frame retrieval tasks. Code and models are available at https://github.com/minghchen/CARL_code.

- **Summary**: Traffic light recognition, as a critical component of the perception module of self-driving vehicles, plays a vital role in the intelligent transportation systems. The prevalent deep learning based traffic light recognition methods heavily hinge on the large quantity and rich diversity of training data. However, it is quite challenging to collect data in various rare scenarios such as flashing, blackout or extreme weather, thus resulting in the imbalanced distribution of training data and consequently the degraded performance in recognizing rare classes. In this paper, we seek to improve traffic light recognition by leveraging data synthesis. Inspired by the generative adversarial networks (GANs), we propose a novel traffic light generation approach TL-GAN to synthesize the data of rare classes to improve traffic light recognition for autonomous driving. TL-GAN disentangles traffic light sequence generation into image synthesis and sequence assembling. In the image synthesis stage, our approach enables conditional generation to allow full control of the color of the generated traffic light images. In the sequence assembling stage, we design the style mixing and adaptive template to synthesize realistic and diverse traffic light sequences. Extensive experiments show that the proposed TL-GAN renders remarkable improvement over the baseline without using the generated data, leading to the state-of-the-art performance in comparison with the competing algorithms that are used for general image synthesis and data imbalance tackling.

- **Summary**: Fueled by the power of deep learning techniques and implicit shape learning, recent advances in single-image human digitalization have reached unprecedented accuracy and could recover fine-grained surface details such as garment wrinkles. However, a common problem for the implicit-based methods is that they cannot produce separated and topology-consistent mesh for each garment piece, which is crucial for the current 3D content creation pipeline. To address this issue, we proposed a novel geometry inference framework ReEF that reconstructs topology-consistent layered garment mesh by registering the explicit garment template to the whole-body implicit fields predicted from single images. Experiments demonstrate that our method notably outperforms its counterparts on single-image layered garment reconstruction and could bring high-quality digital assets for further content creation.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has been widely used to analyze digitized hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histopathology whole slide images. Automated cancer segmentation using deep learning can be used to diagnose malignancy and to find novel morphological patterns to predict molecular subtypes. To train pixel-wise cancer segmentation models, manual annotation from pathologists is generally a bottleneck due to its time-consuming nature. In this paper, we propose Deep Interactive Learning with a pretrained segmentation model from a different cancer type to reduce manual annotation time. Instead of annotating all pixels from cancer and non-cancer regions on giga-pixel whole slide images, an iterative process of annotating mislabeled regions from a segmentation model and training/finetuning the model with the additional annotation can reduce the time. Especially, employing a pretrained segmentation model can further reduce the time than starting annotation from scratch. We trained an accurate ovarian cancer segmentation model with a pretrained breast segmentation model by 3.5 hours of manual annotation which achieved intersection-over-union of 0.74, recall of 0.86, and precision of 0.84. With automatically extracted high-grade serous ovarian cancer patches, we attempted to train another deep learning model to predict BRCA mutation. The segmentation model and code have been released at https://github.com/MSKCC-Computational-Pathology/DMMN-ovary.

- **Summary**: Few-shot object detection (FSOD), with the aim to detect novel objects using very few training examples, has recently attracted great research interest in the community. Metric-learning based methods have been demonstrated to be effective for this task using a two-branch based siamese network, and calculate the similarity between image regions and few-shot examples for detection. However, in previous works, the interaction between the two branches is only restricted in the detection head, while leaving the remaining hundreds of layers for separate feature extraction. Inspired by the recent work on vision transformers and vision-language transformers, we propose a novel Fully Cross-Transformer based model (FCT) for FSOD by incorporating cross-transformer into both the feature backbone and detection head. The asymmetric-batched cross-attention is proposed to aggregate the key information from the two branches with different batch sizes. Our model can improve the few-shot similarity learning between the two branches by introducing the multi-level interactions. Comprehensive experiments on both PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO FSOD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

- **Summary**: The remote sensing community has identified data fusion as one of the key challenging topics of the 21st century. The subject of image fusion in two-dimensional (2D) space has been covered in several published reviews. However, the special case of 2.5D/3D Digital Elevation Model (DEM) fusion has not been addressed till date. DEM fusion is a key application of data fusion in remote sensing. It takes advantage of the complementary characteristics of multi-source DEMs to deliver a more complete, accurate and reliable elevation dataset. Although several methods for fusing DEMs have been developed, the absence of a well-rounded review has limited their proliferation among researchers and end-users. It is often required to combine knowledge from multiple studies to inform a holistic perspective and guide further research. In response, this paper provides a systematic review of DEM fusion: the pre-processing workflow, methods and applications, enhanced with a meta-analysis. Through the discussion and comparative analysis, unresolved challenges and open issues were identified, and future directions for research were proposed. This review is a timely solution and an invaluable source of information for researchers within the fields of remote sensing and spatial information science, and the data fusion community at large.

- **Summary**: Social navigation is the capability of an autonomous agent, such as a robot, to navigate in a 'socially compliant' manner in the presence of other intelligent agents such as humans. With the emergence of autonomously navigating mobile robots in human populated environments (e.g., domestic service robots in homes and restaurants and food delivery robots on public sidewalks), incorporating socially compliant navigation behaviors on these robots becomes critical to ensuring safe and comfortable human robot coexistence. To address this challenge, imitation learning is a promising framework, since it is easier for humans to demonstrate the task of social navigation rather than to formulate reward functions that accurately capture the complex multi objective setting of social navigation. The use of imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to social navigation for mobile robots, however, is currently hindered by a lack of large scale datasets that capture socially compliant robot navigation demonstrations in the wild. To fill this gap, we introduce Socially CompliAnt Navigation Dataset (SCAND) a large scale, first person view dataset of socially compliant navigation demonstrations. Our dataset contains 8.7 hours, 138 trajectories, 25 miles of socially compliant, human teleoperated driving demonstrations that comprises multi modal data streams including 3D lidar, joystick commands, odometry, visual and inertial information, collected on two morphologically different mobile robots a Boston Dynamics Spot and a Clearpath Jackal by four different human demonstrators in both indoor and outdoor environments. We additionally perform preliminary analysis and validation through real world robot experiments and show that navigation policies learned by imitation learning on SCAND generate socially compliant behaviors

- **Summary**: Existing models that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both clean and adversarially-perturbed images rely on convolution operations conditioned with feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers. These layers require many new parameters and are hyperparameter sensitive. They significantly increase training time, memory cost, and potential latency which can prove costly for resource-limited or real-time applications. In this paper, we present a fast learnable once-for-all adversarial training (FLOAT) algorithm, which instead of the existing FiLM-based conditioning, presents a unique weight conditioned learning that requires no additional layer, thereby incurring no significant increase in parameter count, training time, or network latency compared to standard adversarial training. In particular, we add configurable scaled noise to the weight tensors that enables a trade-off between clean and adversarial performance. Extensive experiments show that FLOAT can yield SOTA performance improving both clean and perturbed image classification by up to ~6% and ~10%, respectively. Moreover, real hardware measurement shows that FLOAT can reduce the training time by up to 1.43x with fewer model parameters of up to 1.47x on iso-hyperparameter settings compared to the FiLM-based alternatives. Additionally, to further improve memory efficiency we introduce FLOAT sparse (FLOATS), a form of non-iterative model pruning and provide detailed empirical analysis to provide a three way accuracy-robustness-complexity trade-off for these new class of pruned conditionally trained models.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral images provide a rich representation of the underlying spectrum for each pixel, allowing for a pixel-wise classification/segmentation into different classes. As the acquisition of labeled training data is very time-consuming, unsupervised methods become crucial in hyperspectral image analysis. The spectral variability and noise in hyperspectral data make this task very challenging and define special requirements for such methods.   Here, we present a novel unsupervised hyperspectral segmentation framework. It starts with a denoising and dimensionality reduction step by the well-established Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transform. Then, the Mumford-Shah (MS) segmentation functional is applied to segment the data. We equipped the MS functional with a novel robust distribution-dependent indicator function designed to handle the characteristic challenges of hyperspectral data. To optimize our objective function with respect to the parameters for which no closed form solution is available, we propose an efficient fixed point iteration scheme. Numerical experiments on four public benchmark datasets show that our method produces competitive results, which outperform three state-of-the-art methods substantially on three of these datasets.

- **Summary**: The ability to predict lung and heart based diseases using deep learning techniques is central to many researchers, particularly in the medical field around the world. In this paper, we present a unique outlook of a very familiar problem of disease classification using X-rays. We present a hypothesis that X-rays of patients included with the follow up history of their most recent three chest X-ray images would perform better in disease classification in comparison to one chest X-ray image input using an internal CNN to perform feature extraction. We have discovered that our generic deep learning architecture which we propose for solving this problem performs well with 3 input X ray images provided per sample for each patient. In this paper, we have also established that without additional layers before the output classification, the CNN models will improve the performance of predicting the disease labels for each patient. We have provided our results in ROC curves and AUROC scores. We define a fresh approach of collecting three X-ray images for training deep learning models, which we have concluded has clearly improved the performance of the models. We have shown that ResNet, in general, has a better result than any other CNN model used in the feature extraction phase. With our original approach to data pre-processing, image training, and pre-trained models, we believe that the current research will assist many medical institutions around the world, and this will improve the prediction of patients' symptoms and diagnose them with more accurate cure.

- **Summary**: CounterFactual (CF) visual explanations try to find images similar to the query image that change the decision of a vision system to a specified outcome. Existing methods either require inference-time optimization or joint training with a generative adversarial model which makes them time-consuming and difficult to use in practice. We propose a novel approach, Cycle-Consistent Counterfactuals by Latent Transformations (C3LT), which learns a latent transformation that automatically generates visual CFs by steering in the latent space of generative models. Our method uses cycle consistency between the query and CF latent representations which helps our training to find better solutions. C3LT can be easily plugged into any state-of-the-art pretrained generative network. This enables our method to generate high-quality and interpretable CF images at high resolution such as those in ImageNet. In addition to several established metrics for evaluating CF explanations, we introduce a novel metric tailored to assess the quality of the generated CF examples and validate the effectiveness of our method on an extensive set of experiments.

- **Summary**: This paper presents DeepShadow, a one-shot method for recovering the depth map and surface normals from photometric stereo shadow maps. Previous works that try to recover the surface normals from photometric stereo images treat cast shadows as a disturbance. We show that the self and cast shadows not only do not disturb 3D reconstruction, but can be used alone, as a strong learning signal, to recover the depth map and surface normals. We demonstrate that 3D reconstruction from shadows can even outperform shape-from-shading in certain cases. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to reconstruct 3D shape-from-shadows using neural networks. The method does not require any pre-training or expensive labeled data, and is optimized during inference time.

- **Summary**: Face verification systems aim to validate the claimed identity using feature vectors and distance metrics. However, no attempt has been made to bypass such a system using generated images that are constrained by the same feature vectors. In this work, we train StarGAN v2 to generate diverse images based on a human user, that have similar feature vectors yet qualitatively look different. We then demonstrate a proof of concept on a custom face verification system and verify our claims by demonstrating the same proof of concept in a black box setting on dating applications that utilize similar face verification systems.

- **Summary**: Here, we present an end-to-end method to create 2D animation for a goalkeeper attempting to block a penalty kick, and then correct that motion using an iterative nonlinear optimization scheme. The input is a raw video that is fed into pose and object detection networks to find the skeleton of the goalkeeper and the ball. The output is a set of key frames of the skeleton associated with the corrected motion so that if the goalkeeper missed the ball, the animation will show then successfully deflecting it. Our method is robust enough correct different kinds of mistakes the goalkeeper can make, such as not lunging far enough or jumping to the incorrect side. Our method is also meant to be semantically similar to the goalkeeper's original motion, which helps keep our animation grounded with respect to actual human behavior.

- **Summary**: There are two main algorithmic approaches to autonomous driving systems: (1) An end-to-end system in which a single deep neural network learns to map sensory input directly into appropriate warning and driving responses. (2) A mediated hybrid recognition system in which a system is created by combining independent modules that detect each semantic feature. While some researchers believe that deep learning can solve any problem, others believe that a more engineered and symbolic approach is needed to cope with complex environments with less data. Deep learning alone has achieved state-of-the-art results in many areas, from complex gameplay to predicting protein structures. In particular, in image classification and recognition, deep learning models have achieved accuracies as high as humans. But sometimes it can be very difficult to debug if the deep learning model doesn't work. Deep learning models can be vulnerable and are very sensitive to changes in data distribution. Generalization can be problematic. It's usually hard to prove why it works or doesn't. Deep learning models can also be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Here, we combine deep learning-based object recognition and tracking with an adaptive neurosymbolic network agent, called the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), that can adapt to its environment by building concepts based on perceptual sequences. We achieved an improved intersection-over-union (IOU) object recognition performance of 0.65 in the adaptive retraining model compared to IOU 0.31 in the COCO data pre-trained model. We improved the object detection limits using RADAR sensors in a simulated environment, and demonstrated the weaving car detection capability by combining deep learning-based object detection and tracking with a neurosymbolic model.

- **Summary**: Extracting rich phenotype information, such as cell density and arrangement, from whole slide histology images (WSIs), requires analysis of large field of view, i.e more contexual information. This can be achieved through analyzing the digital slides at lower resolution. A potential drawback is missing out on details present at a higher resolution. To jointly leverage complementary information from multiple resolutions, we present a novel transformer based Pyramidal Context-Detail Network (CD-Net). CD-Net exploits the WSI pyramidal structure through co-training of proposed Context and Detail Modules, which operate on inputs from multiple resolutions. The residual connections between the modules enable the joint training paradigm while learning self-supervised representation for WSIs. The efficacy of CD-Net is demonstrated in classifying Lung Adenocarcinoma from Squamous cell carcinoma.

- **Summary**: Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) systems produce high-resolution images of the seabed environment. Moreover, deep learning has demonstrated superior ability in finding robust features for automating imagery analysis. However, the success of deep learning is conditioned on having lots of labeled training data, but obtaining generous pixel-level annotations of SAS imagery is often practically infeasible. This challenge has thus far limited the adoption of deep learning methods for SAS segmentation. Algorithms exist to segment SAS imagery in an unsupervised manner, but they lack the benefit of state-of-the-art learning methods and the results present significant room for improvement. In view of the above, we propose a new iterative algorithm for unsupervised SAS image segmentation combining superpixel formation, deep learning, and traditional clustering methods. We call our method Iterative Deep Unsupervised Segmentation (IDUS). IDUS is an unsupervised learning framework that can be divided into four main steps: 1) A deep network estimates class assignments. 2) Low-level image features from the deep network are clustered into superpixels. 3) Superpixels are clustered into class assignments (which we call pseudo-labels) using $k$-means. 4) Resulting pseudo-labels are used for loss backpropagation of the deep network prediction. These four steps are performed iteratively until convergence. A comparison of IDUS to current state-of-the-art methods on a realistic benchmark dataset for SAS image segmentation demonstrates the benefits of our proposal even as the IDUS incurs a much lower computational burden during inference (actual labeling of a test image). Finally, we also develop a semi-supervised (SS) extension of IDUS called IDSS and demonstrate experimentally that it can further enhance performance while outperforming supervised alternatives that exploit the same labeled training imagery.

- **Summary**: In text-video retrieval, the objective is to learn a cross-modal similarity function between a text and a video that ranks relevant text-video pairs higher than irrelevant pairs. However, videos inherently express a much wider gamut of information than texts. Instead, texts often capture sub-regions of entire videos and are most semantically similar to certain frames within videos. Therefore, for a given text, a retrieval model should focus on the text's most semantically similar video sub-regions to make a more relevant comparison. Yet, most existing works aggregate entire videos without directly considering text. Common text-agnostic aggregations schemes include mean-pooling or self-attention over the frames, but these are likely to encode misleading visual information not described in the given text. To address this, we propose a cross-modal attention model called X-Pool that reasons between a text and the frames of a video. Our core mechanism is a scaled dot product attention for a text to attend to its most semantically similar frames. We then generate an aggregated video representation conditioned on the text's attention weights over the frames. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets of MSR-VTT, MSVD and LSMDC, achieving new state-of-the-art results by up to 12% in relative improvement in Recall@1. Our findings thereby highlight the importance of joint text-video reasoning to extract important visual cues according to text.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation enables robots to learn 3D perception from raw video streams. This scalable approach leverages projective geometry and ego-motion to learn via view synthesis, assuming the world is mostly static. Dynamic scenes, which are common in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction, violate this assumption. Therefore, they require modeling dynamic objects explicitly, for instance via estimating pixel-wise 3D motion, i.e. scene flow. However, the simultaneous self-supervised learning of depth and scene flow is ill-posed, as there are infinitely many combinations that result in the same 3D point. In this paper we propose DRAFT, a new method capable of jointly learning depth, optical flow, and scene flow by combining synthetic data with geometric self-supervision. Building upon the RAFT architecture, we learn optical flow as an intermediate task to bootstrap depth and scene flow learning via triangulation. Our algorithm also leverages temporal and geometric consistency losses across tasks to improve multi-task learning. Our DRAFT architecture simultaneously establishes a new state of the art in all three tasks in the self-supervised monocular setting on the standard KITTI benchmark.

- **Summary**: Existing works show that although modern neural networks achieve remarkable generalization performance on the in-distribution (ID) dataset, the accuracy drops significantly on the out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets \cite{recht2018cifar, recht2019imagenet}. To understand why a variety of models consistently make more mistakes in the OOD datasets, we propose a new metric to quantify the difficulty of the test images (either ID or OOD) that depends on the interaction of the training dataset and the model. In particular, we introduce \textit{confusion score} as a label-free measure of image difficulty which quantifies the amount of disagreement on a given test image based on the class conditional probabilities estimated by an ensemble of trained models. Using the confusion score, we investigate CIFAR-10 and its OOD derivatives. Next, by partitioning test and OOD datasets via their confusion scores, we predict the relationship between ID and OOD accuracies for various architectures. This allows us to obtain an estimator of the OOD accuracy of a given model only using ID test labels. Our observations indicate that the biggest contribution to the accuracy drop comes from images with high confusion scores. Upon further inspection, we report on the nature of the misclassified images grouped by their confusion scores: \textit{(i)} images with high confusion scores contain \textit{weak spurious correlations} that appear in multiple classes in the training data and lack clear \textit{class-specific features}, and \textit{(ii)} images with low confusion scores exhibit spurious correlations that belong to another class, namely \textit{class-specific spurious correlations}.

- **Summary**: Prevalent semantic segmentation solutions, despite their different network designs (FCN based or attention based) and mask decoding strategies (parametric softmax based or pixel-query based), can be placed in one category, by considering the softmax weights or query vectors as learnable class prototypes. In light of this prototype view, this study uncovers several limitations of such parametric segmentation regime, and proposes a nonparametric alternative based on non-learnable prototypes. Instead of prior methods learning a single weight/query vector for each class in a fully parametric manner, our model represents each class as a set of non-learnable prototypes, relying solely on the mean features of several training pixels within that class. The dense prediction is thus achieved by nonparametric nearest prototype retrieving. This allows our model to directly shape the pixel embedding space, by optimizing the arrangement between embedded pixels and anchored prototypes. It is able to handle arbitrary number of classes with a constant amount of learnable parameters. We empirically show that, with FCN based and attention based segmentation models (i.e., HRNet, Swin, SegFormer) and backbones (i.e., ResNet, HRNet, Swin, MiT), our nonparametric framework yields compelling results over several datasets (i.e., ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff), and performs well in the large-vocabulary situation. We expect this work will provoke a rethink of the current de facto semantic segmentation model design.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection is a central task for applications such as autonomous driving, in which the system needs to localize and classify surrounding traffic agents, even in the presence of adverse weather. In this paper, we address the problem of LiDAR-based 3D object detection under snowfall. Due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating training data in this setting, we propose a physically based method to simulate the effect of snowfall on real clear-weather LiDAR point clouds. Our method samples snow particles in 2D space for each LiDAR line and uses the induced geometry to modify the measurement for each LiDAR beam accordingly. Moreover, as snowfall often causes wetness on the ground, we also simulate ground wetness on LiDAR point clouds. We use our simulation to generate partially synthetic snowy LiDAR data and leverage these data for training 3D object detection models that are robust to snowfall. We conduct an extensive evaluation using several state-of-the-art 3D object detection methods and show that our simulation consistently yields significant performance gains on the real snowy STF dataset compared to clear-weather baselines and competing simulation approaches, while not sacrificing performance in clear weather. Our code is available at www.github.com/SysCV/LiDAR_snow_sim.

- **Summary**: Visual odometry is the process of estimating the position and orientation of a camera by analyzing the images associated to it. This paper develops a quick and accurate approach to visual odometry of a moving RGB-D camera navigating on a static environment. The proposed algorithm uses SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) as feature extractor, RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) to filter the results and Minimum Mean Square to estimate the rigid transformation of six parameters between successive video frames. Data from a Kinect camera were used in the tests. The results show that this approach is feasible and promising, surpassing in performance the algorithms ICP (Interactive Closest Point) and SfM (Structure from Motion) in tests using a publicly available dataset.

- **Summary**: Natural language-based communication with mobile devices and home appliances is becoming increasingly popular and has the potential to become natural for communicating with mobile robots in the future. Towards this goal, we investigate cross-modal text-to-point-cloud localization that will allow us to specify, for example, a vehicle pick-up or goods delivery location. In particular, we propose Text2Pos, a cross-modal localization module that learns to align textual descriptions with localization cues in a coarse- to-fine manner. Given a point cloud of the environment, Text2Pos locates a position that is specified via a natural language-based description of the immediate surroundings. To train Text2Pos and study its performance, we construct KITTI360Pose, the first dataset for this task based on the recently introduced KITTI360 dataset. Our experiments show that we can localize 65% of textual queries within 15m distance to query locations for top-10 retrieved locations. This is a starting point that we hope will spark future developments towards language-based navigation.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel architecture for depth estimation from a single image. The architecture itself is based on the popular encoder-decoder architecture that is frequently used as a starting point for all dense regression tasks. We build on AdaBins which estimates a global distribution of depth values for the input image and evolve the architecture in two ways. First, instead of predicting global depth distributions, we predict depth distributions of local neighborhoods at every pixel. Second, instead of predicting depth distributions only towards the end of the decoder, we involve all layers of the decoder. We call this new architecture LocalBins. Our results demonstrate a clear improvement over the state-of-the-art in all metrics on the NYU-Depth V2 dataset. Code and pretrained models will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Scene text detection and document layout analysis have long been treated as two separate tasks in different image domains. In this paper, we bring them together and introduce the task of unified scene text detection and layout analysis. The first hierarchical scene text dataset is introduced to enable this novel research task. We also propose a novel method that is able to simultaneously detect scene text and form text clusters in a unified way. Comprehensive experiments show that our unified model achieves better performance than multiple well-designed baseline methods. Additionally, this model achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple scene text detection datasets without the need of complex post-processing.
