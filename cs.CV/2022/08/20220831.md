- **Summary**: In object detection, data amount and cost are a trade-off, and collecting a large amount of data in a specific domain is labor intensive. Therefore, existing large-scale datasets are used for pre-training. However, conventional transfer learning and domain adaptation cannot bridge the domain gap when the target domain differs significantly from the source domain. We propose a data synthesis method that can solve the large domain gap problem. In this method, a part of the target image is pasted onto the source image, and the position of the pasted region is aligned by utilizing the information of the object bounding box. In addition, we introduce adversarial learning to discriminate whether the original or the pasted regions. The proposed method trains on a large number of source images and a few target domain images. The proposed method achieves higher accuracy than conventional methods in a very different domain problem setting, where RGB images are the source domain, and thermal infrared images are the target domain. Similarly, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in the cases of simulation images to real images.

- **Summary**: This paper looks at semi-supervised learning (SSL) for image-based text recognition. One of the most popular SSL approaches is pseudo-labeling (PL). PL approaches assign labels to unlabeled data before re-training the model with a combination of labeled and pseudo-labeled data. However, PL methods are severely degraded by noise and are prone to over-fitting to noisy labels, due to the inclusion of erroneous high confidence pseudo-labels generated from poorly calibrated models, thus, rendering threshold-based selection ineffective. Moreover, the combinatorial complexity of the hypothesis space and the error accumulation due to multiple incorrect autoregressive steps posit pseudo-labeling challenging for sequence models. To this end, we propose a pseudo-label generation and an uncertainty-based data selection framework for semi-supervised text recognition. We first use Beam-Search inference to yield highly probable hypotheses to assign pseudo-labels to the unlabelled examples. Then we adopt an ensemble of models, sampled by applying dropout, to obtain a robust estimate of the uncertainty associated with the prediction, considering both the character-level and word-level predictive distribution to select good quality pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on several benchmark handwriting and scene-text datasets show that our method outperforms the baseline approaches and the previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised text-recognition methods.

- **Summary**: With the popularity of mobile devices, e.g., smartphone and wearable devices, lighter and faster model is crucial for the application of video super resolution. However, most previous lightweight models tend to concentrate on reducing lantency of model inference on desktop GPU, which may be not energy efficient in current mobile devices. In this paper, we proposed Extreme Low-Power Super Resolution (ELSR) network which only consumes a small amount of energy in mobile devices. Pretraining and finetuning methods are applied to boost the performance of the extremely tiny model. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a excellent balance between restoration quality and power consumption. Finally, we achieve a competitive score of 90.9 with PSNR 27.34 dB and power 0.09 W/30FPS on the target MediaTek Dimensity 9000 plantform, ranking 1st place in the Mobile AI & AIM 2022 Real-Time Video Super-Resolution Challenge.

- **Summary**: Objective quality assessment of 3D point clouds is essential for the development of immersive multimedia systems in real-world applications. Despite the success of perceptual quality evaluation for 2D images and videos, blind/no-reference metrics are still scarce for 3D point clouds with large-scale irregularly distributed 3D points. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an objective point cloud quality index with Structure Guided Resampling (SGR) to automatically evaluate the perceptually visual quality of 3D dense point clouds. The proposed SGR is a general-purpose blind quality assessment method without the assistance of any reference information. Specifically, considering that the human visual system (HVS) is highly sensitive to structure information, we first exploit the unique normal vectors of point clouds to execute regional pre-processing which consists of keypoint resampling and local region construction. Then, we extract three groups of quality-related features, including: 1) geometry density features; 2) color naturalness features; 3) angular consistency features. Both the cognitive peculiarities of the human brain and naturalness regularity are involved in the designed quality-aware features that can capture the most vital aspects of distorted 3D point clouds. Extensive experiments on several publicly available subjective point cloud quality databases validate that our proposed SGR can compete with state-of-the-art full-reference, reduced-reference, and no-reference quality assessment algorithms.



### SIM-Trans: Structure Information Modeling Transformer for Fine-grained Visual Categorization

- **Summary**: Fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) aims at recognizing objects from similar subordinate categories, which is challenging and practical for human's accurate automatic recognition needs. Most FGVC approaches focus on the attention mechanism research for discriminative regions mining while neglecting their interdependencies and composed holistic object structure, which are essential for model's discriminative information localization and understanding ability. To address the above limitations, we propose the Structure Information Modeling Transformer (SIM-Trans) to incorporate object structure information into transformer for enhancing discriminative representation learning to contain both the appearance information and structure information. Specifically, we encode the image into a sequence of patch tokens and build a strong vision transformer framework with two well-designed modules: (i) the structure information learning (SIL) module is proposed to mine the spatial context relation of significant patches within the object extent with the help of the transformer's self-attention weights, which is further injected into the model for importing structure information; (ii) the multi-level feature boosting (MFB) module is introduced to exploit the complementary of multi-level features and contrastive learning among classes to enhance feature robustness for accurate recognition. The proposed two modules are light-weighted and can be plugged into any transformer network and trained end-to-end easily, which only depends on the attention weights that come with the vision transformer itself. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that the proposed SIM-Trans achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained visual categorization benchmarks.

- **Summary**: A number of private and public insurers compensate workers whose hearing loss can be directly attributed to excessive exposure to noise in the workplace. The claim assessment process is typically lengthy and requires significant effort from human adjudicators who must interpret hand-recorded audiograms, often sent via fax or equivalent. In this work, we present a solution developed in partnership with the Workplace Safety Insurance Board of Ontario to streamline the adjudication process. In particular, we present the first audiogram digitization algorithm capable of automatically extracting the hearing thresholds from a scanned or faxed audiology report as a proof-of-concept. The algorithm extracts most thresholds within 5 dB accuracy, allowing to substantially lessen the time required to convert an audiogram into digital format in a semi-supervised fashion, and is a first step towards the automation of the adjudication process. The source code for the digitization algorithm and a desktop-based implementation of our NIHL annotation portal is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/GreenCUBIC/AudiogramDigitization).

- **Summary**: Camera traps, unmanned observation devices, and deep learning-based image recognition systems have greatly reduced human effort in collecting and analyzing wildlife images. However, data collected via above apparatus exhibits 1) long-tailed and 2) open-ended distribution problems. To tackle the open-set long-tailed recognition problem, we propose the Temporal Flow Mask Attention Network that comprises three key building blocks: 1) an optical flow module, 2) an attention residual module, and 3) a meta-embedding classifier. We extract temporal features of sequential frames using the optical flow module and learn informative representation using attention residual blocks. Moreover, we show that applying the meta-embedding technique boosts the performance of the method in open-set long-tailed recognition. We apply this method on a Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) dataset. We conduct extensive experiments, and quantitative and qualitative analyses to prove that our method effectively tackles the open-set long-tailed recognition problem while being robust to unknown classes.

- **Summary**: Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) is a non-invasive technique capturing cross-sectional area of the retina in micro-meter resolutions. It has been widely used as a auxiliary imaging reference to detect eye-related pathology and predict longitudinal progression of the disease characteristics. Retina layer segmentation is one of the crucial feature extraction techniques, where the variations of retinal layer thicknesses and the retinal layer deformation due to the presence of the fluid are highly correlated with multiple epidemic eye diseases like Diabetic Retinopathy(DR) and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). However, these images are acquired from different devices, which have different intensity distribution, or in other words, belong to different imaging domains. This paper proposes a segmentation-guided domain-adaptation method to adapt images from multiple devices into single image domain, where the state-of-art pre-trained segmentation model is available. It avoids the time consumption of manual labelling for the upcoming new dataset and the re-training of the existing network. The semantic consistency and global feature consistency of the network will minimize the hallucination effect that many researchers reported regarding Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks(CycleGAN) architecture.

- **Summary**: This paper provides a brief overview of our submission to the no interaction track of SAPIEN ManiSkill Challenge 2021. Our approach follows an end-to-end pipeline which mainly consists of two steps: we first extract the point cloud features of multiple objects; then we adopt these features to predict the action score of the robot simulators through a deep and wide transformer-based network. More specially, %to give guidance for future work, to open up avenues for exploitation of learning manipulation skill, we present an empirical study that includes a bag of tricks and abortive attempts. Finally, our method achieves a promising ranking on the leaderboard. All code of our solution is available at https://github.com/liu666666/bigfish\_codes.

- **Summary**: Although CLIP-like Visual Language Models provide a functional joint feature space for image and text, due to the limitation of the CILP-like model's image input size (e.g., 224), subtle details are lost in the feature representation if we input high-resolution images (e.g., 2240). In this work, we introduce an efficient framework that can produce a single feature representation for a high-resolution image that injects image details and shares the same semantic space as the original CLIP. In the framework, we train a feature fusing model based on CLIP features extracted from a carefully designed image patch method that can cover objects of any scale, weakly supervised by image-agnostic class prompted queries. We validate our framework by retrieving images from class prompted queries on the real world and synthetic datasets, showing significant performance improvement on these tasks. Furthermore, to fully demonstrate our framework's detail retrieval ability, we construct a CLEVR-like synthetic dataset called CLVER-DS, which is fully annotated and has a controllable object scale.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer and its variants have demonstrated great potential in various computer vision tasks. But conventional vision transformers often focus on global dependency at a coarse level, which suffer from a learning challenge on global relationships and fine-grained representation at a token level. In this paper, we introduce Multi-scale Attention Fusion into transformer (MAFormer), which explores local aggregation and global feature extraction in a dual-stream framework for visual recognition. We develop a simple but effective module to explore the full potential of transformers for visual representation by learning fine-grained and coarse-grained features at a token level and dynamically fusing them. Our Multi-scale Attention Fusion (MAF) block consists of: i) a local window attention branch that learns short-range interactions within windows, aggregating fine-grained local features; ii) global feature extraction through a novel Global Learning with Down-sampling (GLD) operation to efficiently capture long-range context information within the whole image; iii) a fusion module that self-explores the integration of both features via attention. Our MAFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on common vision tasks. In particular, MAFormer-L achieves 85.9$\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing CSWin-B and LV-ViT-L by 1.7$\%$ and 0.6$\%$ respectively. On MSCOCO, MAFormer outperforms the prior art CSWin by 1.7$\%$ mAPs on object detection and 1.4$\%$ on instance segmentation with similar-sized parameters, demonstrating the potential to be a general backbone network.

- **Summary**: We propose a lightweight, single image super-resolution network for mobile devices, named XCAT. XCAT introduces Heterogeneous Group Convolution Blocks with Cross Concatenations (HXBlock). The heterogeneous split of the input channels to the group convolution blocks reduces the number of operations, and cross concatenation allows for information flow between the intermediate input tensors of cascaded HXBlocks. Cross concatenations inside HXBlocks can also avoid using more expensive operations like 1x1 convolutions. To further prev ent expensive tensor copy operations, XCAT utilizes non-trainable convolution kernels to apply up sampling operations. Designed with integer quantization in mind, XCAT also utilizes several techniques on training, like intensity-based data augmentation. Integer quantized XCAT operates in real time on Mali-G71 MP2 GPU with 320ms, and on Synaptics Dolphin NPU with 30ms (NCHW) and 8.8ms (NHWC), suitable for real-time applications.

- **Summary**: Image retrieval systems help users to browse and search among extensive images in real-time. With the rise of cloud computing, retrieval tasks are usually outsourced to cloud servers. However, the cloud scenario brings a daunting challenge of privacy protection as cloud servers cannot be fully trusted. To this end, image-encryption-based privacy-preserving image retrieval schemes have been developed, which first extract features from cipher-images, and then build retrieval models based on these features. Yet, most existing approaches extract shallow features and design trivial retrieval models, resulting in insufficient expressiveness for the cipher-images. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm named Encrypted Vision Transformer (EViT), which advances the discriminative representations capability of cipher-images. First, in order to capture comprehensive ruled information, we extract multi-level local length sequence and global Huffman-code frequency features from the cipher-images which are encrypted by stream cipher during JPEG compression process. Second, we design the Vision Transformer-based retrieval model to couple with the multi-level features, and propose two adaptive data augmentation methods to improve representation power of the retrieval model. Our proposal can be easily adapted to unsupervised and supervised settings via self-supervised contrastive learning manner. Extensive experiments reveal that EViT achieves both excellent encryption and retrieval performance, outperforming current schemes in terms of retrieval accuracy by large margins while protecting image privacy effectively.

- **Summary**: With the increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in critical autonomous systems, runtime monitors have been developed to detect prediction errors and keep the system in a safe state during operations. Monitors have been proposed for different applications involving diverse perception tasks and ML models, and specific evaluation procedures and metrics are used for different contexts. This paper introduces three unified safety-oriented metrics, representing the safety benefits of the monitor (Safety Gain), the remaining safety gaps after using it (Residual Hazard), and its negative impact on the system's performance (Availability Cost). To compute these metrics, one requires to define two return functions, representing how a given ML prediction will impact expected future rewards and hazards. Three use-cases (classification, drone landing, and autonomous driving) are used to demonstrate how metrics from the literature can be expressed in terms of the proposed metrics. Experimental results on these examples show how different evaluation choices impact the perceived performance of a monitor. As our formalism requires us to formulate explicit safety assumptions, it allows us to ensure that the evaluation conducted matches the high-level system requirements.

- **Summary**: Object detection networks have reached an impressive performance level, yet a lack of suitable data in specific applications often limits it in practice. Typically, additional data sources are utilized to support the training task. In these, however, domain gaps between different data sources pose a challenge in deep learning. GAN-based image-to-image style-transfer is commonly applied to shrink the domain gap, but is unstable and decoupled from the object detection task. We propose AWADA, an Attention-Weighted Adversarial Domain Adaptation framework for creating a feedback loop between style-transformation and detection task. By constructing foreground object attention maps from object detector proposals, we focus the transformation on foreground object regions and stabilize style-transfer training. In extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that AWADA reaches state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation object detection performance in the commonly used benchmarks for tasks such as synthetic-to-real, adverse weather and cross-camera adaptation.

- **Summary**: Most current methods generate adversarial examples with the $L_p$ norm specification. As a result, many defense methods utilize this property to eliminate the impact of such attacking algorithms. In this paper,we instead introduce "unrestricted" perturbations that create adversarial samples by using spurious relations which were learned by model training. Specifically, we find feature clusters in non-semantic features that are strongly correlated with model judgment results, and treat them as spurious relations learned by the model. Then we create adversarial samples by using them to replace the corresponding feature clusters in the target image. Experimental evaluations show that in both black-box and white-box situations. Our adversarial examples do not change the semantics of images, while still being effective at fooling an adversarially trained DNN image classifier.

- **Summary**: While recent face recognition (FR) systems achieve excellent results in many deployment scenarios, their performance in challenging real-world settings is still under question. For this reason, face image quality assessment (FIQA) techniques aim to support FR systems, by providing them with sample quality information that can be used to reject poor quality data unsuitable for recognition purposes. Several groups of FIQA methods relying on different concepts have been proposed in the literature, all of which can be used for generating quality scores of facial images that can serve as pseudo ground-truth (quality) labels and can be exploited for training (regression-based) quality estimation models. Several FIQA appro\-aches show that a significant amount of sample-quality information can be extracted from mated similarity-score distributions generated with some face matcher. Based on this insight, we propose in this paper a quality label optimization approach, which incorporates sample-quality information from mated-pair similarities into quality predictions of existing off-the-shelf FIQA techniques. We evaluate the proposed approach using three state-of-the-art FIQA methods over three diverse datasets. The results of our experiments show that the proposed optimization procedure heavily depends on the number of executed optimization iterations. At ten iterations, the approach seems to perform the best, consistently outperforming the base quality scores of the three FIQA methods, chosen for the experiments.

- **Summary**: We present the design and baseline results for a new challenge in the ChaLearn meta-learning series, accepted at NeurIPS'22, focusing on "cross-domain" meta-learning. Meta-learning aims to leverage experience gained from previous tasks to solve new tasks efficiently (i.e., with better performance, little training data, and/or modest computational resources). While previous challenges in the series focused on within-domain few-shot learning problems, with the aim of learning efficiently N-way k-shot tasks (i.e., N class classification problems with k training examples), this competition challenges the participants to solve "any-way" and "any-shot" problems drawn from various domains (healthcare, ecology, biology, manufacturing, and others), chosen for their humanitarian and societal impact. To that end, we created Meta-Album, a meta-dataset of 40 image classification datasets from 10 domains, from which we carve out tasks with any number of "ways" (within the range 2-20) and any number of "shots" (within the range 1-20). The competition is with code submission, fully blind-tested on the CodaLab challenge platform. The code of the winners will be open-sourced, enabling the deployment of automated machine learning solutions for few-shot image classification across several domains.

- **Summary**: Table structure recognition is a crucial part of document image analysis domain. Its difficulty lies in the need to parse the physical coordinates and logical indices of each cell at the same time. However, the existing methods are difficult to achieve both these goals, especially when the table splitting lines are blurred or tilted. In this paper, we propose an accurate and end-to-end transformer-based table structure recognition method, referred to as TRUST. Transformers are suitable for table structure recognition because of their global computations, perfect memory, and parallel computation. By introducing novel Transformer-based Query-based Splitting Module and Vertex-based Merging Module, the table structure recognition problem is decoupled into two joint optimization sub-tasks: multi-oriented table row/column splitting and table grid merging. The Query-based Splitting Module learns strong context information from long dependencies via Transformer networks, accurately predicts the multi-oriented table row/column separators, and obtains the basic grids of the table accordingly. The Vertex-based Merging Module is capable of aggregating local contextual information between adjacent basic grids, providing the ability to merge basic girds that belong to the same spanning cell accurately. We conduct experiments on several popular benchmarks including PubTabNet and SynthTable, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results. In particular, TRUST runs at 10 FPS on PubTabNet, surpassing the previous methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based generative models have achieved promising results recently, but raise an array of open questions in terms of conceptual understanding, theoretical analysis, algorithm improvement and extensions to discrete, structured, non-Euclidean domains. This work tries to re-exam the overall framework, in order to gain better theoretical understandings and develop algorithmic extensions for data from arbitrary domains. By viewing diffusion models as latent variable models with unobserved diffusion trajectories and applying maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with latent trajectories imputed from an auxiliary distribution, we show that both the model construction and the imputation of latent trajectories amount to constructing diffusion bridge processes that achieve deterministic values and constraints at end point, for which we provide a systematic study and a suit of tools. Leveraging our framework, we present 1) a first theoretical error analysis for learning diffusion generation models, and 2) a simple and unified approach to learning on data from different discrete and constrained domains. Experiments show that our methods perform superbly on generating images, semantic segments and 3D point clouds.

- **Summary**: In order to get raw images of high quality for downstream Image Signal Process (ISP), in this paper we present an Efficient Locally Multiplicative Transformer called ELMformer for raw image restoration. ELMformer contains two core designs especially for raw images whose primitive attribute is single-channel. The first design is a Bi-directional Fusion Projection (BFP) module, where we consider both the color characteristics of raw images and spatial structure of single-channel. The second one is that we propose a Locally Multiplicative Self-Attention (L-MSA) scheme to effectively deliver information from the local space to relevant parts. ELMformer can efficiently reduce the computational consumption and perform well on raw image restoration tasks. Enhanced by these two core designs, ELMformer achieves the highest performance and keeps the lowest FLOPs on raw denoising and raw deblurring benchmarks compared with state-of-the-arts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization ability of ELMformer. On SIDD benchmark, our method has even better denoising performance than ISP-based methods which need huge amount of additional sRGB training images. The codes are release at https://github.com/leonmakise/ELMformer.

- **Summary**: Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods did not handle the cross-domain problem from the perspective of frequency for computer vision. The images or feature maps of different domains can be decomposed into the low-frequency component and high-frequency component. This paper proposes the assumption that low-frequency information is more domain-invariant while the high-frequency information contains domain-related information. Hence, we introduce an approach, named low-frequency module (LFM), to extract domain-invariant feature representations. The LFM is constructed with the digital Gaussian low-pass filter. Our method is easy to implement and introduces no extra hyperparameter. We design two effective ways to utilize the LFM for domain adaptation, and our method is complementary to other existing methods and formulated as a plug-and-play unit that can be combined with these methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our LFM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for various computer vision tasks, including image classification and object detection.

- **Summary**: Automatic segmentation of tumor lesions is a critical initial processing step for quantitative PET/CT analysis. However, numerous tumor lesion with different shapes, sizes, and uptake intensity may be distributed in different anatomical contexts throughout the body, and there is also significant uptake in healthy organs. Therefore, building a systemic PET/CT tumor lesion segmentation model is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy to build deep learning models capable of systemic tumor segmentation. Our method is validated on the training set of the AutoPET 2022 Challenge. We achieved 0.7574 Dice score, 0.0299 false positive volume and 0.2538 false negative volume on preliminary test set.The code of our work is available on the following link: https://github.com/ZZZsn/MICCAI2022-autopet.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection from monocular image(s) is a challenging and long-standing problem of computer vision. To combine information from different perspectives without troublesome 2D instance tracking, recent methods tend to aggregate multiview feature by sampling regular 3D grid densely in space, which is inefficient. In this paper, we attempt to improve multi-view feature aggregation by proposing a learnable keypoints sampling method, which scatters pseudo surface points in 3D space, in order to keep data sparsity. The scattered points augmented by multi-view geometric constraints and visual features are then employed to infer objects location and shape in the scene. To make up the limitations of single frame and model multi-view geometry explicitly, we further propose a surface filter module for noise suppression. Experimental results show that our method achieves significantly better performance than previous works in terms of 3D detection (more than 0.1 AP improvement on some categories of ScanNet). The code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Traditionally, 3D indoor scene reconstruction from posed images happens in two phases: per-image depth estimation, followed by depth merging and surface reconstruction. Recently, a family of methods have emerged that perform reconstruction directly in final 3D volumetric feature space. While these methods have shown impressive reconstruction results, they rely on expensive 3D convolutional layers, limiting their application in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we instead go back to the traditional route, and show how focusing on high quality multi-view depth prediction leads to highly accurate 3D reconstructions using simple off-the-shelf depth fusion. We propose a simple state-of-the-art multi-view depth estimator with two main contributions: 1) a carefully-designed 2D CNN which utilizes strong image priors alongside a plane-sweep feature volume and geometric losses, combined with 2) the integration of keyframe and geometric metadata into the cost volume which allows informed depth plane scoring. Our method achieves a significant lead over the current state-of-the-art for depth estimation and close or better for 3D reconstruction on ScanNet and 7-Scenes, yet still allows for online real-time low-memory reconstruction.

- **Summary**: The classification of electroencephalography (EEG) signals is useful in a wide range of applications such as seizure detection/prediction, motor imagery classification, emotion classification and drug effects diagnosis, amongst others. With the large number of EEG channels acquired, it has become vital that efficient data-reduction methods are developed, with varying importance from one application to another. It is also important that online classification is achieved during EEG recording for many applications, to monitor changes as they happen. In this paper we introduce a method based on Mutual Information (MI), for channel selection. Obtained results show that whilst there is a penalty on classification accuracy scores, promising speed-up gains can be achieved using MI techniques. Using MI with signal epochs (3secs) containing signal transitions enhances these speed-up gains. This work is exploratory and we suggest further research to be carried out for validation and development. Benefits to improving classification speed include improving application in clinical or educational settings.

- **Summary**: In this work we propose a new paradigm for designing efficient deep unrolling networks using dimensionality reduction schemes, including minibatch gradient approximation and operator sketching. The deep unrolling networks are currently the state-of-the-art solutions for imaging inverse problems. However, for high-dimensional imaging tasks, especially X-ray CT and MRI imaging, the deep unrolling schemes typically become inefficient both in terms of memory and computation, due to the need of computing multiple times the high-dimensional forward and adjoint operators. Recently researchers have found that such limitations can be partially addressed by unrolling the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), inspired by the success of stochastic first-order optimization. In this work, we explore further this direction and propose first a more expressive and practical stochastic primal-dual unrolling, based on the state-of-the-art Learned Primal-Dual (LPD) network, and also a further acceleration upon stochastic primal-dual unrolling, using sketching techniques to approximate products in the high-dimensional image space. The operator sketching can be jointly applied with stochastic unrolling for the best acceleration and compression performance. Our numerical experiments on X-ray CT image reconstruction demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our accelerated unrolling schemes.

- **Summary**: Capturing both local and global features of irregular point clouds is essential to 3D object detection (3OD). However, mainstream 3D detectors, e.g., VoteNet and its variants, either abandon considerable local features during pooling operations or ignore many global features in the whole scene context. This paper explores new modules to simultaneously learn local-global features of scene point clouds that serve 3OD positively. To this end, we propose an effective 3OD network via simultaneous local-global feature learning (dubbed 3DLG-Detector). 3DLG-Detector has two key contributions. First, it develops a Dynamic Points Interaction (DPI) module that preserves effective local features during pooling. Besides, DPI is detachable and can be incorporated into existing 3OD networks to boost their performance. Second, it develops a Global Context Aggregation module to aggregate multi-scale features from different layers of the encoder to achieve scene context-awareness. Our method shows improvements over thirteen competitors in terms of detection accuracy and robustness on both the SUN RGB-D and ScanNet datasets. Source code will be available upon publication.

We present PyTorch Image Quality (PIQ), a usability-centric library that contains the most popular modern IQA algorithms, guaranteed to be correctly implemented according to their original propositions and thoroughly verified. In this paper, we detail the principles behind the foundation of the library, describe the evaluation strategy that makes it reliable, provide the benchmarks that showcase the performance-time trade-offs, and underline the benefits of GPU acceleration given the library is used within the PyTorch backend.

- **Summary**: There is a constant need for high-performing and computationally efficient neural network models for image super-resolution (SR) often used on low-capacity devices. One way to obtain such models is to compress existing architectures, e.g. quantization. Another option is a neural architecture search (NAS) that discovers new efficient solutions. We propose a novel quantization-aware NAS procedure for a specifically designed SR search space. Our approach performs NAS to find quantization-friendly SR models. The search relies on adding quantization noise to parameters and activations instead of quantizing parameters directly. Our QuantNAS finds architectures with better PSNR/BitOps trade-off than uniform or mixed precision quantization of fixed architectures. Additionally, our search against noise procedure is up to 30% faster than directly quantizing weights.

- **Summary**: In group activity recognition, hierarchical framework is widely adopted to represent the relationships between individuals and their corresponding group, and has achieved promising performance. However, the existing methods simply employed max/average pooling in this framework, which ignored the distinct contributions of different individuals to the group activity recognition. In this paper, we propose a new contextual pooling scheme, named attentive pooling, which enables the weighted information transition from individual actions to group activity. By utilizing the attention mechanism, the attentive pooling is intrinsically interpretable and able to embed member context into the existing hierarchical model. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, two specific attentive pooling methods, i.e., global attentive pooling (GAP) and hierarchical attentive pooling (HAP) are designed. GAP rewards the individuals that are significant to group activity, while HAP further considers the hierarchical division by introducing subgroup structure. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our proposal is significantly superior beyond the baseline and is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Modeling the human body in a canonical space is a common practice for capturing and animation. But when involving the neural radiance field (NeRF), learning a static NeRF in the canonical space is not enough because the lighting of the body changes when the person moves even though the scene lighting is constant. Previous methods alleviate the inconsistency of lighting by learning a per-frame embedding, but this operation does not generalize to unseen poses. Given that the lighting condition is static in the world space while the human body is consistent in the canonical space, we propose a dual-space NeRF that models the scene lighting and the human body with two MLPs in two separate spaces. To bridge these two spaces, previous methods mostly rely on the linear blend skinning (LBS) algorithm. However, the blending weights for LBS of a dynamic neural field are intractable and thus are usually memorized with another MLP, which does not generalize to novel poses. Although it is possible to borrow the blending weights of a parametric mesh such as SMPL, the interpolation operation introduces more artifacts. In this paper, we propose to use the barycentric mapping, which can directly generalize to unseen poses and surprisingly achieves superior results than LBS with neural blending weights. Quantitative and qualitative results on the Human3.6M and the ZJU-MoCap datasets show the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) aims to predict both action category and temporal boundary of action instances in untrimmed videos, i.e., start and end time. Fully-supervised solutions are usually adopted in most existing works, and proven to be effective. One of the practical bottlenecks in these solutions is the large amount of labeled training data required. To reduce expensive human label cost, this paper focuses on a rarely investigated yet practical task named semi-supervised TAL and proposes an effective active learning method, named AL-STAL. We leverage four steps for actively selecting video samples with high informativeness and training the localization model, named \emph{Train, Query, Annotate, Append}. Two scoring functions that consider the uncertainty of localization model are equipped in AL-STAL, thus facilitating the video sample rank and selection. One takes entropy of predicted label distribution as measure of uncertainty, named Temporal Proposal Entropy (TPE). And the other introduces a new metric based on mutual information between adjacent action proposals and evaluates the informativeness of video samples, named Temporal Context Inconsistency (TCI). To validate the effectiveness of proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet 1.3. Experiment results show that AL-STAL outperforms the existing competitors and achieves satisfying performance compared with fully-supervised learning.

- **Summary**: We present a novel method of learning style-agnostic representation using both style transfer and adversarial learning in the reinforcement learning framework. The style, here, refers to task-irrelevant details such as the color of the background in the images, where generalizing the learned policy across environments with different styles is still a challenge. Focusing on learning style-agnostic representations, our method trains the actor with diverse image styles generated from an inherent adversarial style perturbation generator, which plays a min-max game between the actor and the generator, without demanding expert knowledge for data augmentation or additional class labels for adversarial training. We verify that our method achieves competitive or better performances than the state-of-the-art approaches on Procgen and Distracting Control Suite benchmarks, and further investigate the features extracted from our model, showing that the model better captures the invariants and is less distracted by the shifted style. The code is available at https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/style-agnostic-RL.

- **Summary**: To improve the purity of coal and prevent damage to the coal mining machine, it is necessary to identify coal and rock in underground coal mines. At the same time, the mined coal needs to be purified to remove rock and gangue. These two procedures are manually operated by workers in most coal mines. The realization of automatic identification and purification is not only conducive to the automation of coal mines, but also ensures the safety of workers. We discuss the possibility of using image-based methods to distinguish them. In order to find a solution that can be used in both scenarios, a model that forwards image feature extracted by DenseNet to Gaussian process is proposed, which is trained on images taken on surface and achieves high accuracy on images taken underground. This indicates our method is powerful in few-shot learning such as identification of coal and rock/gangue and might be beneficial for realizing automation in coal mines.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal MR imaging is routinely used in clinical practice to diagnose and investigate brain tumors by providing rich complementary information. Previous multi-modal MRI segmentation methods usually perform modal fusion by concatenating multi-modal MRIs at an early/middle stage of the network, which hardly explores non-linear dependencies between modalities. In this work, we propose a novel Nested Modality-Aware Transformer (NestedFormer) to explicitly explore the intra-modality and inter-modality relationships of multi-modal MRIs for brain tumor segmentation. Built on the transformer-based multi-encoder and single-decoder structure, we perform nested multi-modal fusion for high-level representations of different modalities and apply modality-sensitive gating (MSG) at lower scales for more effective skip connections. Specifically, the multi-modal fusion is conducted in our proposed Nested Modality-aware Feature Aggregation (NMaFA) module, which enhances long-term dependencies within individual modalities via a tri-orientated spatial-attention transformer, and further complements key contextual information among modalities via a cross-modality attention transformer. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 benchmark and a private meningiomas segmentation (MeniSeg) dataset show that the NestedFormer clearly outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: This paper studies the multimedia problem of temporal sentence grounding (TSG), which aims to accurately determine the specific video segment in an untrimmed video according to a given sentence query. Traditional TSG methods mainly follow the top-down or bottom-up framework and are not end-to-end. They severely rely on time-consuming post-processing to refine the grounding results. Recently, some transformer-based approaches are proposed to efficiently and effectively model the fine-grained semantic alignment between video and query. Although these methods achieve significant performance to some extent, they equally take frames of the video and words of the query as transformer input for correlating, failing to capture their different levels of granularity with distinct semantics. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Local-Global Transformer (HLGT) to leverage this hierarchy information and model the interactions between different levels of granularity and different modalities for learning more fine-grained multi-modal representations. Specifically, we first split the video and query into individual clips and phrases to learn their local context (adjacent dependency) and global correlation (long-range dependency) via a temporal transformer. Then, a global-local transformer is introduced to learn the interactions between the local-level and global-level semantics for better multi-modal reasoning. Besides, we develop a new cross-modal cycle-consistency loss to enforce interaction between two modalities and encourage the semantic alignment between them. Finally, we design a brand-new cross-modal parallel transformer decoder to integrate the encoded visual and textual features for final grounding. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets show that our proposed HLGT achieves a new state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised hashing has attracted much attention for binary representation learning due to the requirement of economical storage and efficiency of binary codes. It aims to encode high-dimensional features in the Hamming space with similarity preservation between instances. However, most existing methods learn hash functions in manifold-based approaches. Those methods capture the local geometric structures (i.e., pairwise relationships) of data, and lack satisfactory performance in dealing with real-world scenarios that produce similar features (e.g. color and shape) with different semantic information. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose an effective unsupervised method, namely Jointly Personalized Sparse Hashing (JPSH), for binary representation learning. To be specific, firstly, we propose a novel personalized hashing module, i.e., Personalized Sparse Hashing (PSH). Different personalized subspaces are constructed to reflect category-specific attributes for different clusters, adaptively mapping instances within the same cluster to the same Hamming space. In addition, we deploy sparse constraints for different personalized subspaces to select important features. We also collect the strengths of the other clusters to build the PSH module with avoiding over-fitting. Then, to simultaneously preserve semantic and pairwise similarities in our JPSH, we incorporate the PSH and manifold-based hash learning into the seamless formulation. As such, JPSH not only distinguishes the instances from different clusters, but also preserves local neighborhood structures within the cluster. Finally, an alternating optimization algorithm is adopted to iteratively capture analytical solutions of the JPSH model. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify that the JPSH outperforms several hashing algorithms on the similarity search task.

- **Summary**: Recent deep learning approaches in table detection achieved outstanding performance and proved to be effective in identifying document layouts. Currently, available table detection benchmarks have many limitations, including the lack of samples diversity, simple table structure, the lack of training cases, and samples quality. In this paper, we introduce a diverse large-scale dataset for table detection with more than seven thousand samples containing a wide variety of table structures collected from many diverse sources. In addition to that, we also present baseline results using a convolutional neural network-based method to detect table structure in documents. Experimental results show the superiority of applying convolutional deep learning methods over classical computer vision-based methods. The introduction of this diverse table detection dataset will enable the community to develop high throughput deep learning methods for understanding document layout and tabular data processing.

- **Summary**: Most unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods assume that labeled source images are available during model adaptation. However, this assumption is often infeasible owing to confidentiality issues or memory constraints on mobile devices. Some recently developed approaches do not require source images during adaptation, but they show limited performance on perturbed images. To address these problems, we propose a novel source-free UDA method that uses only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target images. Our method captures the aleatoric uncertainty by incorporating data augmentation and trains the feature generator with two consistency objectives. The feature generator is encouraged to learn consistent visual features away from the decision boundaries of the head classifier. Thus, the adapted model becomes more robust to image perturbations. Inspired by self-supervised learning, our method promotes inter-space alignment between the prediction space and the feature space while incorporating intra-space consistency within the feature space to reduce the domain gap between the source and target domains. We also consider epistemic uncertainty to boost the model adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on popular UDA benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed source-free method is comparable or even superior to vanilla UDA methods. Moreover, the adapted models show more robust results when input images are perturbed.

- **Summary**: Existing techniques for image-to-image translation commonly have suffered from two critical problems: heavy reliance on per-sample domain annotation and/or inability of handling multiple attributes per image. Recent truly-unsupervised methods adopt clustering approaches to easily provide per-sample one-hot domain labels. However, they cannot account for the real-world setting: one sample may have multiple attributes. In addition, the semantics of the clusters are not easily coupled to the human understanding. To overcome these, we present a LANguage-driven Image-to-image Translation model, dubbed LANIT. We leverage easy-to-obtain candidate attributes given in texts for a dataset: the similarity between images and attributes indicates per-sample domain labels. This formulation naturally enables multi-hot label so that users can specify the target domain with a set of attributes in language. To account for the case that the initial prompts are inaccurate, we also present prompt learning. We further present domain regularization loss that enforces translated images be mapped to the corresponding domain. Experiments on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that LANIT achieves comparable or superior performance to existing models.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration aims at estimating the geometric transformation between two point cloud scans, in which point-wise correspondence estimation is the key to its success. In addition to previous methods that seek correspondences by hand-crafted or learnt geometric features, recent point cloud registration methods have tried to apply RGB-D data to achieve more accurate correspondence. However, it is not trivial to effectively fuse the geometric and visual information from these two distinctive modalities, especially for the registration problem. In this work, we propose a new Geometry-Aware Visual Feature Extractor (GAVE) that employs multi-scale local linear transformation to progressively fuse these two modalities, where the geometric features from the depth data act as the geometry-dependent convolution kernels to transform the visual features from the RGB data. The resultant visual-geometric features are in canonical feature spaces with alleviated visual dissimilarity caused by geometric changes, by which more reliable correspondence can be achieved. The proposed GAVE module can be readily plugged into recent RGB-D point cloud registration framework. Extensive experiments on 3D Match and ScanNet demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud registration methods even without correspondence or pose supervision.

- **Summary**: A plethora of deep-neural-networks (DNN) based methods were proposed over the past few years to address the challenging ill-posed inverse problem of MRI reconstruction from undersampled "k-space" (Fourier domain) data. However, instability against variations in the acquisition process and the anatomical distribution, indicates a poor generalization of the relevant physical models by the DNN architectures compared to their classical counterparts. The poor generalization effectively precludes DNN applicability for undersampled MRI reconstruction in the clinical setting. We improve the generalization capacity of DNN methods for undersampled MRI reconstruction by introducing a physically-primed DNN architecture and training approach. Our architecture encodes the undersampling mask in addition to the observed data in the model architecture and employs an appropriate training approach that uses data generated with various undersampling masks to encourage the model to generalize the undersampled MRI reconstruction problem. We demonstrated the added-value of our approach through extensive experimentation with the publicly available Fast-MRI dataset. Our physically-primed approach achieved an enhanced generalization capacity which resulted in significantly improved robustness against variations in the acquisition process and in the anatomical distribution, especially in pathological regions, compared to both vanilla DNN methods and DNN trained with undersampling mask augmentation. Trained models and code to replicate our experiments will become available for research purposes upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: The use of Environmental Microorganisms (EMs) offers a highly efficient, low cost and harmless remedy to environmental pollution, by monitoring and decomposing of pollutants. This relies on how the EMs are correctly segmented and identified. With the aim of enhancing the segmentation of weakly visible EM images which are transparent, noisy and have low contrast, a Pairwise Deep Learning Feature Network (PDLF-Net) is proposed in this study. The use of PDLFs enables the network to focus more on the foreground (EMs) by concatenating the pairwise deep learning features of each image to different blocks of the base model SegNet. Leveraging the Shi and Tomas descriptors, we extract each image's deep features on the patches, which are centered at each descriptor using the VGG-16 model. Then, to learn the intermediate characteristics between the descriptors, pairing of the features is performed based on the Delaunay triangulation theorem to form pairwise deep learning features. In this experiment, the PDLF-Net achieves outstanding segmentation results of 89.24%, 63.20%, 77.27%, 35.15%, 89.72%, 91.44% and 89.30% on the accuracy, IoU, Dice, VOE, sensitivity, precision and specificity, respectively.

- **Summary**: A considerable amount of research is concerned with the generation of realistic sensor data. LiDAR point clouds are generated by complex simulations or learned generative models. The generated data is usually exploited to enable or improve downstream perception algorithms. Two major questions arise from these procedures: First, how to evaluate the realism of the generated data? Second, does more realistic data also lead to better perception performance? This paper addresses both questions and presents a novel metric to quantify the realism of LiDAR point clouds. Relevant features are learned from real-world and synthetic point clouds by training on a proxy classification task. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the application of our metric to determine the realism of generated LiDAR data and compare the realism estimation of our metric to the performance of a segmentation model. We confirm that our metric provides an indication for the downstream segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Human motion modeling is important for many modern graphics applications, which typically require professional skills. In order to remove the skill barriers for laymen, recent motion generation methods can directly generate human motions conditioned on natural languages. However, it remains challenging to achieve diverse and fine-grained motion generation with various text inputs. To address this problem, we propose MotionDiffuse, the first diffusion model-based text-driven motion generation framework, which demonstrates several desired properties over existing methods. 1) Probabilistic Mapping. Instead of a deterministic language-motion mapping, MotionDiffuse generates motions through a series of denoising steps in which variations are injected. 2) Realistic Synthesis. MotionDiffuse excels at modeling complicated data distribution and generating vivid motion sequences. 3) Multi-Level Manipulation. MotionDiffuse responds to fine-grained instructions on body parts, and arbitrary-length motion synthesis with time-varied text prompts. Our experiments show MotionDiffuse outperforms existing SoTA methods by convincing margins on text-driven motion generation and action-conditioned motion generation. A qualitative analysis further demonstrates MotionDiffuse's controllability for comprehensive motion generation. Homepage: https://mingyuan-zhang.github.io/projects/MotionDiffuse.html

- **Summary**: Predicting the possible future trajectories of the surrounding dynamic agents is an essential requirement in autonomous driving. These trajectories mainly depend on the surrounding static environment, as well as the past movements of those dynamic agents. Furthermore, the multimodal nature of agent intentions makes the trajectory prediction problem more challenging. All of the existing models consider the target agent as well as the surrounding agents similarly, without considering the variation of physical properties. In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning based framework for multimodal trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, which considers the physical properties of the target and surrounding vehicles such as the object class and their physical dimensions through a weighted attention module, that improves the accuracy of the predictions. Our model has achieved the highest results in the nuScenes trajectory prediction benchmark, out of the models which use rasterized maps to input environment information. Furthermore, our model is able to run in real-time, achieving a high inference rate of over 300 FPS.

- **Summary**: Current self-supervised approaches for skeleton action representation learning often focus on constrained scenarios, where videos and skeleton data are recorded in laboratory settings. When dealing with estimated skeleton data in real-world videos, such methods perform poorly due to the large variations across subjects and camera viewpoints. To address this issue, we introduce ViA, a novel View-Invariant Autoencoder for self-supervised skeleton action representation learning. ViA leverages motion retargeting between different human performers as a pretext task, in order to disentangle the latent action-specific `Motion' features on top of the visual representation of a 2D or 3D skeleton sequence. Such `Motion' features are invariant to skeleton geometry and camera view and allow ViA to facilitate both, cross-subject and cross-view action classification tasks. We conduct a study focusing on transfer-learning for skeleton-based action recognition with self-supervised pre-training on real-world data (e.g., Posetics). Our results showcase that skeleton representations learned from ViA are generic enough to improve upon state-of-the-art action classification accuracy, not only on 3D laboratory datasets such as NTU-RGB+D 60 and NTU-RGB+D 120, but also on real-world datasets where only 2D data are accurately estimated, e.g., Toyota Smarthome, UAV-Human and Penn Action.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate a new optimization framework for multi-view 3D shape reconstructions. Recent differentiable rendering approaches have provided breakthrough performances with implicit shape representations though they can still lack precision in the estimated geometries. On the other hand multi-view stereo methods can yield pixel wise geometric accuracy with local depth predictions along viewing rays. Our approach bridges the gap between the two strategies with a novel volumetric shape representation that is implicit but parameterized with pixel depths to better materialize the shape surface with consistent signed distances along viewing rays. The approach retains pixel-accuracy while benefiting from volumetric integration in the optimization. To this aim, depths are optimized by evaluating, at each 3D location within the volumetric discretization, the agreement between the depth prediction consistency and the photometric consistency for the corresponding pixels. The optimization is agnostic to the associated photo-consistency term which can vary from a median-based baseline to more elaborate criteria learned functions. Our experiments demonstrate the benefit of the volumetric integration with depth predictions. They also show that our approach outperforms existing approaches over standard 3D benchmarks with better geometry estimations.

- **Summary**: Due to the imbalanced and limited data, semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods often fail to produce superior performance for some specific tailed classes. Inadequate training for those particular classes could introduce more noise to the generated pseudo labels, affecting overall learning. To alleviate this shortcoming and identify the under-performing classes, we propose maintaining a confidence array that records class-wise performance during training. A fuzzy fusion of these confidence scores is proposed to adaptively prioritize individual confidence metrics in every sample rather than traditional ensemble approaches, where a set of predefined fixed weights are assigned for all the test cases. Further, we introduce a robust class-wise sampling method and dynamic stabilization for a better training strategy. Our proposed method considers all the under-performing classes with dynamic weighting and tries to remove most of the noises during training. Upon evaluation on two cardiac MRI datasets, ACDC and MMWHS, our proposed method shows effectiveness and generalizability and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods found in the literature.

- **Summary**: Learning to detect objects, such as humans, in imagery captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) usually suffers from tremendous variations caused by the UAV's position towards the objects. In addition, existing UAV-based benchmark datasets do not provide adequate dataset metadata, which is essential for precise model diagnosis and learning features invariant to those variations. In this paper, we introduce Archangel, the first UAV-based object detection dataset composed of real and synthetic subsets captured with similar imagining conditions and UAV position and object pose metadata. A series of experiments are carefully designed with a state-of-the-art object detector to demonstrate the benefits of leveraging the metadata during model evaluation. Moreover, several crucial insights involving both real and synthetic data during model optimization are presented. In the end, we discuss the advantages, limitations, and future directions regarding Archangel to highlight its distinct value for the broader machine learning community.
