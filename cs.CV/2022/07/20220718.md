- **Summary**: The ability to process environment maps across multiple sessions is critical for robots operating over extended periods of time. Specifically, it is desirable for autonomous agents to detect changes amongst maps of different sessions so as to gain a conflict-free understanding of the current environment. In this paper, we look into the problem of change detection based on a novel map representation, dubbed Plane Signed Distance Fields (PlaneSDF), where dense maps are represented as a collection of planes and their associated geometric components in SDF volumes. Given point clouds of the source and target scenes, we propose a three-step PlaneSDF-based change detection approach: (1) PlaneSDF volumes are instantiated within each scene and registered across scenes using plane poses; 2D height maps and object maps are extracted per volume via height projection and connected component analysis. (2) Height maps are compared and intersected with the object map to produce a 2D change location mask for changed object candidates in the source scene. (3) 3D geometric validation is performed using SDF-derived features per object candidate for change mask refinement. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via the task of changed object detection. Supplementary video: https://youtu.be/oh-MQPWTwZI

- **Summary**: As computer vision and NLP make progress, Vision-Language(VL) is becoming an important area of research. Despite the importance, evaluation metrics of the research domain is still at a preliminary stage of development. In this paper, we propose a quantitative metric "Equivariance Score" and evaluation dataset "Human Puzzle" to assess whether a VL model is understanding an image like a human. We observed that the VL model does not interpret the overall context of an input image but instead shows biases toward a specific object or shape that forms the local context. We aim to quantitatively measure a model's performance in understanding context. To verify the current existing VL model's capability, we sliced the original input image into pieces and randomly placed them, distorting the global context of the image. Our paper discusses each VL model's level of interpretation on global context and addresses how the structural characteristics influenced the results.

- **Summary**: Realizing the potential of neural video codecs on mobile devices is a big technological challenge due to the computational complexity of deep networks and the power-constrained mobile hardware. We demonstrate practical feasibility by leveraging Qualcomm's technology and innovation, bridging the gap from neural network-based codec simulations running on wall-powered workstations, to real-time operation on a mobile device powered by Snapdragon technology. We show the first-ever inter-frame neural video decoder running on a commercial mobile phone, decoding high-definition videos in real-time while maintaining a low bitrate and high visual quality.

- **Summary**: The rotation search problem aims to find a 3D rotation that best aligns a given number of point pairs. To induce robustness against outliers for rotation search, prior work considers truncated least-squares (TLS), which is a non-convex optimization problem, and its semidefinite relaxation (SDR) as a tractable alternative. Whether this SDR is theoretically tight in the presence of noise, outliers, or both has remained largely unexplored. We derive conditions that characterize the tightness of this SDR, showing that the tightness depends on the noise level, the truncation parameters of TLS, and the outlier distribution (random or clustered). In particular, we give a short proof for the tightness in the noiseless and outlier-free case, as opposed to the lengthy analysis of prior work.

- **Summary**: Image-adaptive lookup tables (LUTs) have achieved great success in real-time image enhancement tasks due to their high efficiency for modeling color transforms. However, they embed the complete transform, including the color component-independent and the component-correlated parts, into only a single type of LUTs, either 1D or 3D, in a coupled manner. This scheme raises a dilemma of improving model expressiveness or efficiency due to two factors. On the one hand, the 1D LUTs provide high computational efficiency but lack the critical capability of color components interaction. On the other, the 3D LUTs present enhanced component-correlated transform capability but suffer from heavy memory footprint, high training difficulty, and limited cell utilization. Inspired by the conventional divide-and-conquer practice in the image signal processor, we present SepLUT (separable image-adaptive lookup table) to tackle the above limitations. Specifically, we separate a single color transform into a cascade of component-independent and component-correlated sub-transforms instantiated as 1D and 3D LUTs, respectively. In this way, the capabilities of two sub-transforms can facilitate each other, where the 3D LUT complements the ability to mix up color components, and the 1D LUT redistributes the input colors to increase the cell utilization of the 3D LUT and thus enable the use of a more lightweight 3D LUT. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method presents enhanced performance on photo retouching benchmark datasets than the current state-of-the-art and achieves real-time processing on both GPUs and CPUs.

- **Summary**: We propose a method to detect individualized highlights for users on given target videos based on their preferred highlight clips marked on previous videos they have watched. Our method explicitly leverages the contents of both the preferred clips and the target videos using pre-trained features for the objects and the human activities. We design a multi-head attention mechanism to adaptively weigh the preferred clips based on their object- and human-activity-based contents, and fuse them using these weights into a single feature representation for each user. We compute similarities between these per-user feature representations and the per-frame features computed from the desired target videos to estimate the user-specific highlight clips from the target videos. We test our method on a large-scale highlight detection dataset containing the annotated highlights of individual users. Compared to current baselines, we observe an absolute improvement of 2-4% in the mean average precision of the detected highlights. We also perform extensive ablation experiments on the number of preferred highlight clips associated with each user as well as on the object- and human-activity-based feature representations to validate that our method is indeed both content-based and user-specific.



### Learning Knowledge Representation with Meta Knowledge Distillation for Single Image Super-Resolution

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD), which can efficiently transfer knowledge from a cumbersome network (teacher) to a compact network (student), has demonstrated its advantages in some computer vision applications. The representation of knowledge is vital for knowledge transferring and student learning, which is generally defined in hand-crafted manners or uses the intermediate features directly. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic meta knowledge distillation method under the teacher-student architecture for the single image super-resolution task. It provides a more flexible and accurate way to help the teachers transmit knowledge in accordance with the abilities of students via knowledge representation networks (KRNets) with learnable parameters. In order to improve the perception ability of knowledge representation to students' requirements, we propose to solve the transformation process from intermediate outputs to transferred knowledge by employing the student features and the correlation between teacher and student in the KRNets. Specifically, the texture-aware dynamic kernels are generated and then extract texture features to be improved and the corresponding teacher guidance so as to decompose the distillation problem into texture-wise supervision for further promoting the recovery quality of high-frequency details. In addition, the KRNets are optimized in a meta-learning manner to ensure the knowledge transferring and the student learning are beneficial to improving the reconstructed quality of the student. Experiments conducted on various single image super-resolution datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing defined knowledge representation related distillation methods, and can help super-resolution algorithms achieve better reconstruction quality without introducing any inference complexity.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a simple method for speech videos generation based on audio: given a piece of audio, we can generate a video of the target face speaking this audio. We propose Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with cut speech audio input as condition and use Convolutional Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) in generator and discriminator. Our model is trained by exploiting the short audio and the frames in this duration. For training, we cut the audio and extract the face in the corresponding frames. We designed a simple encoder and compare the generated frames using GAN with and without GRU. We use GRU for temporally coherent frames and the results show that short audio can produce relatively realistic output results.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning (CL) has recently been applied to adversarial learning tasks. Such practice considers adversarial samples as additional positive views of an instance, and by maximizing their agreements with each other, yields better adversarial robustness. However, this mechanism can be potentially flawed, since adversarial perturbations may cause instance-level identity confusion, which can impede CL performance by pulling together different instances with separate identities. To address this issue, we propose to treat adversarial samples unequally when contrasted, with an asymmetric InfoNCE objective ($A-InfoNCE$) that allows discriminating considerations of adversarial samples. Specifically, adversaries are viewed as inferior positives that induce weaker learning signals, or as hard negatives exhibiting higher contrast to other negative samples. In the asymmetric fashion, the adverse impacts of conflicting objectives between CL and adversarial learning can be effectively mitigated. Experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms existing Adversarial CL methods across different finetuning schemes without additional computational cost. The proposed A-InfoNCE is also a generic form that can be readily extended to other CL methods. Code is available at https://github.com/yqy2001/A-InfoNCE.

- **Summary**: Realistic fake videos are a potential tool for spreading harmful misinformation given our increasing online presence and information intake. This paper presents a multimodal learning-based method for detection of real and fake videos. The method combines information from three modalities - audio, video, and physiology. We investigate two strategies for combining the video and physiology modalities, either by augmenting the video with information from the physiology or by novelly learning the fusion of those two modalities with a proposed Graph Convolutional Network architecture. Both strategies for combining the two modalities rely on a novel method for generation of visual representations of physiological signals. The detection of real and fake videos is then based on the dissimilarity between the audio and modified video modalities. The proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets and the results show significant increase in detection performance compared to previous methods.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised Referring Expression Grounding (REG) aims to ground a particular target in an image described by a language expression while lacking the correspondence between target and expression. Two main problems exist in weakly supervised REG. First, the lack of region-level annotations introduces ambiguities between proposals and queries. Second, most previous weakly supervised REG methods ignore the discriminative location and context of the referent, causing difficulties in distinguishing the target from other same-category objects. To address the above challenges, we design an entity-enhanced adaptive reconstruction network (EARN). Specifically, EARN includes three modules: entity enhancement, adaptive grounding, and collaborative reconstruction. In entity enhancement, we calculate semantic similarity as supervision to select the candidate proposals. Adaptive grounding calculates the ranking score of candidate proposals upon subject, location and context with hierarchical attention. Collaborative reconstruction measures the ranking result from three perspectives: adaptive reconstruction, language reconstruction and attribute classification. The adaptive mechanism helps to alleviate the variance of different referring expressions. Experiments on five datasets show EARN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed EARN can better handle the situation where multiple objects of a particular category are situated together.



### A Semantic-aware Attention and Visual Shielding Network for Cloth-changing Person Re-identification

- **Summary**: Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that aims to retrieve pedestrians whose clothes are changed. Since the human appearance with different clothes exhibits large variations, it is very difficult for existing approaches to extract discriminative and robust feature representations. Current works mainly focus on body shape or contour sketches, but the human semantic information and the potential consistency of pedestrian features before and after changing clothes are not fully explored or are ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel semantic-aware attention and visual shielding network for cloth-changing person ReID (abbreviated as SAVS) is proposed where the key idea is to shield clues related to the appearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not sensitive to view/posture changes. Specifically, a visual semantic encoder is first employed to locate the human body and clothing regions based on human semantic segmentation information. Then, a human semantic attention module (HSA) is proposed to highlight the human semantic information and reweight the visual feature map. In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is also designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the cloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on the visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly, these two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted for cloth-changing persons. Compared with FSAM (published in CVPR 2021), this method can achieve improvements of 32.7% (16.5%) and 14.9% (-) on the LTCC and PRCC datasets in terms of mAP (rank-1), respectively.

- **Summary**: Unrolled neural networks have recently achieved state-of-the-art accelerated MRI reconstruction. These networks unroll iterative optimization algorithms by alternating between physics-based consistency and neural-network based regularization. However, they require several iterations of a large neural network to handle high-dimensional imaging tasks such as 3D MRI. This limits traditional training algorithms based on backpropagation due to prohibitively large memory and compute requirements for calculating gradients and storing intermediate activations. To address this challenge, we propose Greedy LEarning for Accelerated MRI (GLEAM) reconstruction, an efficient training strategy for high-dimensional imaging settings. GLEAM splits the end-to-end network into decoupled network modules. Each module is optimized in a greedy manner with decoupled gradient updates, reducing the memory footprint during training. We show that the decoupled gradient updates can be performed in parallel on multiple graphical processing units (GPUs) to further reduce training time. We present experiments with 2D and 3D datasets including multi-coil knee, brain, and dynamic cardiac cine MRI. We observe that: i) GLEAM generalizes as well as state-of-the-art memory-efficient baselines such as gradient checkpointing and invertible networks with the same memory footprint, but with 1.3x faster training; ii) for the same memory footprint, GLEAM yields 1.1dB PSNR gain in 2D and 1.8 dB in 3D over end-to-end baselines.

- **Summary**: Partial occlusion effects are a phenomenon that blurry objects near a camera are semi-transparent, resulting in partial appearance of occluded background. However, it is challenging for existing bokeh rendering methods to simulate realistic partial occlusion effects due to the missing information of the occluded area in an all-in-focus image. Inspired by the learnable 3D scene representation, Multiplane Image (MPI), we attempt to address the partial occlusion by introducing a novel MPI-based high-resolution bokeh rendering framework, termed MPIB. To this end, we first present an analysis on how to apply the MPI representation to bokeh rendering. Based on this analysis, we propose an MPI representation module combined with a background inpainting module to implement high-resolution scene representation. This representation can then be reused to render various bokeh effects according to the controlling parameters. To train and test our model, we also design a ray-tracing-based bokeh generator for data generation. Extensive experiments on synthesized and real-world images validate the effectiveness and flexibility of this framework.

- **Summary**: CutMix is a popular augmentation technique commonly used for training modern convolutional and transformer vision networks. It was originally designed to encourage Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to focus more on an image's global context instead of local information, which greatly improves the performance of CNNs. However, we found it to have limited benefits for transformer-based architectures that naturally have a global receptive field. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation technique TokenMix to improve the performance of vision transformers. TokenMix mixes two images at token level via partitioning the mixing region into multiple separated parts. Besides, we show that the mixed learning target in CutMix, a linear combination of a pair of the ground truth labels, might be inaccurate and sometimes counter-intuitive. To obtain a more suitable target, we propose to assign the target score according to the content-based neural activation maps of the two images from a pre-trained teacher model, which does not need to have high performance. With plenty of experiments on various vision transformer architectures, we show that our proposed TokenMix helps vision transformers focus on the foreground area to infer the classes and enhances their robustness to occlusion, with consistent performance gains. Notably, we improve DeiT-T/S/B with +1% ImageNet top-1 accuracy. Besides, TokenMix enjoys longer training, which achieves 81.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with DeiT-S trained for 400 epochs.

- **Summary**: We introduce FewGAN, a generative model for generating novel, high-quality and diverse images whose patch distribution lies in the joint patch distribution of a small number of N>1 training samples. The method is, in essence, a hierarchical patch-GAN that applies quantization at the first coarse scale, in a similar fashion to VQ-GAN, followed by a pyramid of residual fully convolutional GANs at finer scales. Our key idea is to first use quantization to learn a fixed set of patch embeddings for training images. We then use a separate set of side images to model the structure of generated images using an autoregressive model trained on the learned patch embeddings of training images. Using quantization at the coarsest scale allows the model to generate both conditional and unconditional novel images. Subsequently, a patch-GAN renders the fine details, resulting in high-quality images. In an extensive set of experiments, it is shown that FewGAN outperforms baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Global correlations are widely seen in human anatomical structures due to similarity across tissues and bones. These correlations are reflected in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans as a result of close-range proton density and T1/T2 parameters. Furthermore, to achieve accelerated MRI, k-space data are undersampled which causes global aliasing artifacts. Convolutional neural network (CNN) models are widely utilized for accelerated MRI reconstruction, but those models are limited in capturing global correlations due to the intrinsic locality of the convolution operation. The self-attention-based transformer models are capable of capturing global correlations among image features, however, the current contributions of transformer models for MRI reconstruction are minute. The existing contributions mostly provide CNN-transformer hybrid solutions and rarely leverage the physics of MRI. In this paper, we propose a physics-based stand-alone (convolution free) transformer model titled, the Multi-head Cascaded Swin Transformers (McSTRA) for accelerated MRI reconstruction. McSTRA combines several interconnected MRI physics-related concepts with the transformer networks: it exploits global MR features via the shifted window self-attention mechanism; it extracts MR features belonging to different spectral components separately using a multi-head setup; it iterates between intermediate de-aliasing and k-space correction via a cascaded network with data consistency in k-space and intermediate loss computations; furthermore, we propose a novel positional embedding generation mechanism to guide self-attention utilizing the point spread function corresponding to the undersampling mask. Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods both visually and quantitatively while depicting improved resolution and removal of aliasing artifacts.

- **Summary**: Video text spotting(VTS) is the task that requires simultaneously detecting, tracking and recognizing text in the video. Existing video text spotting methods typically develop sophisticated pipelines and multiple models, which is not friend for real-time applications. Here we propose a real-time end-to-end video text spotter with Contrastive Representation learning (CoText). Our contributions are three-fold: 1) CoText simultaneously address the three tasks (e.g., text detection, tracking, recognition) in a real-time end-to-end trainable framework. 2) With contrastive learning, CoText models long-range dependencies and learning temporal information across multiple frames. 3) A simple, lightweight architecture is designed for effective and accurate performance, including GPU-parallel detection post-processing, CTC-based recognition head with Masked RoI. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method. Especially, CoText achieves an video text spotting IDF1 of 72.0% at 41.0 FPS on ICDAR2015video, with 10.5% and 32.0 FPS improvement the previous best method.

- **Summary**: The detector-free feature matching approaches are currently attracting great attention thanks to their excellent performance. However, these methods still struggle at large-scale and viewpoint variations, due to the geometric inconsistency resulting from the application of the mutual nearest neighbour criterion (\ie, one-to-one assignment) in patch-level matching.Accordingly, we introduce AdaMatcher, which first accomplishes the feature correlation and co-visible area estimation through an elaborate feature interaction module, then performs adaptive assignment on patch-level matching while estimating the scales between images, and finally refines the co-visible matches through scale alignment and sub-pixel regression module.Extensive experiments show that AdaMatcher outperforms solid baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on many downstream tasks. Additionally, the adaptive assignment and sub-pixel refinement module can be used as a refinement network for other matching methods, such as SuperGlue, to boost their performance further. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/AbyssGaze/AdaMatcher.

- **Summary**: Image datasets have been steadily growing in size, harming the feasibility and efficiency of large-scale 3D reconstruction methods. In this paper, a novel approach for scaling Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms up to arbitrarily large collections of images is proposed. Specifically, the problem of reconstructing the 3D model of an entire city is targeted, starting from a set of videos acquired by a moving vehicle equipped with several high-resolution cameras. Initially, the presented method exploits an approximately uniform distribution of poses and geometry and builds a set of overlapping clusters. Then, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem is formulated for each cluster to select an optimal subset of views that guarantees both visibility and matchability. Finally, local point clouds for each cluster are separately computed and merged. Since clustering is independent from pairwise visibility information, the proposed algorithm runs faster than existing literature and allows for a massive parallelization. Extensive testing on urban data are discussed to show the effectiveness and the scalability of this approach.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a complete pipeline for image-based 3D reconstruction of urban scenarios is proposed, based on PatchMatch Multi-View Stereo (MVS). Input images are firstly fed into an off-the-shelf visual SLAM system to extract camera poses and sparse keypoints, which are used to initialize PatchMatch optimization. Then, pixelwise depths and normals are iteratively computed in a multi-scale framework with a novel depth-normal consistency loss term and a global refinement algorithm to balance the inherently local nature of PatchMatch. Finally, a large-scale point cloud is generated by back-projecting multi-view consistent estimates in 3D. The proposed approach is carefully evaluated against both classical MVS algorithms and monocular depth networks on the KITTI dataset, showing state of the art performances.

- **Summary**: Training semantic segmentation models on multiple datasets has sparked a lot of recent interest in the computer vision community. This interest has been motivated by expensive annotations and a desire to achieve proficiency across multiple visual domains. However, established datasets have mutually incompatible labels which disrupt principled inference in the wild. We address this issue by automatic construction of universal taxonomies through iterative dataset integration. Our method detects subset-superset relationships between dataset-specific labels, and supports learning of sub-class logits by treating super-classes as partial labels. We present experiments on collections of standard datasets and demonstrate competitive generalization performance with respect to previous work.

- **Summary**: To bridge the gap between supervised semantic segmentation and real-world applications that acquires one model to recognize arbitrary new concepts, recent zero-shot segmentation attracts a lot of attention by exploring the relationships between unseen and seen object categories, yet requiring large amounts of densely-annotated data with diverse base classes. In this paper, we propose a new open-world semantic segmentation pipeline that makes the first attempt to learn to segment semantic objects of various open-world categories without any efforts on dense annotations, by purely exploiting the image-caption data that naturally exist on the Internet. Our method, Vision-language-driven Semantic Segmentation (ViL-Seg), employs an image and a text encoder to generate visual and text embeddings for the image-caption data, with two core components that endow its segmentation ability: First, the image encoder is jointly trained with a vision-based contrasting and a cross-modal contrasting, which encourage the visual embeddings to preserve both fine-grained semantics and high-level category information that are crucial for the segmentation task. Furthermore, an online clustering head is devised over the image encoder, which allows to dynamically segment the visual embeddings into distinct semantic groups such that they can be classified by comparing with various text embeddings to complete our segmentation pipeline. Experiments show that without using any data with dense annotations, our method can directly segment objects of arbitrary categories, outperforming zero-shot segmentation methods that require data labeling on three benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Urban region function recognition plays a vital character in monitoring and managing the limited urban areas. Since urban functions are complex and full of social-economic properties, simply using remote sensing~(RS) images equipped with physical and optical information cannot completely solve the classification task. On the other hand, with the development of mobile communication and the internet, the acquisition of geospatial big data~(GBD) becomes possible. In this paper, we propose a Multi-dimension Feature Learning Model~(MDFL) using high-dimensional GBD data in conjunction with RS images for urban region function recognition. When extracting multi-dimension features, our model considers the user-related information modeled by their activity, as well as the region-based information abstracted from the region graph. Furthermore, we propose a decision fusion network that integrates the decisions from several neural networks and machine learning classifiers, and the final decision is made considering both the visual cue from the RS images and the social information from the GBD data. Through quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our model achieves overall accuracy at 92.75, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 10 percent.

- **Summary**: Automated segmentation of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) is an essential step in neuroimaging analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR-weighted) is an MRI contrast that is particularly useful to visualize and quantify WMHs, a hallmark of cerebral small vessel disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical MRI protocols migrate to a three-dimensional (3D) FLAIR-weighted acquisition to enable high spatial resolution in all three voxel dimensions. The current study details the deployment of deep learning tools to enable automated WMH segmentation and characterization from 3D FLAIR-weighted images acquired as part of a national AD imaging initiative.   Among 441 participants (194 male, mean age: (64.91 +/- 9.32) years) from the DDI study, two in-house networks were trained and validated across five national collection sites. Three models were tested on a held-out subset of the internal data from the 441 participants and an external dataset with 29 cases from an international collaborator. These test sets were evaluated independently. Five established WMH performance metrics were used for comparison against ground truth human-in-the-loop segmentation.   Results of the three networks tested, the 3D nnU-Net had the best performance with an average dice similarity coefficient score of 0.76 +/- 0.16, performing better than both the in-house developed 2.5D model and the SOTA Deep Bayesian network.   With the increasing use of 3D FLAIR-weighted images in MRI protocols, our results suggest that WMH segmentation models can be trained on 3D data and yield WMH segmentation performance that is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art without the need for including T1-weighted image series.

- **Summary**: Optical flow is an easily conceived and precious cue for advancing unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS). Most of the previous methods directly extract and fuse the motion and appearance features for segmenting target objects in the UVOS setting. However, optical flow is intrinsically an instantaneous velocity of all pixels among consecutive frames, thus making the motion features not aligned well with the primary objects among the corresponding frames. To solve the above challenge, we propose a concise, practical, and efficient architecture for appearance and motion feature alignment, dubbed hierarchical feature alignment network (HFAN). Specifically, the key merits in HFAN are the sequential Feature AlignMent (FAM) module and the Feature AdaptaTion (FAT) module, which are leveraged for processing the appearance and motion features hierarchically. FAM is capable of aligning both appearance and motion features with the primary object semantic representations, respectively. Further, FAT is explicitly designed for the adaptive fusion of appearance and motion features to achieve a desirable trade-off between cross-modal features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HFAN, which reaches a new state-of-the-art performance on DAVIS-16, achieving 88.7 $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ Mean, i.e., a relative improvement of 3.5% over the best published result.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of compressing an information source when a correlated one is available as side information only at the decoder side, which is a special case of the distributed source coding problem in information theory. In particular, we consider a pair of stereo images, which have overlapping fields of view, and are captured by a synchronized and calibrated pair of cameras as correlated image sources. In previously proposed methods, the encoder transforms the input image to a latent representation using a deep neural network, and compresses the quantized latent representation losslessly using entropy coding. The decoder decodes the entropy-coded quantized latent representation, and reconstructs the input image using this representation and the available side information. In the proposed method, the decoder employs a cross-attention module to align the feature maps obtained from the received latent representation of the input image and a latent representation of the side information. We argue that aligning the correlated patches in the feature maps allows better utilization of the side information. We empirically demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm on KITTI and Cityscape datasets of stereo image pairs. Our experimental results show that the proposed architecture is able to exploit the decoder-only side information in a more efficient manner compared to previous works.

- **Summary**: The alignment of adjacent frames is considered an essential operation in video super-resolution (VSR). Advanced VSR models, including the latest VSR Transformers, are generally equipped with well-designed alignment modules. However, the progress of the self-attention mechanism may violate this common sense. In this paper, we rethink the role of alignment in VSR Transformers and make several counter-intuitive observations. Our experiments show that: (i) VSR Transformers can directly utilize multi-frame information from unaligned videos, and (ii) existing alignment methods are sometimes harmful to VSR Transformers. These observations indicate that we can further improve the performance of VSR Transformers simply by removing the alignment module and adopting a larger attention window. Nevertheless, such designs will dramatically increase the computational burden, and cannot deal with large motions. Therefore, we propose a new and efficient alignment method called patch alignment, which aligns image patches instead of pixels. VSR Transformers equipped with patch alignment could demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Our work provides valuable insights on how multi-frame information is used in VSR and how to select alignment methods for different networks/datasets. Codes and models will be released at https://github.com/XPixelGroup/RethinkVSRAlignment.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the consensus for medical image segmentation tasks. However, they suffer from the limitation in modeling long-range dependencies and spatial correlations due to the nature of convolution operation. Although transformers were first developed to address this issue, they fail to capture low-level features. In contrast, it is demonstrated that both local and global features are crucial for dense prediction, such as segmenting in challenging contexts. In this paper, we propose HiFormer, a novel method that efficiently bridges a CNN and a transformer for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we design two multi-scale feature representations using the seminal Swin Transformer module and a CNN-based encoder. To secure a fine fusion of global and local features obtained from the two aforementioned representations, we propose a Double-Level Fusion (DLF) module in the skip connection of the encoder-decoder structure. Extensive experiments on various medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiFormer over other CNN-based, transformer-based, and hybrid methods in terms of computational complexity, and quantitative and qualitative results.

- **Summary**: Curriculum learning needs example difficulty to proceed from easy to hard. However, the credibility of image difficulty is rarely investigated, which can seriously affect the effectiveness of curricula. In this work, we propose Angular Gap, a measure of difficulty based on the difference in angular distance between feature embeddings and class-weight embeddings built by hyperspherical learning. To ascertain difficulty estimation, we introduce class-wise model calibration, as a post-training technique, to the learnt hyperbolic space. This bridges the gap between probabilistic model calibration and angular distance estimation of hyperspherical learning. We show the superiority of our calibrated Angular Gap over recent difficulty metrics on CIFAR10-H and ImageNetV2. We further propose Angular Gap based curriculum learning for unsupervised domain adaptation that can translate from learning easy samples to mining hard samples. We combine this curriculum with a state-of-the-art self-training method, Cycle Self Training (CST). The proposed Curricular CST learns robust representations and outperforms recent baselines on Office31 and VisDA 2017.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D detection has drawn much attention from the community due to its low cost and setup simplicity. It takes an RGB image as input and predicts 3D boxes in the 3D space. The most challenging sub-task lies in the instance depth estimation. Previous works usually use a direct estimation method. However, in this paper we point out that the instance depth on the RGB image is non-intuitive. It is coupled by visual depth clues and instance attribute clues, making it hard to be directly learned in the network. Therefore, we propose to reformulate the instance depth to the combination of the instance visual surface depth (visual depth) and the instance attribute depth (attribute depth). The visual depth is related to objects' appearances and positions on the image. By contrast, the attribute depth relies on objects' inherent attributes, which are invariant to the object affine transformation on the image. Correspondingly, we decouple the 3D location uncertainty into visual depth uncertainty and attribute depth uncertainty. By combining different types of depths and associated uncertainties, we can obtain the final instance depth. Furthermore, data augmentation in monocular 3D detection is usually limited due to the physical nature, hindering the boost of performance. Based on the proposed instance depth disentanglement strategy, we can alleviate this problem. Evaluated on KITTI, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results, and extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in our method.

- **Summary**: Bird's eye view (BEV) representation is a new perception formulation for autonomous driving, which is based on spatial fusion. Further, temporal fusion is also introduced in BEV representation and gains great success. In this work, we propose a new method that unifies both spatial and temporal fusion and merges them into a unified mathematical formulation. The unified fusion could not only provide a new perspective on BEV fusion but also brings new capabilities. With the proposed unified spatial-temporal fusion, our method could support long-range fusion, which is hard to achieve in conventional BEV methods. Moreover, the BEV fusion in our work is temporal-adaptive and the weights of temporal fusion are learnable. In contrast, conventional methods mainly use fixed and equal weights for temporal fusion. Besides, the proposed unified fusion could avoid information lost in conventional BEV fusion methods and make full use of features. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the NuScenes dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method and our method gains the state-of-the-art performance in the map segmentation task.

- **Summary**: Traditional fine-grained image classification typically relies on large-scale training samples with annotated ground-truth. However, some sub-categories have few available samples in real-world applications, and current few-shot models still have difficulty in distinguishing subtle differences among fine-grained categories. To solve this challenge, we propose a novel few-shot fine-grained image classification network (FicNet) using multi-frequency neighborhood (MFN) and double-cross modulation (DCM). MFN focuses on both spatial domain and frequency domain to capture multi-frequency structural representations, which reduces the influence of appearance and background changes to the intra-class distance. DCM consists of bi-crisscross component and double 3D cross-attention component. It modulates the representations by considering global context information and inter-class relationship respectively, which enables the support and query samples respond to the same parts and accurately identify the subtle inter-class differences. The comprehensive experiments on three fine-grained benchmark datasets for two few-shot tasks verify that FicNet has excellent performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Especially, the experiments on two datasets, "Caltech-UCSD Birds" and "Stanford Cars", can obtain classification accuracy 93.17\% and 95.36\%, respectively. They are even higher than that the general fine-grained image classification methods can achieve.

- **Summary**: Research into Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) has attracted great attention, with the goal to segment target objects in a query image given only a few annotated support images of the target class. A key to this challenging task is to fully utilize the information in the support images by exploiting fine-grained correlations between the query and support images. However, most existing approaches either compressed the support information into a few class-wise prototypes, or used partial support information (e.g., only foreground) at the pixel level, causing non-negligible information loss. In this paper, we propose Dense pixel-wise Cross-query-and-support Attention weighted Mask Aggregation (DCAMA), where both foreground and background support information are fully exploited via multi-level pixel-wise correlations between paired query and support features. Implemented with the scaled dot-product attention in the Transformer architecture, DCAMA treats every query pixel as a token, computes its similarities with all support pixels, and predicts its segmentation label as an additive aggregation of all the support pixels' labels -- weighted by the similarities. Based on the unique formulation of DCAMA, we further propose efficient and effective one-pass inference for n-shot segmentation, where pixels of all support images are collected for the mask aggregation at once. Experiments show that our DCAMA significantly advances the state of the art on standard FSS benchmarks of PASCAL-5i, COCO-20i, and FSS-1000, e.g., with 3.1%, 9.7%, and 3.6% absolute improvements in 1-shot mIoU over previous best records. Ablative studies also verify the design DCAMA.

- **Summary**: Collaborative perception has recently shown great potential to improve perception capabilities over single-agent perception. Existing collaborative perception methods usually consider an ideal communication environment. However, in practice, the communication system inevitably suffers from latency issues, causing potential performance degradation and high risks in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving. To mitigate the effect caused by the inevitable latency, from a machine learning perspective, we present the first latency-aware collaborative perception system, which actively adapts asynchronous perceptual features from multiple agents to the same time stamp, promoting the robustness and effectiveness of collaboration. To achieve such a feature-level synchronization, we propose a novel latency compensation module, called SyncNet, which leverages feature-attention symbiotic estimation and time modulation techniques. Experiments results show that the proposed latency aware collaborative perception system with SyncNet can outperforms the state-of-the-art collaborative perception method by 15.6% in the communication latency scenario and keep collaborative perception being superior to single agent perception under severe latency.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers are very popular nowadays due to their state-of-the-art performance in several computer vision tasks, such as image classification and action recognition. Although their performance has been greatly enhanced through highly descriptive patch embeddings and hierarchical structures, there is still limited research on utilizing additional data representations so as to refine the self-attention map of a Transformer. To address this problem, a novel attention mechanism, called multi-manifold multi-head attention, is proposed in this work to substitute the vanilla self-attention of a Transformer. The proposed mechanism models the input space in three distinct manifolds, namely Euclidean, Symmetric Positive Definite and Grassmann, thus leveraging different statistical and geometrical properties of the input for the computation of a highly descriptive attention map. In this way, the proposed attention mechanism can guide a Vision Transformer to become more attentive towards important appearance, color and texture features of an image, leading to improved classification results, as shown by the experimental results on well-known image classification datasets.

- **Summary**: Federated learning is a data decentralization privacy-preserving technique used to perform machine or deep learning in a secure way. In this paper we present theoretical aspects about federated learning, such as the presentation of an aggregation operator, different types of federated learning, and issues to be taken into account in relation to the distribution of data from the clients, together with the exhaustive analysis of a use case where the number of clients varies. Specifically, a use case of medical image analysis is proposed, using chest X-Ray images obtained from an open data repository. In addition to the advantages related to privacy, improvements in predictions (in terms of accuracy, loss and area under the curve) and reduction of execution times will be studied with respect to the classical case (the centralized approach). Different clients will be simulated from the training data, selected in an unbalanced manner. The results of considering three or ten clients are exposed and compared between them and against the centralized case. Two different problems related to intermittent clients are discussed, together with two approaches to be followed for each of them. Specifically, this type of problems may occur because in a real scenario some clients may leave the training, and others enter it, and on the other hand because of client technical or connectivity problems. Finally, improvements and future work in the field are proposed.

- **Summary**: Decoding images from brain activity has been a challenge. Owing to the development of deep learning, there are available tools to solve this problem. The decoded image, which aims to map neural spike trains to low-level visual features and high-level semantic information space. Recently, there are a few studies of decoding from spike trains, however, these studies pay less attention to the foundations of neuroscience and there are few studies that merged receptive field into visual image reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a deep learning neural network architecture with biological properties to reconstruct visual image from spike trains. As far as we know, we implemented a method that integrated receptive field property matrix into loss function at the first time. Our model is an end-to-end decoder from neural spike trains to images. We not only merged Gabor filter into auto-encoder which used to generate images but also proposed a loss function with receptive field properties. We evaluated our decoder on two datasets which contain macaque primary visual cortex neural spikes and salamander retina ganglion cells (RGCs) spikes. Our results show that our method can effectively combine receptive field features to reconstruct images, providing a new approach to visual reconstruction based on neural information.

- **Summary**: The classical $\textit{Procrustes}$ problem is to find a rigid motion (orthogonal transformation and translation) that best aligns two given point-sets in the least-squares sense. The $\textit{Robust Procrustes}$ problem is an important variant, in which a power-1 objective is used instead of least squares to improve robustness to outliers. While the optimal solution of the least-squares problem can be easily computed in closed form, dating back to Sch\"onemann (1966), no such solution is known for the power-1 problem. In this paper we propose a novel convex relaxation for the Robust Procrustes problem. Our relaxation enjoys several theoretical and practical advantages: Theoretically, we prove that our method provides a $\sqrt{2}$-factor approximation to the Robust Procrustes problem, and that, under appropriate assumptions, it exactly recovers the true rigid motion from point correspondences contaminated by outliers. In practice, we find in numerical experiments on both synthetic and real robust Procrustes problems, that our method performs similarly to the standard Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS). However the convexity of our algorithm allows incorporating additional convex penalties, which are not readily amenable to IRLS. This turns out to be a substantial advantage, leading to improved results in high-dimensional problems, including non-rigid shape alignment and semi-supervised interlingual word translation.

- **Summary**: Recent multi-view multimedia applications struggle between high-resolution (HR) visual experience and storage or bandwidth constraints. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multi-View Image Super-Resolution (MVISR) task. It aims to increase the resolution of multi-view images captured from the same scene. One solution is to apply image or video super-resolution (SR) methods to reconstruct HR results from the low-resolution (LR) input view. However, these methods cannot handle large-angle transformations between views and leverage information in all multi-view images. To address these problems, we propose the MVSRnet, which uses geometry information to extract sharp details from all LR multi-view to support the SR of the LR input view. Specifically, the proposed Geometry-Aware Reference Synthesis module in MVSRnet uses geometry information and all multi-view LR images to synthesize pixel-aligned HR reference images. Then, the proposed Dynamic High-Frequency Search network fully exploits the high-frequency textural details in reference images for SR. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our method significantly improves over the state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: We study the new task of class-incremental Novel Class Discovery (class-iNCD), which refers to the problem of discovering novel categories in an unlabelled data set by leveraging a pre-trained model that has been trained on a labelled data set containing disjoint yet related categories. Apart from discovering novel classes, we also aim at preserving the ability of the model to recognize previously seen base categories. Inspired by rehearsal-based incremental learning methods, in this paper we propose a novel approach for class-iNCD which prevents forgetting of past information about the base classes by jointly exploiting base class feature prototypes and feature-level knowledge distillation. We also propose a self-training clustering strategy that simultaneously clusters novel categories and trains a joint classifier for both the base and novel classes. This makes our method able to operate in a class-incremental setting. Our experiments, conducted on three common benchmarks, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Representation learning in recent years has been addressed with self-supervised learning methods. The input data is augmented into two distorted views and an encoder learns the representations that are invariant to distortions -- cross-view prediction. Augmentation is one of the key components in cross-view self-supervised learning frameworks to learn visual representations. This paper presents ExAgt, a novel method to include expert knowledge for augmenting traffic scenarios, to improve the learnt representations without any human annotation. The expert-guided augmentations are generated in an automated fashion based on the infrastructure, the interactions between the EGO and the traffic participants and an ideal sensor model. The ExAgt method is applied in two state-of-the-art cross-view prediction methods and the representations learnt are tested in downstream tasks like classification and clustering. Results show that the ExAgt method improves representation learning compared to using only standard augmentations and it provides a better representation space stability.

- **Summary**: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular disease in which a section of the aorta enlarges, weakening its walls and potentially rupturing the vessel. Abdominal ultrasound has been utilized for diagnostics, but due to its limited image quality and operator dependency, CT scans are usually required for monitoring and treatment planning. Recently, abdominal CT datasets have been successfully utilized to train deep neural networks for automatic aorta segmentation. Knowledge gathered from this solved task could therefore be leveraged to improve US segmentation for AAA diagnosis and monitoring. To this end, we propose CACTUSS: a common anatomical CT-US space, which acts as a virtual bridge between CT and US modalities to enable automatic AAA screening sonography. CACTUSS makes use of publicly available labelled data to learn to segment based on an intermediary representation that inherits properties from both US and CT. We train a segmentation network in this new representation and employ an additional image-to-image translation network which enables our model to perform on real B-mode images. Quantitative comparisons against fully supervised methods demonstrate the capabilities of CACTUSS in terms of Dice Score and diagnostic metrics, showing that our method also meets the clinical requirements for AAA scanning and diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Dense video captioning aims to generate corresponding text descriptions for a series of events in the untrimmed video, which can be divided into two sub-tasks, event detection and event captioning. Unlike previous works that tackle the two sub-tasks separately, recent works have focused on enhancing the inter-task association between the two sub-tasks. However, designing inter-task interactions for event detection and captioning is not trivial due to the large differences in their task specific solutions. Besides, previous event detection methods normally ignore temporal dependencies between events, leading to event redundancy or inconsistency problems. To tackle above the two defects, in this paper, we define event detection as a sequence generation task and propose a unified pre-training and fine-tuning framework to naturally enhance the inter-task association between event detection and captioning. Since the model predicts each event with previous events as context, the inter-dependency between events is fully exploited and thus our model can detect more diverse and consistent events in the video. Experiments on the ActivityNet dataset show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and can be further boosted when pre-trained on extra large-scale video-text data.

- **Summary**: Data-Efficient GANs (DE-GANs), which aim to learn generative models with a limited amount of training data, encounter several challenges for generating high-quality samples. Since data augmentation strategies have largely alleviated the training instability, how to further improve the generative performance of DE-GANs becomes a hotspot. Recently, contrastive learning has shown the great potential of increasing the synthesis quality of DE-GANs, yet related principles are not well explored. In this paper, we revisit and compare different contrastive learning strategies in DE-GANs, and identify (i) the current bottleneck of generative performance is the discontinuity of latent space; (ii) compared to other contrastive learning strategies, Instance-perturbation works towards latent space continuity, which brings the major improvement to DE-GANs. Based on these observations, we propose FakeCLR, which only applies contrastive learning on perturbed fake samples, and devises three related training techniques: Noise-related Latent Augmentation, Diversity-aware Queue, and Forgetting Factor of Queue. Our experimental results manifest the new state of the arts on both few-shot generation and limited-data generation. On multiple datasets, FakeCLR acquires more than 15% FID improvement compared to existing DE-GANs. Code is available at https://github.com/iceli1007/FakeCLR.

- **Summary**: Deep implicit functions have shown remarkable shape modeling ability in various 3D computer vision tasks. One drawback is that it is hard for them to represent a 3D shape as multiple parts. Current solutions learn various primitives and blend the primitives directly in the spatial space, which still struggle to approximate the 3D shape accurately. To resolve this problem, we introduce a novel implicit representation to represent a single 3D shape as a set of parts in the latent space, towards both highly accurate and plausibly interpretable shape modeling. Our insight here is that both the part learning and the part blending can be conducted much easier in the latent space than in the spatial space. We name our method Latent Partition Implicit (LPI), because of its ability of casting the global shape modeling into multiple local part modeling, which partitions the global shape unity. LPI represents a shape as Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) using surface codes. Each surface code is a latent code representing a part whose center is on the surface, which enables us to flexibly employ intrinsic attributes of shapes or additional surface properties. Eventually, LPI can reconstruct both the shape and the parts on the shape, both of which are plausible meshes. LPI is a multi-level representation, which can partition a shape into different numbers of parts after training. LPI can be learned without ground truth signed distances, point normals or any supervision for part partition. LPI outperforms the latest methods under the widely used benchmarks in terms of reconstruction accuracy and modeling interpretability. Our code, data and models are available at https://github.com/chenchao15/LPI.



### Interpolation, extrapolation, and local generalization in common neural networks

- **Summary**: There has been a long history of works showing that neural networks have hard time extrapolating beyond the training set. A recent study by Balestriero et al. (2021) challenges this view: defining interpolation as the state of belonging to the convex hull of the training set, they show that the test set, either in input or neural space, cannot lie for the most part in this convex hull, due to the high dimensionality of the data, invoking the well known curse of dimensionality. Neural networks are then assumed to necessarily work in extrapolative mode. We here study the neural activities of the last hidden layer of typical neural networks. Using an autoencoder to uncover the intrinsic space underlying the neural activities, we show that this space is actually low-dimensional, and that the better the model, the lower the dimensionality of this intrinsic space. In this space, most samples of the test set actually lie in the convex hull of the training set: under the convex hull definition, the models thus happen to work in interpolation regime. Moreover, we show that belonging to the convex hull does not seem to be the relevant criteria. Different measures of proximity to the training set are actually better related to performance accuracy. Thus, typical neural networks do seem to operate in interpolation regime. Good generalization performances are linked to the ability of a neural network to operate well in such a regime.

- **Summary**: We present a semi-supervised learning approach to the temporal action segmentation task. The goal of the task is to temporally detect and segment actions in long, untrimmed procedural videos, where only a small set of videos are densely labelled, and a large collection of videos are unlabelled. To this end, we propose two novel loss functions for the unlabelled data: an action affinity loss and an action continuity loss. The action affinity loss guides the unlabelled samples learning by imposing the action priors induced from the labelled set. Action continuity loss enforces the temporal continuity of actions, which also provides frame-wise classification supervision. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Boundary Smoothing (ABS) approach to build coarser action boundaries for more robust and reliable learning. The proposed loss functions and ABS were evaluated on three benchmarks. Results show that they significantly improved action segmentation performance with a low amount (5% and 10%) of labelled data and achieved comparable results to full supervision with 50% labelled data. Furthermore, ABS succeeded in boosting performance when integrated into fully-supervised learning.

- **Summary**: We present a new framework to reconstruct holistic 3D indoor scenes including both room background and indoor objects from single-view images. Existing methods can only produce 3D shapes of indoor objects with limited geometry quality because of the heavy occlusion of indoor scenes. To solve this, we propose an instance-aligned implicit function (InstPIFu) for detailed object reconstruction. Combining with instance-aligned attention module, our method is empowered to decouple mixed local features toward the occluded instances. Additionally, unlike previous methods that simply represents the room background as a 3D bounding box, depth map or a set of planes, we recover the fine geometry of the background via implicit representation. Extensive experiments on the SUN RGB-D, Pix3D, 3D-FUTURE, and 3D-FRONT datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both background and foreground object reconstruction. Our code and model will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction is an essential task for successful human robot interaction, such as in autonomous driving. In this work, we address the problem of predicting future pedestrian trajectories in a first person view setting with a moving camera. To that end, we propose a novel action-based contrastive learning loss, that utilizes pedestrian action information to improve the learned trajectory embeddings. The fundamental idea behind this new loss is that trajectories of pedestrians performing the same action should be closer to each other in the feature space than the trajectories of pedestrians with significantly different actions. In other words, we argue that behavioral information about pedestrian action influences their future trajectory. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sampling strategy for trajectories that is able to effectively increase negative and positive contrastive samples. Additional synthetic trajectory samples are generated using a trained Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which is at the core of several models developed for trajectory prediction. Results show that our proposed contrastive framework employs contextual information about pedestrian behavior, i.e. action, effectively, and it learns a better trajectory representation. Thus, integrating the proposed contrastive framework within a trajectory prediction model improves its results and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three trajectory prediction benchmarks [31, 32, 26].

- **Summary**: The success of existing video super-resolution (VSR) algorithms stems mainly exploiting the temporal information from the neighboring frames. However, none of these methods have discussed the influence of the temporal redundancy in the patches with stationary objects and background and usually use all the information in the adjacent frames without any discrimination. In this paper, we observe that the temporal redundancy will bring adverse effect to the information propagation,which limits the performance of the most existing VSR methods. Motivated by this observation, we aim to improve existing VSR algorithms by handling the temporal redundancy patches in an optimized manner. We develop two simple yet effective plug and play methods to improve the performance of existing local and non-local propagation-based VSR algorithms on widely-used public videos. For more comprehensive evaluating the robustness and performance of existing VSR algorithms, we also collect a new dataset which contains a variety of public videos as testing set. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed methods can significantly improve the performance of existing VSR methods on the collected videos from wild scenarios while maintain their performance on existing commonly used datasets.

- **Summary**: Objects are usually associated with multiple attributes, and these attributes often exhibit high correlations. Modeling complex relationships between attributes poses a great challenge for multi-attribute learning. This paper proposes a simple yet generic framework named Label2Label to exploit the complex attribute correlations. Label2Label is the first attempt for multi-attribute prediction from the perspective of language modeling. Specifically, it treats each attribute label as a "word" describing the sample. As each sample is annotated with multiple attribute labels, these "words" will naturally form an unordered but meaningful "sentence", which depicts the semantic information of the corresponding sample. Inspired by the remarkable success of pre-training language models in NLP, Label2Label introduces an image-conditioned masked language model, which randomly masks some of the "word" tokens from the label "sentence" and aims to recover them based on the masked "sentence" and the context conveyed by image features. Our intuition is that the instance-wise attribute relations are well grasped if the neural net can infer the missing attributes based on the context and the remaining attribute hints. Label2Label is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. Without incorporating task-specific prior knowledge and highly specialized network designs, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on three different multi-attribute learning tasks, compared to highly customized domain-specific methods.

- **Summary**: Semantic novelty detection aims at discovering unknown categories in the test data. This task is particularly relevant in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving or healthcare, where it is crucial to recognize unknown objects at deployment time and issue a warning to the user accordingly. Despite the impressive advancements of deep learning research, existing models still need a finetuning stage on the known categories in order to recognize the unknown ones. This could be prohibitive when privacy rules limit data access, or in case of strict memory and computational constraints (e.g. edge computing). We claim that a tailored representation learning strategy may be the right solution for effective and efficient semantic novelty detection. Besides extensively testing state-of-the-art approaches for this task, we propose a novel representation learning paradigm based on relational reasoning. It focuses on learning how to measure semantic similarity rather than recognizing known categories. Our experiments show that this knowledge is directly transferable to a wide range of scenarios, and it can be exploited as a plug-and-play module to convert closed-set recognition models into reliable open-set ones.

- **Summary**: Pooling methods are necessities for modern neural networks for increasing receptive fields and lowering down computational costs. However, commonly used hand-crafted pooling approaches, e.g., max pooling and average pooling, may not well preserve discriminative features. While many researchers have elaborately designed various pooling variants in spatial domain to handle these limitations with much progress, the temporal aspect is rarely visited where directly applying hand-crafted methods or these specialized spatial variants may not be optimal. In this paper, we derive temporal lift pooling (TLP) from the Lifting Scheme in signal processing to intelligently downsample features of different temporal hierarchies. The Lifting Scheme factorizes input signals into various sub-bands with different frequency, which can be viewed as different temporal movement patterns. Our TLP is a three-stage procedure, which performs signal decomposition, component weighting and information fusion to generate a refined downsized feature map. We select a typical temporal task with long sequences, i.e. continuous sign language recognition (CSLR), as our testbed to verify the effectiveness of TLP. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show TLP outperforms hand-crafted methods and specialized spatial variants by a large margin (1.5%) with similar computational overhead. As a robust feature extractor, TLP exhibits great generalizability upon multiple backbones on various datasets and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two large-scale CSLR datasets. Visualizations further demonstrate the mechanism of TLP in correcting gloss borders. Code is released.

- **Summary**: One-shot generative domain adaption aims to transfer a pre-trained generator on one domain to a new domain using one reference image only. However, it remains very challenging for the adapted generator (i) to generate diverse images inherited from the pre-trained generator while (ii) faithfully acquiring the domain-specific attributes and styles of the reference image. In this paper, we present a novel one-shot generative domain adaption method, i.e., DiFa, for diverse generation and faithful adaptation. For global-level adaptation, we leverage the difference between the CLIP embedding of reference image and the mean embedding of source images to constrain the target generator. For local-level adaptation, we introduce an attentive style loss which aligns each intermediate token of adapted image with its corresponding token of the reference image. To facilitate diverse generation, selective cross-domain consistency is introduced to select and retain the domain-sharing attributes in the editing latent $\mathcal{W}+$ space to inherit the diversity of pre-trained generator. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially for the cases of large domain gaps. Moreover, our DiFa can easily be extended to zero-shot generative domain adaption with appealing results. Code is available at https://github.com/1170300521/DiFa.

- **Summary**: Data Augmentation (DA) -- generating extra training samples beyond original training set -- has been widely-used in today's unbiased VQA models to mitigate the language biases. Current mainstream DA strategies are synthetic-based methods, which synthesize new samples by either editing some visual regions/words, or re-generating them from scratch. However, these synthetic samples are always unnatural and error-prone. To avoid this issue, a recent DA work composes new augmented samples by randomly pairing pristine images and other human-written questions. Unfortunately, to guarantee augmented samples have reasonable ground-truth answers, they manually design a set of heuristic rules for several question types, which extremely limits its generalization abilities. To this end, we propose a new Knowledge Distillation based Data Augmentation for VQA, dubbed KDDAug. Specifically, we first relax the requirements of reasonable image-question pairs, which can be easily applied to any question types. Then, we design a knowledge distillation (KD) based answer assignment to generate pseudo answers for all composed image-question pairs, which are robust to both in-domain and out-of-distribution settings. Since KDDAug is a model-agnostic DA strategy, it can be seamlessly incorporated into any VQA architectures. Extensive ablation studies on multiple backbones and benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization abilities of KDDAug.

- **Summary**: Recent works on predictive uncertainty estimation have shown promising results on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection for semantic segmentation. However, these methods struggle to precisely locate the point of interest in the image, i.e, the anomaly. This limitation is due to the difficulty of finegrained prediction at the pixel level. To address this issue, we build upon the recent ObsNet approach by providing object instance knowledge to the observer. We extend ObsNet by harnessing an instance-wise mask prediction. We use an additional, class agnostic, object detector to filter and aggregate observer predictions. Finally, we predict an unique anomaly score for each instance in the image. We show that our proposed method accurately disentangles in-distribution objects from OOD objects on three datasets.

- **Summary**: We present a novel dual-flow representation of scene motion that decomposes the optical flow into a static flow field caused by the camera motion and another dynamic flow field caused by the objects' movements in the scene. Based on this representation, we present a dynamic SLAM, dubbed DeFlowSLAM, that exploits both static and dynamic pixels in the images to solve the camera poses, rather than simply using static background pixels as other dynamic SLAM systems do. We propose a dynamic update module to train our DeFlowSLAM in a self-supervised manner, where a dense bundle adjustment layer takes in estimated static flow fields and the weights controlled by the dynamic mask and outputs the residual of the optimized static flow fields, camera poses, and inverse depths. The static and dynamic flow fields are estimated by warping the current image to the neighboring images, and the optical flow can be obtained by summing the two fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeFlowSLAM generalizes well to both static and dynamic scenes as it exhibits comparable performance to the state-of-the-art DROID-SLAM in static and less dynamic scenes while significantly outperforming DROID-SLAM in highly dynamic environments. The code and pre-trained model will be available on the project webpage: \urlstyle{tt} \textcolor{url_color}{\url{https://zju3dv.github.io/deflowslam/}}.

- **Summary**: Transferable adversarial attacks optimize adversaries from a pretrained surrogate model and known label space to fool the unknown black-box models. Therefore, these attacks are restricted by the availability of an effective surrogate model. In this work, we relax this assumption and propose Adversarial Pixel Restoration as a self-supervised alternative to train an effective surrogate model from scratch under the condition of no labels and few data samples. Our training approach is based on a min-max scheme which reduces overfitting via an adversarial objective and thus optimizes for a more generalizable surrogate model. Our proposed attack is complimentary to the adversarial pixel restoration and is independent of any task specific objective as it can be launched in a self-supervised manner. We successfully demonstrate the adversarial transferability of our approach to Vision Transformers as well as Convolutional Neural Networks for the tasks of classification, object detection, and video segmentation. Our training approach improves the transferability of the baseline unsupervised training method by 16.4% on ImageNet val. set.

- **Summary**: Fast adversarial training (FAT) effectively improves the efficiency of standard adversarial training (SAT). However, initial FAT encounters catastrophic overfitting, i.e.,the robust accuracy against adversarial attacks suddenly and dramatically decreases. Though several FAT variants spare no effort to prevent overfitting, they sacrifice much calculation cost. In this paper, we explore the difference between the training processes of SAT and FAT and observe that the attack success rate of adversarial examples (AEs) of FAT gets worse gradually in the late training stage, resulting in overfitting. The AEs are generated by the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) with a zero or random initialization. Based on the observation, we propose a prior-guided FGSM initialization method to avoid overfitting after investigating several initialization strategies, improving the quality of the AEs during the whole training process. The initialization is formed by leveraging historically generated AEs without additional calculation cost. We further provide a theoretical analysis for the proposed initialization method. We also propose a simple yet effective regularizer based on the prior-guided initialization,i.e., the currently generated perturbation should not deviate too much from the prior-guided initialization. The regularizer adopts both historical and current adversarial perturbations to guide the model learning. Evaluations on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can prevent catastrophic overfitting and outperform state-of-the-art FAT methods.

- **Summary**: Due to the high performance and safety requirements of self-driving applications, the complexity of modern autonomous driving systems (ADS) has been growing, instigating the need for more sophisticated hardware which could add to the energy footprint of the ADS platform. Addressing this, edge computing is poised to encompass self-driving applications, enabling the compute-intensive autonomy-related tasks to be offloaded for processing at compute-capable edge servers. Nonetheless, the intricate hardware architecture of ADS platforms, in addition to the stringent robustness demands, set forth complications for task offloading which are unique to autonomous driving. Hence, we present $ROMANUS$, a methodology for robust and efficient task offloading for modular ADS platforms with multi-sensor processing pipelines. Our methodology entails two phases: (i) the introduction of efficient offloading points along the execution path of the involved deep learning models, and (ii) the implementation of a runtime solution based on Deep Reinforcement Learning to adapt the operating mode according to variations in the perceived road scene complexity, network connectivity, and server load. Experiments on the object detection use case demonstrated that our approach is 14.99% more energy-efficient than pure local execution while achieving a 77.06% reduction in risky behavior from a robust-agnostic offloading baseline.

- **Summary**: Cross-device federated learning is an emerging machine learning (ML) paradigm where a large population of devices collectively train an ML model while the data remains on the devices. This research field has a unique set of practical challenges, and to systematically make advances, new datasets curated to be compatible with this paradigm are needed. Existing federated learning benchmarks in the image domain do not accurately capture the scale and heterogeneity of many real-world use cases. We introduce FLAIR, a challenging large-scale annotated image dataset for multi-label classification suitable for federated learning. FLAIR has 429,078 images from 51,414 Flickr users and captures many of the intricacies typically encountered in federated learning, such as heterogeneous user data and a long-tailed label distribution. We implement multiple baselines in different learning setups for different tasks on this dataset. We believe FLAIR can serve as a challenging benchmark for advancing the state-of-the art in federated learning. Dataset access and the code for the benchmark are available at \url{https://github.com/apple/ml-flair}.

- **Summary**: The waive of labels in the target domain makes Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) an attractive technique in many real-world applications, though it also brings great challenges as model adaptation becomes harder without labeled target data. In this paper, we address this issue by seeking compensation from target domain prior knowledge, which is often (partially) available in practice, e.g., from human expertise. This leads to a novel yet practical setting where in addition to the training data, some prior knowledge about the target class distribution are available. We term the setting as Knowledge-guided Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (KUDA). In particular, we consider two specific types of prior knowledge about the class distribution in the target domain: Unary Bound that describes the lower and upper bounds of individual class probabilities, and Binary Relationship that describes the relations between two class probabilities. We propose a general rectification module that uses such prior knowledge to refine model generated pseudo labels. The module is formulated as a Zero-One Programming problem derived from the prior knowledge and a smooth regularizer. It can be easily plugged into self-training based UDA methods, and we combine it with two state-of-the-art methods, SHOT and DINE. Empirical results on four benchmarks confirm that the rectification module clearly improves the quality of pseudo labels, which in turn benefits the self-training stage. With the guidance from prior knowledge, the performances of both methods are substantially boosted. We expect our work to inspire further investigations in integrating prior knowledge in UDA.

- **Summary**: Computer vision-based damage detection using remote cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables efficient and low-cost bridge health monitoring that reduces labor costs and the needs for sensor installation and maintenance. By leveraging recent semantic image segmentation approaches, we are able to find regions of critical structural components and recognize damage at the pixel level using images as the only input. However, existing methods perform poorly when detecting small damages (e.g., cracks and exposed rebars) and thin objects with limited image samples, especially when the components of interest are highly imbalanced. To this end, this paper introduces a semantic segmentation framework that imposes the hierarchical semantic relationship between component category and damage types. For example, certain concrete cracks only present on bridge columns and therefore the non-column region will be masked out when detecting such damages. In this way, the damage detection model could focus on learning features from possible damaged regions only and avoid the effects of other irrelevant regions. We also utilize multi-scale augmentation that provides views with different scales that preserves contextual information of each image without losing the ability of handling small and thin objects. Furthermore, the proposed framework employs important sampling that repeatedly samples images containing rare components (e.g., railway sleeper and exposed rebars) to provide more data samples, which addresses the imbalanced data challenge.

- **Summary**: Neural representations are popular for representing shapes, as they can be learned form sensor data and used for data cleanup, model completion, shape editing, and shape synthesis. Current neural representations can be categorized as either overfitting to a single object instance, or representing a collection of objects. However, neither allows accurate editing of neural scene representations: on the one hand, methods that overfit objects achieve highly accurate reconstructions, but do not generalize to unseen object configurations and thus cannot support editing; on the other hand, methods that represent a family of objects with variations do generalize but produce only approximate reconstructions. We propose NEUFORM to combine the advantages of both overfitted and generalizable representations by adaptively using the one most appropriate for each shape region: the overfitted representation where reliable data is available, and the generalizable representation everywhere else. We achieve this with a carefully designed architecture and an approach that blends the network weights of the two representations, avoiding seams and other artifacts. We demonstrate edits that successfully reconfigure parts of human-designed shapes, such as chairs, tables, and lamps, while preserving semantic integrity and the accuracy of an overfitted shape representation. We compare with two state-of-the-art competitors and demonstrate clear improvements in terms of plausibility and fidelity of the resultant edits.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we are interested in Detection Transformer (DETR), an end-to-end object detection approach based on a transformer encoder-decoder architecture without hand-crafted postprocessing, such as NMS. Inspired by Conditional DETR, an improved DETR with fast training convergence, that presented box queries (originally called spatial queries) for internal decoder layers, we reformulate the object query into the format of the box query that is a composition of the embeddings of the reference point and the transformation of the box with respect to the reference point. This reformulation indicates the connection between the object query in DETR and the anchor box that is widely studied in Faster R-CNN. Furthermore, we learn the box queries from the image content, further improving the detection quality of Conditional DETR still with fast training convergence. In addition, we adopt the idea of axial self-attention to save the memory cost and accelerate the encoder. The resulting detector, called Conditional DETR V2, achieves better results than Conditional DETR, saves the memory cost and runs more efficiently. For example, for the DC$5$-ResNet-$50$ backbone, our approach achieves $44.8$ AP with $16.4$ FPS on the COCO $val$ set and compared to Conditional DETR, it runs $1.6\times$ faster, saves $74$\% of the overall memory cost, and improves $1.0$ AP score.

- **Summary**: Introduction: Hand function is a central determinant of independence after stroke. Measuring hand use in the home environment is necessary to evaluate the impact of new interventions, and calls for novel wearable technologies. Egocentric video can capture hand-object interactions in context, as well as show how more-affected hands are used during bilateral tasks (for stabilization or manipulation). Automated methods are required to extract this information. Objective: To use artificial intelligence-based computer vision to classify hand use and hand role from egocentric videos recorded at home after stroke. Methods: Twenty-one stroke survivors participated in the study. A random forest classifier, a SlowFast neural network, and the Hand Object Detector neural network were applied to identify hand use and hand role at home. Leave-One-Subject-Out-Cross-Validation (LOSOCV) was used to evaluate the performance of the three models. Between-group differences of the models were calculated based on the Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC). Results: For hand use detection, the Hand Object Detector had significantly higher performance than the other models. The macro average MCCs using this model in the LOSOCV were 0.50 +- 0.23 for the more-affected hands and 0.58 +- 0.18 for the less-affected hands. Hand role classification had macro average MCCs in the LOSOCV that were close to zero for all models. Conclusion: Using egocentric video to capture the hand use of stroke survivors at home is feasible. Pose estimation to track finger movements may be beneficial to classifying hand roles in the future.

- **Summary**: Reasoning about 3D objects based on 2D images is challenging due to variations in appearance caused by viewing the object from different orientations. Tasks such as object classification are invariant to 3D rotations and other such as pose estimation are equivariant. However, imposing equivariance as a model constraint is typically not possible with 2D image input because we do not have an a priori model of how the image changes under out-of-plane object rotations. The only $\mathrm{SO}(3)$-equivariant models that currently exist require point cloud or voxel input rather than 2D images. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on icosahedral group convolutions that reasons in $\mathrm{SO(3)}$ by learning a projection of the input image onto an icosahedron. The resulting model is approximately equivariant to rotation in $\mathrm{SO}(3)$. We apply this model to object pose estimation and shape classification tasks and find that it outperforms reasonable baselines. Project website: \url{https://dmklee.github.io/image2icosahedral}

- **Summary**: It was shown that adversarial examples improve object recognition. But what about their opposite side, easy examples? Easy examples are samples that the machine learning model classifies correctly with high confidence. In our paper, we are making the first step toward exploring the potential benefits of using easy examples in the training procedure of neural networks. We propose to use an auxiliary batch normalization for easy examples for the standard and robust accuracy improvement.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We introduce the initial release of our software Robustar, which aims to improve the robustness of vision classification machine learning models through a data-driven perspective. Building upon the recent understanding that the lack of machine learning model's robustness is the tendency of the model's learning of spurious features, we aim to solve this problem from its root at the data perspective by removing the spurious features from the data before training. In particular, we introduce a software that helps the users to better prepare the data for training image classification models by allowing the users to annotate the spurious features at the pixel level of images. To facilitate this process, our software also leverages recent advances to help identify potential images and pixels worthy of attention and to continue the training with newly annotated data. Our software is hosted at the GitHub Repository https://github.com/HaohanWang/Robustar.

- **Summary**: Adversarial examples are transferable between different models. In our paper, we propose to use this property for multi-step domain adaptation. In unsupervised domain adaptation settings, we demonstrate that replacing the source domain with adversarial examples to $\mathcal{H} \Delta \mathcal{H}$-divergence can improve source classifier accuracy on the target domain. Our method can be connected to most domain adaptation techniques. We conducted a range of experiments and achieved improvement in accuracy on Digits and Office-Home datasets.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has seen significant progress in recent years, especially in outdoor environments. However, depth prediction results are not satisfying in indoor scenes where most of the existing data are captured with hand-held devices. As compared to outdoor environments, estimating depth of monocular videos for indoor environments, using self-supervised methods, results in two additional challenges: (i) the depth range of indoor video sequences varies a lot across different frames, making it difficult for the depth network to induce consistent depth cues for training; (ii) the indoor sequences recorded with handheld devices often contain much more rotational motions, which cause difficulties for the pose network to predict accurate relative camera poses. In this work, we propose a novel framework-MonoIndoor++ by giving special considerations to those challenges and consolidating a set of good practices for improving the performance of self-supervised monocular depth estimation for indoor environments. First, a depth factorization module with transformer-based scale regression network is proposed to estimate a global depth scale factor explicitly, and the predicted scale factor can indicate the maximum depth values. Second, rather than using a single-stage pose estimation strategy as in previous methods, we propose to utilize a residual pose estimation module to estimate relative camera poses across consecutive frames iteratively. Third, to incorporate extensive coordinates guidance for our residual pose estimation module, we propose to perform coordinate convolutional encoding directly over the inputs to pose networks. The proposed method is validated on a variety of benchmark indoor datasets, i.e., EuRoC MAV, NYUv2, ScanNet and 7-Scenes, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Building robust and generic object detection frameworks requires scaling to larger label spaces and bigger training datasets. However, it is prohibitively costly to acquire annotations for thousands of categories at a large scale. We propose a novel method that leverages the rich semantics available in recent vision and language models to localize and classify objects in unlabeled images, effectively generating pseudo labels for object detection. Starting with a generic and class-agnostic region proposal mechanism, we use vision and language models to categorize each region of an image into any object category that is required for downstream tasks. We demonstrate the value of the generated pseudo labels in two specific tasks, open-vocabulary detection, where a model needs to generalize to unseen object categories, and semi-supervised object detection, where additional unlabeled images can be used to improve the model. Our empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of the pseudo labels in both tasks, where we outperform competitive baselines and achieve a novel state-of-the-art for open-vocabulary object detection.

- **Summary**: The target of space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) is to increase both the frame rate (also referred to as the temporal resolution) and the spatial resolution of a given video. Recent approaches solve STVSR using end-to-end deep neural networks. A popular solution is to first increase the frame rate of the video; then perform feature refinement among different frame features; and last increase the spatial resolutions of these features. The temporal correlation among features of different frames is carefully exploited in this process. The spatial correlation among features of different (spatial) resolutions, despite being also very important, is however not emphasized. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal feature interaction network to enhance STVSR by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations among features of different frames and spatial resolutions. Specifically, the spatial-temporal frame interpolation module is introduced to interpolate low- and high-resolution intermediate frame features simultaneously and interactively. The spatial-temporal local and global refinement modules are respectively deployed afterwards to exploit the spatial-temporal correlation among different features for their refinement. Finally, a novel motion consistency loss is employed to enhance the motion continuity among reconstructed frames. We conduct experiments on three standard benchmarks, Vid4, Vimeo-90K and Adobe240, and the results demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art methods by a considerable margin. Our codes will be available at https://github.com/yuezijie/STINet-Space-time-Video-Super-resolution.

- **Summary**: Diffusion MRI tractography is an advanced imaging technique that enables in vivo mapping of the brain's white matter connections. White matter parcellation classifies tractography streamlines into clusters or anatomically meaningful tracts. It enables quantification and visualization of whole-brain tractography. Currently, most parcellation methods focus on the deep white matter (DWM), whereas fewer methods address the superficial white matter (SWM) due to its complexity. We propose a novel two-stage deep-learning-based framework, Superficial White Matter Analysis (SupWMA), that performs an efficient and consistent parcellation of 198 SWM clusters from whole-brain tractography. A point-cloud-based network is adapted to our SWM parcellation task, and supervised contrastive learning enables more discriminative representations between plausible streamlines and outliers for SWM. We train our model on a large-scale tractography dataset including streamline samples from labeled long- and medium-range (over 40 mm) SWM clusters and anatomically implausible streamline samples, and we perform testing on six independently acquired datasets of different ages and health conditions (including neonates and patients with space-occupying brain tumors). Compared to several state-of-the-art methods, SupWMA obtains highly consistent and accurate SWM parcellation results on all datasets, showing good generalization across the lifespan in health and disease. In addition, the computational speed of SupWMA is much faster than other methods.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks have revolutionized vision applications. There are image domains and representations, however, that cannot be handled by standard CNNs (e.g., spherical images, superpixels). Such data are usually processed using networks and algorithms specialized for each type. In this work, we show that it may not always be necessary to use specialized neural networks to operate on such spaces. Instead, we introduce a new structured graph convolution operator that can copy 2D convolution weights, transferring the capabilities of already trained traditional CNNs to our new graph network. This network can then operate on any data that can be represented as a positional graph. By converting non-rectilinear data to a graph, we can apply these convolutions on these irregular image domains without requiring training on large domain-specific datasets. Results of transferring pre-trained image networks for segmentation, stylization, and depth prediction are demonstrated for a variety of such data forms.

- **Summary**: Nonlinear iris texture deformations due to pupil size variations are one of the main factors responsible for within-class variance of genuine comparison scores in iris recognition. In dominant approaches to iris recognition, the size of a ring-shaped iris region is linearly scaled to a canonical rectangle, used further in encoding and matching. However, the biological complexity of the iris sphincter and dilator muscles causes the movements of iris features to be nonlinear in a function of pupil size, and not solely organized along radial paths. Alternatively to the existing theoretical models based on the biomechanics of iris musculature, in this paper we propose a novel deep autoencoder-based model that can effectively learn complex movements of iris texture features directly from the data. The proposed model takes two inputs, (a) an ISO-compliant near-infrared iris image with initial pupil size, and (b) the binary mask defining the target shape of the iris. The model makes all the necessary nonlinear deformations to the iris texture to match the shape of the iris in an image (a) with the shape provided by the target mask (b). The identity-preservation component of the loss function helps the model in finding deformations that preserve identity and not only the visual realism of the generated samples. We also demonstrate two immediate applications of this model: better compensation for iris texture deformations in iris recognition algorithms, compared to linear models, and the creation of a generative algorithm that can aid human forensic examiners, who may need to compare iris images with a large difference in pupil dilation. We offer the source codes and model weights available along with this paper.

- **Summary**: Rendering programs have changed the design process completely as they permit to see how the products will look before they are fabricated. However, the rendering process is complicated and takes a significant amount of time, not only in the rendering itself but in the setting of the scene as well. Materials, lights and cameras need to be set in order to get the best quality results. Nevertheless, the optimal output may not be obtained in the first render. This all makes the rendering process a tedious process. Since Goodfellow et al. introduced Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in 2014 [1], they have been used to generate computer-assigned synthetic data, from non-existing human faces to medical data analysis or image style transfer. GANs have been used to transfer image textures from one domain to another. However, paired data from both domains was needed. When Zhu et al. introduced the CycleGAN model, the elimination of this expensive constraint permitted transforming one image from one domain into another, without the need for paired data. This work validates the applicability of CycleGANs on style transfer from an initial sketch to a final render in 2D that represents a 3D design, a step that is paramount in every product design process. We inquiry the possibilities of including CycleGANs as part of the design pipeline, more precisely, applied to the rendering of ring designs. Our contribution entails a crucial part of the process as it allows the customer to see the final product before buying. This work sets a basis for future research, showing the possibilities of GANs in design and establishing a starting point for novel applications to approach crafts design.
