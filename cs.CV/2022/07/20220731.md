- **Summary**: Research on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has focused on improving performance and accuracy for real-world deployments, leading to new models, such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), and optimization techniques, e.g., quantization and pruning for compressed networks. However, the deployment of these innovative models and optimization techniques introduces possible reliability issues, which is a pillar for DNNs to be widely used in safety-critical applications, e.g., autonomous driving. Moreover, scaling technology nodes have the associated risk of multiple faults happening at the same time, a possibility not addressed in state-of-the-art resiliency analyses.   Towards better reliability analysis for DNNs, we present enpheeph, a Fault Injection Framework for Spiking and Compressed DNNs. The enpheeph framework enables optimized execution on specialized hardware devices, e.g., GPUs, while providing complete customizability to investigate different fault models, emulating various reliability constraints and use-cases. Hence, the faults can be executed on SNNs as well as compressed networks with minimal-to-none modifications to the underlying code, a feat that is not achievable by other state-of-the-art tools.   To evaluate our enpheeph framework, we analyze the resiliency of different DNN and SNN models, with different compression techniques. By injecting a random and increasing number of faults, we show that DNNs can show a reduction in accuracy with a fault rate as low as 7 x 10 ^ (-7) faults per parameter, with an accuracy drop higher than 40%. Run-time overhead when executing enpheeph is less than 20% of the baseline execution time when executing 100 000 faults concurrently, at least 10x lower than state-of-the-art frameworks, making enpheeph future-proof for complex fault injection scenarios.   We release enpheeph at https://github.com/Alexei95/enpheeph.

- **Summary**: In our multicultural world, affect-aware AI systems that support humans need the ability to perceive affect across variations in emotion expression patterns across cultures. These systems must perform well in cultural contexts without annotated affect datasets available for training models. A standard assumption in affective computing is that affect recognition models trained and used within the same culture (intracultural) will perform better than models trained on one culture and used on different cultures (intercultural). We test this assumption and present the first systematic study of intercultural affect recognition models using videos of real-world dyadic interactions from six cultures. We develop an attention-based feature selection approach under temporal causal discovery to identify behavioral cues that can be leveraged in intercultural affect recognition models. Across all six cultures, our findings demonstrate that intercultural affect recognition models were as effective or more effective than intracultural models. We identify and contribute useful behavioral features for intercultural affect recognition; facial features from the visual modality were more useful than the audio modality in this study's context. Our paper presents a proof-of-concept and motivation for the future development of intercultural affect recognition systems, especially those deployed in low-resource situations without annotated data.

- **Summary**: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is one of the most important tasks in visual reasoning that requires a model to detect the target object referred by a natural language expression. Among the proposed pipelines, the one-stage Referring Expression Comprehension (OSREC) has become the dominant trend since it merges the region proposal and selection stages. Many state-of-the-art OSREC models adopt a multi-hop reasoning strategy because a sequence of objects is frequently mentioned in a single expression which needs multi-hop reasoning to analyze the semantic relation. However, one unsolved issue of these models is that the number of reasoning steps needs to be pre-defined and fixed before inference, ignoring the varying complexity of expressions. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Multi-step Reasoning Network, which allows the reasoning steps to be dynamically adjusted based on the reasoning state and expression complexity. Specifically, we adopt a Transformer module to memorize & process the reasoning state and a Reinforcement Learning strategy to dynamically infer the reasoning steps. The work achieves the state-of-the-art performance or significant improvements on several REC datasets, ranging from RefCOCO (+, g) with short expressions, to Ref-Reasoning, a dataset with long and complex compositional expressions.

- **Summary**: Graph convolutional network based methods that model the body-joints' relations, have recently shown great promise in 3D skeleton-based human motion prediction. However, these methods have two critical issues: first, deep graph convolutions filter features within only limited graph spectrums, losing sufficient information in the full band; second, using a single graph to model the whole body underestimates the diverse patterns on various body-parts. To address the first issue, we propose adaptive graph scattering, which leverages multiple trainable band-pass graph filters to decompose pose features into richer graph spectrum bands. To address the second issue, body-parts are modeled separately to learn diverse dynamics, which enables finer feature extraction along the spatial dimensions. Integrating the above two designs, we propose a novel skeleton-parted graph scattering network (SPGSN). The cores of the model are cascaded multi-part graph scattering blocks (MPGSBs), building adaptive graph scattering on diverse body-parts, as well as fusing the decomposed features based on the inferred spectrum importance and body-part interactions. Extensive experiments have shown that SPGSN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins of 13.8%, 9.3% and 2.7% in terms of 3D mean per joint position error (MPJPE) on Human3.6M, CMU Mocap and 3DPW datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Neural networks have been rapidly expanding in recent years, with novel strategies and applications. However, challenges such as interpretability, explainability, robustness, safety, trust, and sensibility remain unsolved in neural network technologies, despite the fact that they will unavoidably be addressed for critical applications. Attempts have been made to overcome the challenges in neural network computing by representing and embedding domain knowledge in terms of symbolic representations. Thus, the neuro-symbolic learning (NeSyL) notion emerged, which incorporates aspects of symbolic representation and bringing common sense into neural networks (NeSyL). In domains where interpretability, reasoning, and explainability are crucial, such as video and image captioning, question-answering and reasoning, health informatics, and genomics, NeSyL has shown promising outcomes. This review presents a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art NeSyL approaches, their principles, advances in machine and deep learning algorithms, applications such as opthalmology, and most importantly, future perspectives of this emerging field.

- **Summary**: Temporal consistency is the key challenge of video depth estimation. Previous works are based on additional optical flow or camera poses, which is time-consuming. By contrast, we derive consistency with less information. Since videos inherently exist with heavy temporal redundancy, a missing frame could be recovered from neighboring ones. Inspired by this, we propose the frame masking network (FMNet), a spatial-temporal transformer network predicting the depth of masked frames based on their neighboring frames. By reconstructing masked temporal features, the FMNet can learn intrinsic inter-frame correlations, which leads to consistency. Compared with prior arts, experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable spatial accuracy and higher temporal consistency without any additional information. Our work provides a new perspective on consistent video depth estimation. Our official project page is https://github.com/RaymondWang987/FMNet.

- **Summary**: Existing metrics used to evaluate table structure recognition algorithms have shortcomings with regard to capturing text and empty cells alignment. In this paper, we build on prior work and propose a new metric - TEDS based IOU similarity (TEDS (IOU)) for table structure recognition which uses bounding boxes instead of text while simultaneously being robust against the above disadvantages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metric against previous metrics through various examples.

- **Summary**: Robotic manipulation of deformable objects gains great attention due to its wide applications including medical surgery, home assistance, and automatic food preparation. The ability to deform soft objects remains a great challenge for robots due to difficulties in defining the problem mathematically. In this paper, we address the problem of shaping a piece of dough-like deformable material into a 2D target shape presented upfront. We use a 6 degree-of-freedom WidowX-250 Robot Arm equipped with a rolling pin and information collected from an RGB-D camera and a tactile sensor. We present and compare several control policies, including a dough shrinking action, in extensive experiments across three kinds of deformable materials and across three target dough shape sizes, achieving the intersection over union (IoU) of 0.90. Our results show that: i) rolling dough from the highest dough point is more efficient than from the 2D/3D dough centroid; ii) it might be better to stop the roll movement at the current dough boundary as opposed to the target shape outline; iii) the shrink action might be beneficial only if properly tuned with respect to the expand action; and iv) the Play-Doh material is easier to shape to a target shape as compared to Plasticine or Kinetic sand.

- **Summary**: Introduction: Blood vessels can be non-invasively visualized from a digital fundus image (DFI). Several studies have shown an association between cardiovascular risk and vascular features obtained from DFI. Recent advances in computer vision and image segmentation enable automatising DFI blood vessel segmentation. There is a need for a resource that can automatically compute digital vasculature biomarkers (VBM) from these segmented DFI. Methods: In this paper, we introduce a Python Vasculature BioMarker toolbox, denoted PVBM. A total of 11 VBMs were implemented. In particular, we introduce new algorithmic methods to estimate tortuosity and branching angles. Using PVBM, and as a proof of usability, we analyze geometric vascular differences between glaucomatous patients and healthy controls. Results: We built a fully automated vasculature biomarker toolbox based on DFI segmentations and provided a proof of usability to characterize the vascular changes in glaucoma. For arterioles and venules, all biomarkers were significant and lower in glaucoma patients compared to healthy controls except for tortuosity, venular singularity length and venular branching angles.   Conclusion: We have automated the computation of 11 VBMs from retinal blood vessel segmentation. The PVBM toolbox is made open source under a GNU GPL 3 license and is available on physiozoo.com (following publication).

- **Summary**: Forecasting the future states of surrounding traffic participants is a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The recently proposed occupancy flow field prediction introduces a scalable and effective representation to jointly predict surrounding agents' future motions in a scene. However, the challenging part is to model the underlying social interactions among traffic agents and the relations between occupancy and flow. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Multi-modal Hierarchical Transformer network that fuses the vectorized (agent motion) and visual (scene flow, map, and occupancy) modalities and jointly predicts the flow and occupancy of the scene. Specifically, visual and vector features from sensory data are encoded through a multi-stage Transformer module and then a late-fusion Transformer module with temporal pixel-wise attention. Importantly, a flow-guided multi-head self-attention (FG-MSA) module is designed to better aggregate the information on occupancy and flow and model the mathematical relations between them. The proposed method is comprehensively validated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and compared against several state-of-the-art models. The results reveal that our model with much more compact architecture and data inputs than other methods can achieve comparable performance. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating vectorized agent motion features and the proposed FG-MSA module. Compared to the ablated model without the FG-MSA module, which won 2nd place in the 2022 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge, the current model shows better separability for flow and occupancy and further performance improvements.

- **Summary**: Human infants learn the names of objects and develop their own conceptual systems without explicit supervision. In this study, we propose methods for learning aligned vision-language conceptual systems inspired by infants' word learning mechanisms. The proposed model learns the associations of visual objects and words online and gradually constructs cross-modal relational graph networks. Additionally, we also propose an aligned cross-modal representation learning method that learns semantic representations of visual objects and words in a self-supervised manner based on the cross-modal relational graph networks. It allows entities of different modalities with conceptually the same meaning to have similar semantic representation vectors. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our method, including object-to-word mapping and zero-shot learning tasks, showing that the proposed model significantly outperforms the baselines and that each conceptual system is topologically aligned.

- **Summary**: Supervised deep learning methods for semantic medical image segmentation are getting increasingly popular in the past few years.However, in resource constrained settings, getting large number of annotated images is very difficult as it mostly requires experts, is expensive and time-consuming.Semi-supervised segmentation can be an attractive solution where a very few labeled images are used along with a large number of unlabeled ones. While the gap between supervised and semi-supervised methods have been dramatically reduced for classification problems in the past couple of years, there still remains a larger gap in segmentation methods. In this work, we adapt a state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification method FixMatch to semantic segmentation task, introducing FixMatchSeg. FixMatchSeg is evaluated in four different publicly available datasets of different anatomy and different modality: cardiac ultrasound, chest X-ray, retinal fundus image, and skin images. When there are few labels, we show that FixMatchSeg performs on par with strong supervised baselines.

- **Summary**: In ultrasound imaging the appearance of homogeneous regions of tissue is subject to speckle, which for certain applications can make the detection of tissue irregularities difficult. To cope with this, it is common practice to apply speckle reduction filters to the images. Most conventional filtering techniques are fairly hand-crafted and often need to be finely tuned to the present hardware, imaging scheme and application. Learning based techniques on the other hand suffer from the need for a target image for training (in case of fully supervised techniques) or require narrow, complex physics-based models of the speckle appearance that might not apply in all cases. With this work we propose a deep-learning based method for speckle removal without these limitations. To enable this, we make use of realistic ultrasound simulation techniques that allow for instantiation of several independent speckle realizations that represent the exact same tissue, thus allowing for the application of image reconstruction techniques that work with pairs of differently corrupted data. Compared to two other state-of-the-art approaches (non-local means and the Optimized Bayesian non-local means filter) our method performs favorably in qualitative comparisons and quantitative evaluation, despite being trained on simulations alone, and is several orders of magnitude faster.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce DA$^2$, the first large-scale dual-arm dexterity-aware dataset for the generation of optimal bimanual grasping pairs for arbitrary large objects. The dataset contains about 9M pairs of parallel-jaw grasps, generated from more than 6000 objects and each labeled with various grasp dexterity measures. In addition, we propose an end-to-end dual-arm grasp evaluation model trained on the rendered scenes from this dataset. We utilize the evaluation model as our baseline to show the value of this novel and nontrivial dataset by both online analysis and real robot experiments.

  (2021) 5148-5157
- **Summary**: Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in real-world image super-resolution (SR). However, adversarial image samples with quasi-imperceptible noises could threaten deep learning SR models. In this paper, we propose a robust deep learning framework for real-world SR that randomly erases potential adversarial noises in the frequency domain of input images or features. The rationale is that on the SR task clean images or features have a different pattern from the attacked ones in the frequency domain. Observing that existing adversarial attacks usually add high-frequency noises to input images, we introduce a novel random frequency mask module that blocks out high-frequency components possibly containing the harmful perturbations in a stochastic manner. Since the frequency masking may not only destroys the adversarial perturbations but also affects the sharp details in a clean image, we further develop an adversarial sample classifier based on the frequency domain of images to determine if applying the proposed mask module. Based on the above ideas, we devise a novel real-world image SR framework that combines the proposed frequency mask modules and the proposed adversarial classifier with an existing super-resolution backbone network. Experiments show that our proposed method is more insensitive to adversarial attacks and presents more stable SR results than existing models and defenses.

- **Summary**: Artistic text recognition is an extremely challenging task with a wide range of applications. However, current scene text recognition methods mainly focus on irregular text while have not explored artistic text specifically. The challenges of artistic text recognition include the various appearance with special-designed fonts and effects, the complex connections and overlaps between characters, and the severe interference from background patterns. To alleviate these problems, we propose to recognize the artistic text at three levels. Firstly, corner points are applied to guide the extraction of local features inside characters, considering the robustness of corner structures to appearance and shape. In this way, the discreteness of the corner points cuts off the connection between characters, and the sparsity of them improves the robustness for background interference. Secondly, we design a character contrastive loss to model the character-level feature, improving the feature representation for character classification. Thirdly, we utilize Transformer to learn the global feature on image-level and model the global relationship of the corner points, with the assistance of a corner-query cross-attention mechanism. Besides, we provide an artistic text dataset to benchmark the performance. Experimental results verify the significant superiority of our proposed method on artistic text recognition and also achieve state-of-the-art performance on several blurred and perspective datasets.

- **Summary**: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been trained to be professional artists able to create stunning artworks such as face generation and image style transfer. In this paper, we focus on a realistic business scenario: automated generation of customizable icons given desired mobile applications and theme styles. We first introduce a theme-application icon dataset, termed AppIcon, where each icon has two orthogonal theme and app labels. By investigating a strong baseline StyleGAN2, we observe mode collapse caused by the entanglement of the orthogonal labels. To solve this challenge, we propose IconGAN composed of a conditional generator and dual discriminators with orthogonal augmentations, and a contrastive feature disentanglement strategy is further designed to regularize the feature space of the two discriminators. Compared with other approaches, IconGAN indicates a superior advantage on the AppIcon benchmark. Further analysis also justifies the effectiveness of disentangling app and theme representations.

- **Summary**: Applications on Medical Image Analysis suffer from acute shortage of large volume of data properly annotated by medical experts. Supervised Learning algorithms require a large volumes of balanced data to learn robust representations. Often supervised learning algorithms require various techniques to deal with imbalanced data. Self-supervised learning algorithms on the other hand are robust to imbalance in the data and are capable of learning robust representations. In this work, we train a 3D BYOL self-supervised model using gradient accumulation technique to deal with the large number of samples in a batch generally required in a self-supervised algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first of its kind in this domain. We compare the results obtained through our experiments in the downstream task of ACL Tear Injury detection with the contemporary self-supervised pre-training methods and also with ResNet3D-18 initialized with the Kinetics-400 pre-trained weights. From the downstream task experiments, it is evident that the proposed framework outperforms the existing baselines.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel out-of-distribution (OOD) detection framework named MoodCat for image classifiers. MoodCat masks a random portion of the input image and uses a generative model to synthesize the masked image to a new image conditioned on the classification result. It then calculates the semantic difference between the original image and the synthesized one for OOD detection. Compared to existing solutions, MoodCat naturally learns the semantic information of the in-distribution data with the proposed mask and conditional synthesis strategy, which is critical to identifying OODs. Experimental results demonstrate that MoodCat outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection solutions by a large margin.

- **Summary**: With the development of generative-based self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches like BeiT and MAE, how to learn good representations by masking random patches of the input image and reconstructing the missing information has grown in concern. However, BeiT and PeCo need a "pre-pretraining" stage to produce discrete codebooks for masked patches representing. MAE does not require a pre-training codebook process, but setting pixels as reconstruction targets may introduce an optimization gap between pre-training and downstream tasks that good reconstruction quality may not always lead to the high descriptive capability for the model. Considering the above issues, in this paper, we propose a simple Self-distillated masked AutoEncoder network, namely SdAE. SdAE consists of a student branch using an encoder-decoder structure to reconstruct the missing information, and a teacher branch producing latent representation of masked tokens. We also analyze how to build good views for the teacher branch to produce latent representation from the perspective of information bottleneck. After that, we propose a multi-fold masking strategy to provide multiple masked views with balanced information for boosting the performance, which can also reduce the computational complexity. Our approach generalizes well: with only 300 epochs pre-training, a vanilla ViT-Base model achieves an 84.1% fine-tuning accuracy on ImageNet-1k classification, 48.6 mIOU on ADE20K segmentation, and 48.9 mAP on COCO detection, which surpasses other methods by a considerable margin.

- **Summary**: As an important upstream task for many medical applications, supervised landmark localization still requires non-negligible annotation costs to achieve desirable performance. Besides, due to cumbersome collection procedures, the limited size of medical landmark datasets impacts the effectiveness of large-scale self-supervised pre-training methods. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework for one-shot medical landmark localization, which first infers landmarks by unsupervised registration from the labeled exemplar to unlabeled targets, and then utilizes these noisy pseudo labels to train robust detectors. To handle the significant structure variations, we learn an end-to-end cascade of global alignment and local deformations, under the guidance of novel loss functions which incorporate edge information. In stage II, we explore self-consistency for selecting reliable pseudo labels and cross-consistency for semi-supervised learning. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on public datasets of different body parts, which demonstrates its general applicability.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown exceptional performance for a range of medical imaging tasks. However, conventional CNNs are not able to explain their reasoning process, therefore limiting their adoption in clinical practice. In this work, we propose an inherently interpretable CNN for regression using similarity-based comparisons (INSightR-Net) and demonstrate our methods on the task of diabetic retinopathy grading. A prototype layer incorporated into the architecture enables visualization of the areas in the image that are most similar to learned prototypes. The final prediction is then intuitively modeled as a mean of prototype labels, weighted by the similarities. We achieved competitive prediction performance with our INSightR-Net compared to a ResNet baseline, showing that it is not necessary to compromise performance for interpretability. Furthermore, we quantified the quality of our explanations using sparsity and diversity, two concepts considered important for a good explanation, and demonstrated the effect of several parameters on the latent space embeddings.

- **Summary**: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a new paradigm for learning discriminative representations without labelled data and has reached comparable or even state-of-the-art results in comparison to supervised counterparts. Contrastive Learning (CL) is one of the most well-known approaches in SSL that attempts to learn general, informative representations of data. CL methods have been mostly developed for applications in computer vision and natural language processing where only a single sensor modality is used. A majority of pervasive computing applications, however, exploit data from a range of different sensor modalities. While existing CL methods are limited to learning from one or two data sources, we propose COCOA (Cross mOdality COntrastive leArning), a self-supervised model that employs a novel objective function to learn quality representations from multisensor data by computing the cross-correlation between different data modalities and minimizing the similarity between irrelevant instances. We evaluate the effectiveness of COCOA against eight recently introduced state-of-the-art self-supervised models, and two supervised baselines across five public datasets. We show that COCOA achieves superior classification performance to all other approaches. Also, COCOA is far more label-efficient than the other baselines including the fully supervised model using only one-tenth of available labelled data.

- **Summary**: Generalizability of deep learning models may be severely affected by the difference in the distributions of the train (source domain) and the test (target domain) sets, e.g., when the sets are produced by different hardware. As a consequence of this domain shift, a certain model might perform well on data from one clinic, and then fail when deployed in another. We propose a very light and transparent approach to perform test-time domain adaptation. The idea is to substitute the target low-frequency Fourier space components that are deemed to reflect the style of an image. To maximize the performance, we implement the "optimal style donor" selection technique, and use a number of source data points for altering a single target scan appearance (Multi-Source Transferring). We study the effect of severity of domain shift on the performance of the method, and show that our training-free approach reaches the state-of-the-art level of complicated deep domain adaptation models. The code for our experiments is released.

- **Summary**: Language modality within the vision language pretraining framework is innately discretized, endowing each word in the language vocabulary a semantic meaning. In contrast, visual modality is inherently continuous and high-dimensional, which potentially prohibits the alignment as well as fusion between vision and language modalities. We therefore propose to "discretize" the visual representation by joint learning a codebook that imbues each visual token a semantic. We then utilize these discretized visual semantics as self-supervised ground-truths for building our Masked Image Modeling objective, a counterpart of Masked Language Modeling which proves successful for language models. To optimize the codebook, we extend the formulation of VQ-VAE which gives a theoretic guarantee. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach across common vision-language benchmarks.

- **Summary**: A gaze-fixating robot perceives distance to the fixated object and relative positions of surrounding objects immediately, accurately, and robustly. We show how fixation, which is the act of looking at one object while moving, exploits regularities in the geometry of 3D space to obtain this information. These regularities introduce rotation-translation couplings that are not commonly used in structure from motion. To validate, we use a Franka Emika Robot with an RGB camera. We a) find that error in distance estimate is less than 5 mm at a distance of 15 cm, and b) show how relative position can be used to find obstacles under challenging scenarios. We combine accurate distance estimates and obstacle information into a reactive robot behavior that is able to pick up objects of unknown size, while impeded by unforeseen obstacles.

- **Summary**: Digital data collected over the decades and data currently being produced with use of information technology is vastly the unlabeled data or data without description. The unlabeled data is relatively easy to acquire but expensive to label even with use of domain experts. Most of the recent works focus on use of active learning with uncertainty metrics measure to address this problem. Although most uncertainty selection strategies are very effective, they fail to take informativeness of the unlabeled instances into account and are prone to querying outliers. In order to address these challenges we propose an hybrid approach of computing both the uncertainty and informativeness of an instance, then automaticaly label the computed instances using budget annotator. To reduce the annotation cost, we employ the state-of-the-art pre-trained models in order to avoid querying information already contained in those models. Our extensive experiments on different sets of datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: The boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis L.) is a serious pest that primarily feeds on cotton plants. In places like Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, due to sub-tropical climatic conditions, cotton plants can grow year-round and therefore the left-over seeds from the previous season during harvest can continue to grow in the middle of rotation crops like corn (Zea mays L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). These feral or volunteer cotton (VC) plants when reach the pinhead squaring phase (5-6 leaf stage) can act as hosts for the boll weevil pest. The Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Program (TBWEP) employs people to locate and eliminate VC plants growing by the side of roads or fields with rotation crops but the ones growing in the middle of fields remain undetected. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of computer vision (CV) algorithm based on You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) for detecting VC plants growing in the middle of corn fields at three different growth stages (V3, V6, and VT) using unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) remote sensing imagery. All the four variants of YOLOv5 (s, m, l, and x) were used and their performances were compared based on classification accuracy, mean average precision (mAP), and F1-score. It was found that YOLOv5s could detect VC plants with a maximum classification accuracy of 98% and mAP of 96.3 % at the V6 stage of corn while YOLOv5s and YOLOv5m resulted in the lowest classification accuracy of 85% and YOLOv5m and YOLOv5l had the least mAP of 86.5% at the VT stage on images of size 416 x 416 pixels. The developed CV algorithm has the potential to effectively detect and locate VC plants growing in the middle of corn fields as well as expedite the management aspects of TBWEP.

- **Summary**: Processing 3D data efficiently has always been a challenge. Spatial operations on large-scale point clouds, stored as sparse data, require extra cost. Attracted by the success of transformers, researchers are using multi-head attention for vision tasks. However, attention calculations in transformers come with quadratic complexity in the number of inputs and miss spatial intuition on sets like point clouds. We redesign set transformers in this work and incorporate them into a hierarchical framework for shape classification and part and scene segmentation. We propose our local attention unit, which captures features in a spatial neighborhood. We also compute efficient and dynamic global cross attentions by leveraging sampling and grouping at each iteration. Finally, to mitigate the non-heterogeneity of point clouds, we propose an efficient Multi-Scale Tokenization (MST), which extracts scale-invariant tokens for attention operations. The proposed hierarchical model achieves state-of-the-art shape classification in mean accuracy and yields results on par with the previous segmentation methods while requiring significantly fewer computations. Our proposed architecture predicts segmentation labels with around half the latency and parameter count of the previous most efficient method with comparable performance.

- **Summary**: Short answer: Yes, Long answer: No! Indeed, research on adversarial robustness has led to invaluable insights helping us understand and explore different aspects of the problem. Many attacks and defenses have been proposed over the last couple of years. The problem, however, remains largely unsolved and poorly understood. Here, I argue that the current formulation of the problem serves short term goals, and needs to be revised for us to achieve bigger gains. Specifically, the bound on perturbation has created a somewhat contrived setting and needs to be relaxed. This has misled us to focus on model classes that are not expressive enough to begin with. Instead, inspired by human vision and the fact that we rely more on robust features such as shape, vertices, and foreground objects than non-robust features such as texture, efforts should be steered towards looking for significantly different classes of models. Maybe instead of narrowing down on imperceptible adversarial perturbations, we should attack a more general problem which is finding architectures that are simultaneously robust to perceptible perturbations, geometric transformations (e.g. rotation, scaling), image distortions (lighting, blur), and more (e.g. occlusion, shadow). Only then we may be able to solve the problem of adversarial vulnerability.

- **Summary**: Training deep neural networks for image recognition often requires large-scale human annotated data. To reduce the reliance of deep neural solutions on labeled data, state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods have been proposed in the literature. Nonetheless, the use of such semi-supervised methods has been quite rare in the field of facial expression recognition (FER). In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on recently proposed state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods in the context of FER. We conduct comparative study on eight semi-supervised learning methods, namely Pi-Model, Pseudo-label, Mean-Teacher, VAT, MixMatch, ReMixMatch, UDA, and FixMatch, on three FER datasets (FER13, RAF-DB, and AffectNet), when various amounts of labeled samples are used. We also compare the performance of these methods against fully-supervised training. Our study shows that when training existing semi-supervised methods on as little as 250 labeled samples per class can yield comparable performances to that of fully-supervised methods trained on the full labeled datasets. To facilitate further research in this area, we make our code publicly available at: https://github.com/ShuvenduRoy/SSL_FER
