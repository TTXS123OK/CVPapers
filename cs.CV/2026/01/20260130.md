- **Summary**: Can a diffusion model trained on bedrooms recover human faces? Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal. These results provide a principled justification on when weak diffusion priors can be used reliably.

- **Summary**: High-resolution (5MP+) stereo vision systems are essential for advancing robotic capabilities, enabling operation over longer ranges and generating significantly denser and accurate 3D point clouds. However, realizing the full potential of high-angular-resolution sensors requires a commensurately higher level of calibration accuracy and faster processing -- requirements often unmet by conventional methods. This study addresses that critical gap by processing 5MP camera imagery using a novel, advanced frame-to-frame calibration and stereo matching methodology designed to achieve both high accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach to evaluate real-time performance by comparing real-time disparity maps with ground-truth disparity maps derived from more computationally intensive stereo matching algorithms. Crucially, the research demonstrates that high-pixel-count cameras yield high-quality point clouds only through the implementation of high-accuracy calibration.

- **Summary**: Despite progress in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), object hallucination remains a critical issue in image captioning task, where models generate descriptions of non-existent objects, compromising their reliability. Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap. It first validates objects' existence in sampled candidate captions and further mitigates object hallucination via caption selection or aggregation. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework mitigates object hallucination significantly in image captioning task (e.g., 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B), surpassing the previous SOTA methods. This result highlights a novel path towards mitigating hallucination by unlocking the inherent potential within LVLMs themselves.

- **Summary**: Interactive 3D model texture editing presents enhanced opportunities for creating 3D assets, with freehand drawing style offering the most intuitive experience. However, existing methods primarily support sketch-based interactions for outlining, while the utilization of coarse-grained scribble-based interaction remains limited. Furthermore, current methodologies often encounter challenges due to the abstract nature of scribble instructions, which can result in ambiguous editing intentions and unclear target semantic locations. To address these issues, we propose ScribbleSense, an editing method that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models to effectively resolve these challenges. We leverage the visual capabilities of MLLMs to predict the editing intent behind the scribbles. Once the semantic intent of the scribble is discerned, we employ globally generated images to extract local texture details, thereby anchoring local semantics and alleviating ambiguities concerning the target semantic locations. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively leverages the strengths of MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art interactive editing performance for scribble-based texture editing.



### CARE: Multi-Task Pretraining for Latent Continuous Action Representation in Robot Control

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise for robot control, but their dependence on action supervision limits scalability and generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce CARE, a novel framework designed to train VLA models for robotic task execution. Unlike existing methods that depend on action annotations during pretraining, CARE eliminates the need for explicit action labels by leveraging only video-text pairs. These weakly aligned data sources enable the model to learn continuous latent action representations through a newly designed multi-task pretraining objective. During fine-tuning, a small set of labeled data is used to train the action head for control. Experimental results across various simulation tasks demonstrate CARE's superior success rate, semantic interpretability, and ability to avoid shortcut learning. These results underscore CARE's scalability, interpretability, and effectiveness in robotic control with weak supervision.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in generative modeling has enabled high-quality visual synthesis with diffusion-based frameworks, supporting controllable sampling and large-scale training. Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models. The approach further yields complementary gains when combined with classifier-free guidance, demonstrating enhanced semantic coherence and visual fidelity. These results establish representation-informed diffusion sampling as a practical strategy for reinforcing semantic preservation and image consistency.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose an intra-class subdivision pixel contrastive learning (SPCL) framework for cardiac image segmentation to address representation contamination at boundaries. The novel concept ``Unconcerned sample'' is proposed to distinguish pixel representations at the inner and boundary regions within the same class, facilitating a clearer characterization of intra-class variations. A novel boundary contrastive loss for boundary representations is proposed to enhance representation discrimination across boundaries. The advantages of the unconcerned sample and boundary contrastive loss are analyzed theoretically. Experimental results in public cardiac datasets demonstrate that SPCL significantly improves segmentation performance, outperforming existing methods with respect to segmentation quality and boundary precision. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jrstud203/SPCL.

- **Summary**: Although unlearning-based defenses claim to purge Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) concepts from diffusion models (DMs), we reveals that this "forgetting" is largely an illusion. Unlearning partially disrupts the mapping between linguistic symbols and the underlying knowledge, which remains intact as dormant memories. We find that the distributional discrepancy in the denoising process serves as a measurable indicator of how much of the mapping is retained, also reflecting the strength of unlearning. Inspired by this, we propose IVO (Initial Latent Variable Optimization), a concise and powerful attack framework that reactivates these dormant memories by reconstructing the broken mappings. Through Image Inversion}, Adversarial Optimization and Reused Attack, IVO optimizes initial latent variables to realign the noise distribution of unlearned models with their original unsafe states. Extensive experiments across 8 widely used unlearning techniques demonstrate that IVO achieves superior attack success rates and strong semantic consistency, exposing fundamental flaws in current defenses. The code is available at anonymous.4open.science/r/IVO/. Warning: This paper has unsafe images that may offend some readers.



### Head-Aware Visual Cropping: Enhancing Fine-Grained VQA with Attention-Guided Subimage

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) but remain limited in fine-grained reasoning due to low-resolution inputs and noisy attention aggregation. We propose \textbf{Head Aware Visual Cropping (HAVC)}, a training-free method that improves visual grounding by leveraging a selectively refined subset of attention heads. HAVC first filters heads through an OCR-based diagnostic task, ensuring that only those with genuine grounding ability are retained. At inference, these heads are further refined using spatial entropy for stronger spatial concentration and gradient sensitivity for predictive contribution. The fused signals produce a reliable Visual Cropping Guidance Map, which highlights the most task-relevant region and guides the cropping of a subimage subsequently provided to the MLLM together with the image-question pair. Extensive experiments on multiple fine-grained VQA benchmarks demonstrate that HAVC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art cropping strategies, achieving more precise localization, stronger visual grounding, providing a simple yet effective strategy for enhancing precision in MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Visual anomaly detection in multi-class settings poses significant challenges due to the diversity of object categories, the scarcity of anomalous examples, and the presence of camouflaged defects. In this paper, we propose PromptMAD, a cross-modal prompting framework for unsupervised visual anomaly detection and localization that integrates semantic guidance through vision-language alignment. By leveraging CLIP-encoded text prompts describing both normal and anomalous class-specific characteristics, our method enriches visual reconstruction with semantic context, improving the detection of subtle and textural anomalies. To further address the challenge of class imbalance at the pixel level, we incorporate Focal loss function, which emphasizes hard-to-detect anomalous regions during training. Our architecture also includes a supervised segmentor that fuses multi-scale convolutional features with Transformer-based spatial attention and diffusion iterative refinement, yielding precise and high-resolution anomaly maps. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art pixel-level performance, improving mean AUC to 98.35% and AP to 66.54%, while maintaining efficiency across diverse categories.

- **Summary**: Diffusion posterior sampling solves inverse problems by combining a pretrained diffusion prior with measurement-consistency guidance, but it often fails to recover fine details because measurement terms are applied in a manner that is weakly coupled to the diffusion noise level. At high noise, data-consistency gradients computed from inaccurate estimates can be geometrically incongruent with the posterior geometry, inducing early-step drift, spurious high-frequency artifacts, plus sensitivity to schedules and ill-conditioned operators. To address these concerns, we propose a noise--frequency Continuation framework that constructs a continuous family of intermediate posteriors whose likelihood enforces measurement consistency only within a noise-dependent frequency band. This principle is instantiated with a stabilized posterior sampler that combines a diffusion predictor, band-limited likelihood guidance, and a multi-resolution consistency strategy that aggressively commits reliable coarse corrections while conservatively adopting high-frequency details only when they become identifiable. Across super-resolution, inpainting, and deblurring, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves motion deblurring PSNR by up to 5 dB over strong baselines.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing personalized talking faces that uphold and highlight a speaker's unique style while maintaining lip-sync accuracy remains a significant challenge. A primary limitation of existing approaches is the intrinsic confounding of speaker-specific talking style and semantic content within facial motions, which prevents the faithful transfer of a speaker's unique persona to arbitrary speech. In this paper, we propose MirrorTalk, a generative framework based on a conditional diffusion model, combined with a Semantically-Disentangled Style Encoder (SDSE) that can distill pure style representations from a brief reference video. To effectively utilize this representation, we further introduce a hierarchical modulation strategy within the diffusion process. This mechanism guides the synthesis by dynamically balancing the contributions of audio and style features across distinct facial regions, ensuring both precise lip-sync accuracy and expressive full-face dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MirrorTalk achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of lip-sync accuracy and personalization preservation.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in subject-driven image generation using diffusion models have attracted considerable attention for their remarkable capabilities in producing high-quality images. Nevertheless, the potential of Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models, despite their unified architecture and efficient inference, remains underexplored. In this work, we present DreamVAR, a novel framework for subject-driven image synthesis built upon a VAR model that employs next-scale prediction. Technically, multi-scale features of the reference subject are first extracted by a visual tokenizer. Instead of interleaving these conditional features with target image tokens across scales, our DreamVAR pre-fills the full subject feature sequence prior to predicting target image tokens. This design simplifies autoregressive dependencies and mitigates the train-test discrepancy in multi-scale conditioning scenario within the VAR paradigm. DreamVAR further incorporates reinforcement learning to jointly enhance semantic alignment and subject consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamVAR achieves superior appearance preservation compared to leading diffusion-based methods.

- **Summary**: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) aims to retrieve a target video from a large gallery using a reference video and a textual query specifying visual modifications. However, existing benchmarks consider only visual changes, ignoring videos that differ in audio despite visual similarity. To address this limitation, we introduce Composed retrieval for Video with its Audio CoVA, a new retrieval task that accounts for both visual and auditory variations. To support this, we construct AV-Comp, a benchmark consisting of video pairs with cross-modal changes and corresponding textual queries that describe the differences. We also propose AVT Compositional Fusion (AVT), which integrates video, audio, and text features by selectively aligning the query to the most relevant modality. AVT outperforms traditional unimodal fusion and serves as a strong baseline for CoVA. Examples from the proposed dataset, including both visual and auditory information, are available at https://perceptualai-lab.github.io/CoVA/.

- **Summary**: As generative AI achieves hyper-realism, superficial artifact detection has become obsolete. While prevailing methods rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning of black-box backbones, we propose that forgery detection capability is already encoded within pre-trained models rather than requiring end-to-end retraining. To elicit this intrinsic capability, we propose the discriminative neural anchors (DNA) framework, which employs a coarse-to-fine excavation mechanism. First, by analyzing feature decoupling and attention distribution shifts, we pinpoint critical intermediate layers where the focus of the model logically transitions from global semantics to local anomalies. Subsequently, we introduce a triadic fusion scoring metric paired with a curvature-truncation strategy to strip away semantic redundancy, precisely isolating the forgery-discriminative units (FDUs) inherently imprinted with sensitivity to forgery traces. Moreover, we introduce HIFI-Gen, a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark built upon the very latest models, to address the lag in existing datasets. Experiments demonstrate that by solely relying on these anchors, DNA achieves superior detection performance even under few-shot conditions. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable robustness across diverse architectures and against unseen generative models, validating that waking up latent neurons is more effective than extensive fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: Body condition score (BCS) is a widely used indicator of body energy status and is closely associated with metabolic status, reproductive performance, and health in dairy cattle; however, conventional visual scoring is subjective and labor-intensive. Computer vision approaches have been applied to BCS prediction, with depth images widely used because they capture geometric information independent of coat color and texture. More recently, three-dimensional point cloud data have attracted increasing interest due to their ability to represent richer geometric characteristics of animal morphology, but direct head-to-head comparisons with depth image-based approaches remain limited. In this study, we compared top-view depth image and point cloud data for BCS prediction under four settings: 1) unsegmented raw data, 2) segmented full-body data, 3) segmented hindquarter data, and 4) handcrafted feature data. Prediction models were evaluated using data from 1,020 dairy cows collected on a commercial farm, with cow-level cross-validation to prevent data leakage. Depth image-based models consistently achieved higher accuracy than point cloud-based models when unsegmented raw data and segmented full-body data were used, whereas comparable performance was observed when segmented hindquarter data were used. Both depth image and point cloud approaches showed reduced accuracy when handcrafted feature data were employed compared with the other settings. Overall, point cloud-based predictions were more sensitive to noise and model architecture than depth image-based predictions. Taken together, these results indicate that three-dimensional point clouds do not provide a consistent advantage over depth images for BCS prediction in dairy cattle under the evaluated conditions.

- **Summary**: Dense prediction infers per-pixel values from a single image and is fundamental to 3D perception and robotics. Although real-world scenes exhibit strong structure, existing methods treat it as an independent pixel-wise prediction, often resulting in structural inconsistencies. We propose SHED, a novel encoder-decoder architecture that enforces geometric prior explicitly by incorporating segmentation into dense prediction. By bidirectional hierarchical reasoning, segment tokens are hierarchically pooled in the encoder and unpooled in the decoder to reverse the hierarchy. The model is supervised only at the final output, allowing the segment hierarchy to emerge without explicit segmentation supervision. SHED improves depth boundary sharpness and segment coherence, while demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization from synthetic to the real-world environments. Its hierarchy-aware decoder better captures global 3D scene layouts, leading to improved semantic segmentation performance. Moreover, SHED enhances 3D reconstruction quality and reveals interpretable part-level structures that are often missed by conventional pixel-wise methods.

- **Summary**: Endoscopic image analysis is vital for colorectal cancer screening, yet real-world conditions often suffer from lens fogging, motion blur, and specular highlights, which severely compromise automated polyp detection. We propose EndoCaver, a lightweight transformer with a unidirectional-guided dual-decoder architecture, enabling joint multi-task capability for image deblurring and segmentation while significantly reducing computational complexity and model parameters. Specifically, it integrates a Global Attention Module (GAM) for cross-scale aggregation, a Deblurring-Segmentation Aligner (DSA) to transfer restoration cues, and a cosine-based scheduler (LoCoS) for stable multi-task optimisation. Experiments on the Kvasir-SEG dataset show that EndoCaver achieves 0.922 Dice on clean data and 0.889 under severe image degradation, surpassing state-of-the-art methods while reducing model parameters by 90%. These results demonstrate its efficiency and robustness, making it well-suited for on-device clinical deployment. Code is available at https://github.com/ReaganWu/EndoCaver.

- **Summary**: We present a hybrid cross-device localization pipeline developed for the CroCoDL 2025 Challenge. Our approach integrates a shared retrieval encoder and two complementary localization branches: a classical geometric branch using feature fusion and PnP, and a neural feed-forward branch (MapAnything) for metric localization conditioned on geometric inputs. A neural-guided candidate pruning strategy further filters unreliable map frames based on translation consistency, while depth-conditioned localization refines metric scale and translation precision on Spot scenes. These components jointly lead to significant improvements in recall and accuracy across both HYDRO and SUCCU benchmarks. Our method achieved a final score of 92.62 (R@0.5m, 5°) during the challenge.

- **Summary**: Understanding camera dynamics is a fundamental pillar of video spatial intelligence. However, existing multimodal models predominantly treat this task as a black-box classification, often confusing physically distinct motions by relying on superficial visual patterns rather than geometric cues. We present CamReasoner, a framework that reformulates camera movement understanding as a structured inference process to bridge the gap between perception and cinematic logic. Our approach centers on the Observation-Thinking-Answer (O-T-A) paradigm, which compels the model to decode spatio-temporal cues such as trajectories and view frustums within an explicit reasoning block. To instill this capability, we construct a Large-scale Inference Trajectory Suite comprising 18k SFT reasoning chains and 38k RL feedback samples. Notably, we are the first to employ RL for logical alignment in this domain, ensuring motion inferences are grounded in physical geometry rather than contextual guesswork. By applying Reinforcement Learning to the Observation-Think-Answer (O-T-A) reasoning paradigm, CamReasoner effectively suppresses hallucinations and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Selective prediction aims to endow predictors with a reject option, to avoid low confidence predictions. However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/kingston-aditya/MA-PaPSP.

- **Summary**: All-in-one weather image restoration methods are valuable in practice but depend on pre-collected data and require retraining for unseen degradations, leading to high cost. We propose DELNet, a continual learning framework for weather image restoration. DELNet integrates a judging valve that measures task similarity to distinguish new from known tasks, and a dynamic expert library that stores experts trained on different degradations. For new tasks, the valve selects top-k experts for knowledge transfer while adding new experts to capture task-specific features; for known tasks, the corresponding experts are directly reused. This design enables continuous optimization without retraining existing models. Experiments on OTS, Rain100H, and Snow100K demonstrate that DELNet surpasses state-of-the-art continual learning methods, achieving PSNR gains of 16\%, 11\%, and 12\%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of DELNet, which reduces retraining cost and enables practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Although Video Large Language Models perform remarkably well across tasks such as video understanding, question answering, and reasoning, they still suffer from the problem of hallucination, which refers to generating outputs that are inconsistent with explicit video content or factual evidence. However, existing decoding methods for mitigating video hallucinations, while considering the spatiotemporal characteristics of videos, mostly rely on heuristic designs. As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, but also preserves the general video understanding and reasoning capabilities of the model.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models excel at offline audio-visual understanding, but their ability to serve as mobile assistants in continuous real-world streams remains underexplored. In daily phone use, mobile assistants must track streaming audio-visual inputs and respond at the right time, yet existing benchmarks are often restricted to multiple-choice questions or use shorter videos. In this paper, we introduce PhoStream, the first mobile-centric streaming benchmark that unifies on-screen and off-screen scenarios to evaluate video, audio, and temporal reasoning. PhoStream contains 5,572 open-ended QA pairs from 578 videos across 4 scenarios and 10 capabilities. We build it with an Automated Generative Pipeline backed by rigorous human verification, and evaluate models using a realistic Online Inference Pipeline and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation for open-ended responses. Experiments reveal a temporal asymmetry in LLM-judged scores (0-100): models perform well on Instant and Backward tasks (Gemini 3 Pro exceeds 80), but drop sharply on Forward tasks (16.40), largely due to early responses before the required visual and audio cues appear. This highlights a fundamental limitation: current MLLMs struggle to decide when to speak, not just what to say. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/PhoStream.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, yet most defense methods to date rely on balanced data, overlooking the pervasive class imbalance in real-world scenarios that can amplify backdoor threats. This paper presents the first in-depth investigation of how the dataset imbalance amplifies backdoor vulnerability, showing that (i) the imbalance induces a majority-class bias that increases susceptibility and (ii) conventional defenses degrade significantly as the imbalance grows. To address this, we propose Randomized Probability Perturbation (RPP), a certified poisoned-sample detection framework that operates in a black-box setting using only model output probabilities. For any inspected sample, RPP determines whether the input has been backdoor-manipulated, while offering provable within-domain detectability guarantees and a probabilistic upper bound on the false positive rate. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet and ImageNet10) covering 10 backdoor attacks and 12 baseline defenses show that RPP achieves significantly higher detection accuracy than state-of-the-art defenses, particularly under dataset imbalance. RPP establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for defending against backdoor attacks in real-world environments with imbalanced data.

- **Summary**: This work proposes Bonnet, an ultra-fast sparse-volume pipeline for whole-body bone segmentation from CT scans. Accurate bone segmentation is important for surgical planning and anatomical analysis, but existing 3D voxel-based models such as nnU-Net and STU-Net require heavy computation and often take several minutes per scan, which limits time-critical use. The proposed Bonnet addresses this by integrating a series of novel framework components including HU-based bone thresholding, patch-wise inference with a sparse spconv-based U-Net, and multi-window fusion into a full-volume prediction. Trained on TotalSegmentator and evaluated without additional tuning on RibSeg, CT-Pelvic1K, and CT-Spine1K, Bonnet achieves high Dice across ribs, pelvis, and spine while running in only 2.69 seconds per scan on an RTX A6000. Compared to strong voxel baselines, Bonnet attains a similar accuracy but reduces inference time by roughly 25x on the same hardware and tiling setup. The toolkit and pre-trained models will be released at https://github.com/HINTLab/Bonnet.

- **Summary**: Although cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) for hyper-spectral image (HSI) classification has attracted significant research interest, existing works often rely on an unrealistic data augmentation procedure in the form of external noise to enlarge the sample size, thus greatly simplifying the issue of data scarcity. They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin. The source code of MIFOMO is open-sourced in https://github.com/Naeem- Paeedeh/MIFOMO for reproducibility and convenient further study.

- **Summary**: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers the advantages of reduced radiation dose and shortened scanning time. Traditional reconstruction algorithms exhibit various inherent limitations in LACT. Currently, most deep learning-based LACT reconstruction methods focus on multi-domain fusion or the introduction of generic priors, failing to fully align with the core imaging characteristics of LACT-such as the directionality of artifacts and directional loss of structural information, which are caused by the absence of projection angles in certain directions. Inspired by the theory of visible and invisible singularities, taking into account the aforementioned core imaging characteristics of LACT, we propose a Visible Singularities Guided Correlation network for LACT reconstruction (VSGC). The design philosophy of VSGC consists of two core steps: First, extract VS edge features from LACT images and focus the model's attention on these VS. Second, establish correlations between the VS edge features and other regions of the image. Additionally, a multi-scale loss function with anisotropic constraint is employed to constrain the model to converge in multiple aspects. Finally, qualitative and quantitative validations are conducted on both simulated and real datasets to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design. Particularly, in comparison with alternative methods, VSGC delivers more prominent performance in small angular ranges, with the PSNR improvement of 2.45 dB and the SSIM enhancement of 1.5\%. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yqx7150/VSGC.

- **Summary**: We introduce FOTBCD, a large-scale building change detection dataset derived from authoritative French orthophotos and topographic building data provided by IGN France. Unlike existing benchmarks that are geographically constrained to single cities or limited regions, FOTBCD spans 28 departments across mainland France, with 25 used for training and three geographically disjoint departments held out for evaluation. The dataset covers diverse urban, suburban, and rural environments at 0.2m/pixel resolution. We publicly release FOTBCD-Binary, a dataset comprising approximately 28,000 before/after image pairs with pixel-wise binary building change masks, each associated with patch-level spatial metadata. The dataset is designed for large-scale benchmarking and evaluation under geographic domain shift, with validation and test samples drawn from held-out departments and manually verified to ensure label quality. In addition, we publicly release FOTBCD-Instances, a publicly available instance-level annotated subset comprising several thousand image pairs, which illustrates the complete annotation schema used in the full instance-level version of FOTBCD. Using a fixed reference baseline, we benchmark FOTBCD-Binary against LEVIR-CD+ and WHU-CD, providing strong empirical evidence that geographic diversity at the dataset level is associated with improved cross-domain generalization in building change detection.

- **Summary**: This paper presents SurfelSoup, an end-to-end learned surface-based framework for point cloud geometry compression, with surface-structured primitives for representation. It proposes a probabilistic surface representation, pSurfel, which models local point occupancies using a bounded generalized Gaussian distribution. In addition, the pSurfels are organized into an octree-like hierarchy, pSurfelTree, with a Tree Decision module that adaptively terminates the tree subdivision for rate-distortion optimal Surfel granularity selection. This formulation avoids redundant point-wise compression in smooth regions and produces compact yet smooth surface reconstructions. Experimental results under the MPEG common test condition show consistent gain on geometry compression over voxel-based baselines and MPEG standard G-PCC-GesTM-TriSoup, while providing visually superior reconstructions with smooth and coherent surface structures.

- **Summary**: Streaming recurrent models enable efficient 3D reconstruction by maintaining persistent state representations. However, they suffer from catastrophic memory forgetting over long sequences due to balancing historical information with new observations. Recent methods alleviate this by deriving adaptive signals from attention perspective, but they operate on single dimensions without considering temporal and spatial consistency. To this end, we propose a training-free framework termed TTSA3R that leverages both temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality for adaptive state updates in 3D reconstruction. In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks. Moreover, our method exhibits only 15% error increase compared to over 200% degradation in baseline models on extended sequences, significantly improving long-term reconstruction stability. Our codes will be available soon.

- **Summary**: The growing adoption of robotics and augmented reality in real-world applications has driven considerable research interest in 3D object detection based on point clouds. While previous methods address unified training across multiple datasets, they fail to model geometric relationships in sparse point cloud scenes and ignore the feature distribution in significant areas, which ultimately restricts their performance. To deal with this issue, a unified 3D indoor detection framework, called UniGeo, is proposed. To model geometric relations in scenes, we first propose a geometry-aware learning module that establishes a learnable mapping from spatial relationships to feature weights, which enabes explicit geometric feature enhancement. Then, to further enhance point cloud feature representation, we propose a dynamic channel gating mechanism that leverages learnable channel-wise weighting. This mechanism adaptively optimizes features generated by the sparse 3D U-Net network, significantly enhancing key geometric information. Extensive experiments on six different indoor scene datasets clearly validate the superior performance of our method.

- **Summary**: Autoregressive models with continuous tokens form a promising paradigm for visual generation, especially for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, but they suffer from high computational cost. We study how to design compute-efficient linear attention within this framework. Specifically, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of scaling behavior with respect to parameter counts under different design choices, focusing on (1) normalization paradigms in linear attention (division-based vs. subtraction-based) and (2) depthwise convolution for locality augmentation.   Our results show that although subtraction-based normalization is effective for image classification, division-based normalization scales better for linear generative transformers. In addition, incorporating convolution for locality modeling plays a crucial role in autoregressive generation, consistent with findings in diffusion models.   We further extend gating mechanisms, commonly used in causal linear attention, to the bidirectional setting and propose a KV gate. By introducing data-independent learnable parameters to the key and value states, the KV gate assigns token-wise memory weights, enabling flexible memory management similar to forget gates in language models.   Based on these findings, we present LINA, a simple and compute-efficient T2I model built entirely on linear attention, capable of generating high-fidelity 1024x1024 images from user instructions. LINA achieves competitive performance on both class-conditional and T2I benchmarks, obtaining 2.18 FID on ImageNet (about 1.4B parameters) and 0.74 on GenEval (about 1.5B parameters). A single linear attention module reduces FLOPs by about 61 percent compared to softmax attention. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/techmonsterwang/LINA.

- **Summary**: The Semantic Gap Problem (SGP) in Computer Vision (CV) arises from the misalignment between visual and lexical semantics leading to flawed CV dataset design and CV benchmarks. This paper proposes that classification principles of S.R. Ranganathan can offer a principled starting point to address SGP and design high-quality CV datasets. We elucidate how these principles, suitably adapted, underpin the vTelos CV annotation methodology. The paper also briefly presents experimental evidence showing improvements in CV annotation and accuracy, thereby, validating vTelos.

- **Summary**: Gliomas are placing an increasingly clinical burden on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In the region, the median survival for patients remains under two years, and access to diagnostic imaging is extremely limited. These constraints highlight an urgent need for automated tools that can extract the maximum possible information from each available scan, tools that are specifically trained on local data, rather than adapted from high-income settings where conditions are vastly different. We utilize the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Africa 2025 Challenge dataset, an expert annotated collection of glioma MRIs. Our objectives are: (i) establish a strong baseline with nnUNet on this dataset, and (ii) explore whether the celebrated "grokking" phenomenon an abrupt, late training jump from memorization to superior generalization can be triggered to push performance without extra labels. We evaluate two training regimes. The first is a fast, budget-conscious approach that limits optimization to just a few epochs, reflecting the constrained GPU resources typically available in African institutions. Despite this limitation, nnUNet achieves strong Dice scores: 92.3% for whole tumor (WH), 86.6% for tumor core (TC), and 86.3% for enhancing tumor (ET). The second regime extends training well beyond the point of convergence, aiming to trigger a grokking-driven performance leap. With this approach, we were able to achieve grokking and enhanced our results to higher Dice scores: 92.2% for whole tumor (WH), 90.1% for tumor core (TC), and 90.2% for enhancing tumor (ET).

However, obtaining such paired supervision is challenging, as it requires either well-designed synthetic concepts or precise annotations from millions of training sources. To eliminate the need for costly paired annotations, in this paper, we explore the possibility of unsupervised synthetic image attribution. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised method called Alignment and Disentanglement. Specifically, we begin by performing basic concept alignment using contrastive self-supervised learning. Next, we enhance the model's attribution ability by promoting representation disentanglement with the Infomax loss. This approach is motivated by an interesting observation: contrastive self-supervised models, such as MoCo and DINO, inherently exhibit the ability to perform simple cross-domain alignment. By formulating this observation as a theoretical assumption on cross-covariance, we provide a theoretical explanation of how alignment and disentanglement can approximate the concept-matching process through a decomposition of the canonical correlation analysis objective. On the real-world benchmarks, AbC, we show that our unsupervised method surprisingly outperforms the supervised methods. As a starting point, we expect our intuitive insights and experimental findings to provide a fresh perspective on this challenging task.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary grounding requires accurate vision-language alignment under weak supervision, yet existing methods either rely on global sentence embeddings that lack fine-grained expressiveness or introduce token-level alignment with explicit supervision or heavy cross-attention designs. We propose ExpAlign, a theoretically grounded vision-language alignment framework built on a principled multiple instance learning formulation. ExpAlign introduces an Expectation Alignment Head that performs attention-based soft MIL pooling over token-region similarities, enabling implicit token and instance selection without additional annotations. To further stabilize alignment learning, we develop an energy-based multi-scale consistency regularization scheme, including a Top-K multi-positive contrastive objective and a Geometry-Aware Consistency Objective derived from a Lagrangian-constrained free-energy minimization. Extensive experiments show that ExpAlign consistently improves open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation, particularly on long-tail categories. Most notably, it achieves 36.2 AP$_r$ on the LVIS minival split, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at comparable model scale, while remaining lightweight and inference-efficient.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer from high computational costs due to excessive visual tokens, particularly in high-resolution and video-based scenarios. Existing token reduction methods typically focus on isolated pipeline components and often neglect textual alignment, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VisionTrim, a unified framework for training-free MLLM acceleration, integrating two effective plug-and-play modules: 1) the Dominant Vision Token Selection (DVTS) module, which preserves essential visual tokens via a global-local view, and 2) the Text-Guided Vision Complement (TGVC) module, which facilitates context-aware token merging guided by textual cues. Extensive experiments across diverse image and video multimodal benchmarks demonstrate the performance superiority of our VisionTrim, advancing practical MLLM deployment in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained traction in vision due to their energy efficiency, bio-plausibility, and inherent temporal processing. Yet, despite this temporal capacity, most progress concentrates on static image benchmarks, and SNNs still underperform on dynamic video tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes. PBO deliberately suppresses static components that contribute little to discrimination, effectively high passing the stream so that spiking activity concentrates on motion bearing content. On UCF101, PBO yields over ten percentage points improvement. On more complex multi-modal action recognition and weakly supervised video anomaly detection, PBO delivers consistent and significant gains, offering a new perspective for SNN based video processing and understanding.

- **Summary**: Consistency models have been proposed for fast generative modeling, achieving results competitive with diffusion and flow models. However, these methods exhibit inherent instability and limited reproducibility when training from scratch, motivating subsequent work to explain and stabilize these issues. While these efforts have provided valuable insights, the explanations remain fragmented, and the theoretical relationships remain unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical examination of consistency models by analyzing them from a flow map-based perspective. This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization. We further demonstrate that our strategy extends beyond image generation to diffusion-based policy learning, without reliance on a pretrained diffusion model for initialization, thereby illustrating its broader applicability.

- **Summary**: We introduce the Visual Personalization Turing Test (VPTT), a new paradigm for evaluating contextual visual personalization based on perceptual indistinguishability, rather than identity replication. A model passes the VPTT if its output (image, video, 3D asset, etc.) is indistinguishable to a human or calibrated VLM judge from content a given person might plausibly create or share. To operationalize VPTT, we present the VPTT Framework, integrating a 10k-persona benchmark (VPTT-Bench), a visual retrieval-augmented generator (VPRAG), and the VPTT Score, a text-only metric calibrated against human and VLM judgments. We show high correlation across human, VLM, and VPTT evaluations, validating the VPTT Score as a reliable perceptual proxy. Experiments demonstrate that VPRAG achieves the best alignment-originality balance, offering a scalable and privacy-safe foundation for personalized generative AI.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot out-of-vocabulary detection (ZS-OOVD) aims to accurately recognize objects of in-vocabulary (IV) categories provided at zero-shot inference, while simultaneously rejecting undefined ones (out-of-vocabulary, OOV) that lack corresponding category prompts. However, previous methods are prone to overfitting the IV classes, leading to the OOV or undefined classes being misclassified as IV ones with a high confidence score. To address this issue, this paper proposes a zero-shot OOV detector (OOVDet), a novel framework that effectively detects predefined classes while reliably rejecting undefined ones in zero-shot scenes. Specifically, due to the model's lack of prior knowledge about the distribution of OOV data, we synthesize region-level OOV prompts by sampling from the low-likelihood regions of the class-conditional Gaussian distributions in the hidden space, motivated by the assumption that unknown semantics are more likely to emerge in low-density areas of the latent space. For OOV images, we further propose a Dirichlet-based gradient attribution mechanism to mine pseudo-OOV image samples, where the attribution gradients are interpreted as Dirichlet evidence to estimate prediction uncertainty, and samples with high uncertainty are selected as pseudo-OOV images. Building on these synthesized OOV prompts and pseudo-OOV images, we construct the OOV decision boundary through a low-density prior constraint, which regularizes the optimization of OOV classes using Gaussian kernel density estimation in accordance with the above assumption.   Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the OOV detection performance in zero-shot scenes. The code is available at https://github.com/binyisu/OOV-detector.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing detailed 3D human meshes from a single in-the-wild image remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing SMPLX-based methods often suffer from slow inference, produce only coarse body poses, and exhibit misalignments or unnatural artifacts in fine-grained regions such as the face and hands. These issues make current approaches difficult to apply to downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PEAR-a fast and robust framework for pixel-aligned expressive human mesh recovery. PEAR explicitly tackles three major limitations of existing methods: slow inference, inaccurate localization of fine-grained human pose details, and insufficient facial expression capture. Specifically, to enable real-time SMPLX parameter inference, we depart from prior designs that rely on high resolution inputs or multi-branch architectures. Instead, we adopt a clean and unified ViT-based model capable of recovering coarse 3D human geometry. To compensate for the loss of fine-grained details caused by this simplified architecture, we introduce pixel-level supervision to optimize the geometry, significantly improving the reconstruction accuracy of fine-grained human details. To make this approach practical, we further propose a modular data annotation strategy that enriches the training data and enhances the robustness of the model. Overall, PEAR is a preprocessing-free framework that can simultaneously infer EHM-s (SMPLX and scaled-FLAME) parameters at over 100 FPS. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to previous SMPLX-based approaches.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong zero-shot performance via large-scale image-text pretraining and have been widely adopted in medical image analysis. However, existing VLMs remain notably weak at understanding negated clinical statements, largely due to contrastive alignment objectives that treat negation as a minor linguistic variation rather than a meaning-inverting operator. In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference. Experiments on ChestXray14, Open-I, CheXpert, and PadChest show that Bi-MCQ improves negation understanding by up to 0.47 AUC over the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art CARZero model, while achieving up to a 0.08 absolute gain on positive-negative combined (PNC) evaluation. Additionally, Bi-MCQ reduces the affirmative-negative AUC gap by an average of 0.12 compared to InfoNCE-based fine-tuning, demonstrating that objective reformulation can substantially enhance negation understanding in medical VLMs.

- **Summary**: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is a critical safeguard for deploying machine learning models in the real world. However, most post-hoc detection methods operate on penultimate feature representations derived from global average pooling (GAP) -- a lossy operation that discards valuable distributional statistics from activation maps prior to global average pooling. We contend that these overlooked statistics, particularly channel-wise variance and dominant (maximum) activations, are highly discriminative for OOD detection. We introduce DAVIS, a simple and broadly applicable post-hoc technique that enriches feature vectors by incorporating these crucial statistics, directly addressing the information loss from GAP. Extensive evaluations show DAVIS sets a new benchmark across diverse architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet. It achieves significant reductions in the false positive rate (FPR95), with improvements of 48.26\% on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18, 38.13\% on CIFAR-100 using ResNet-34, and 26.83\% on ImageNet-1k benchmarks using MobileNet-v2. Our analysis reveals the underlying mechanism for this improvement, providing a principled basis for moving beyond the mean in OOD detection.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong multimodal performance but are costly to deploy, and post-training quantization often causes significant accuracy loss. Despite its potential, quantization-aware training for VLMs remains underexplored. We propose GRACE, a framework unifying knowledge distillation and QAT under the Information Bottleneck principle: quantization constrains information capacity while distillation guides what to preserve within this budget. Treating the teacher as a proxy for task-relevant information, we introduce confidence-gated decoupled distillation to filter unreliable supervision, relational centered kernel alignment to transfer visual token structures, and an adaptive controller via Lagrangian relaxation to balance fidelity against capacity constraints. Across extensive benchmarks on LLaVA and Qwen families, our INT4 models consistently outperform FP16 baselines (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B: 70.1 vs. 66.8 on SQA; Qwen2-VL-2B: 76.9 vs. 72.6 on MMBench), nearly matching teacher performance. Using real INT4 kernel, we achieve 3$\times$ throughput with 54% memory reduction. This principled framework significantly outperforms existing quantization methods, making GRACE a compelling solution for resource-constrained deployment.

- **Summary**: Early-exit neural networks have become popular for reducing inference latency by allowing intermediate predictions when sufficient confidence is achieved. However, standard approaches typically rely on single-model confidence thresholds, which are frequently unreliable due to inherent calibration issues. To address this, we introduce SQUAD (Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions), the first inference scheme that integrates early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, improving uncertainty estimation while reducing the inference time. Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy.

- **Summary**: Latent Action Models (LAMs) have rapidly gained traction as an important component in the pre-training pipelines of leading Vision-Language-Action models. However, they fail when observations contain action-correlated distractors, often encoding noise instead of meaningful latent actions. Humans, on the other hand, can effortlessly distinguish task-relevant motions from irrelevant details in any video given only a brief task description. In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones. Finally, we show that simply asking VLMs to ignore distractors can substantially improve latent action quality, yielding up to a six-fold increase in downstream success rates on Distracting MetaWorld.

- **Summary**: Deep learning agents can achieve high performance in complex game domains without often understanding the underlying causal game mechanics. To address this, we investigate Causal Induction: the ability to infer governing laws from observational data, by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) with reverse-engineering Video Game Description Language (VGDL) rules from gameplay traces. To reduce redundancy, we select nine representative games from the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework using semantic embeddings and clustering. We compare two approaches to VGDL generation: direct code generation from observations, and a two-stage method that first infers a structural causal model (SCM) and then translates it into VGDL. Both approaches are evaluated across multiple prompting strategies and controlled context regimes, varying the amount and form of information provided to the model, from just raw gameplay observations to partial VGDL specifications. Results show that the SCM-based approach more often produces VGDL descriptions closer to the ground truth than direct generation, achieving preference win rates of up to 81\% in blind evaluations and yielding fewer logically inconsistent rules. These learned SCMs can be used for downstream use cases such as causal reinforcement learning, interpretable agents, and procedurally generating novel but logically consistent games.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly elevated the visual fidelity of Virtual Try-On (VTON) systems, yet reliable evaluation remains a persistent bottleneck. Traditional metrics struggle to quantify fine-grained texture details and semantic consistency, while existing datasets fail to meet commercial standards in scale and diversity. We present OpenVTON-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising approximately 100K high-resolution image pairs (up to $1536 \times 1536$). The dataset is constructed using DINOv3-based hierarchical clustering for semantically balanced sampling and Gemini-powered dense captioning, ensuring a uniform distribution across 20 fine-grained garment categories. To support reliable evaluation, we propose a multi-modal protocol that measures VTON quality along five interpretable dimensions: background consistency, identity fidelity, texture fidelity, shape plausibility, and overall realism. The protocol integrates VLM-based semantic reasoning with a novel Multi-Scale Representation Metric based on SAM3 segmentation and morphological erosion, enabling the separation of boundary alignment errors from internal texture artifacts. Experimental results show strong agreement with human judgments (Kendall's $τ$ of 0.833 vs. 0.611 for SSIM), establishing a robust benchmark for VTON evaluation.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models learn a time-indexed score field $\mathbf{s}_θ(\mathbf{x}_t,t)$ that often inherits approximate equivariances (flips, rotations, circular shifts) from in-distribution (ID) data and convolutional backbones. Most diffusion-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors exploit score magnitude or local geometry (energies, curvature, covariance spectra) and largely ignore equivariances. We introduce Group-Equivariant Posterior Consistency (GEPC), a training-free probe that measures how consistently the learned score transforms under a finite group $\mathcal{G}$, detecting equivariance breaking even when score magnitude remains unchanged. At the population level, we propose the ideal GEPC residual, which averages an equivariance-residual functional over $\mathcal{G}$, and we derive ID upper bounds and OOD lower bounds under mild assumptions. GEPC requires only score evaluations and produces interpretable equivariance-breaking maps. On OOD image benchmark datasets, we show that GEPC achieves competitive or improved AUROC compared to recent diffusion-based baselines while remaining computationally lightweight. On high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery where OOD corresponds to targets or anomalies in clutter, GEPC yields strong target-background separation and visually interpretable equivariance-breaking maps.

- **Summary**: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a pivotal task in autonomous driving, providing a dense and fine-grained understanding of the surrounding environment, yet single-modality methods face trade-offs between camera semantics and LiDAR geometry. Existing multi-modal frameworks often struggle with modality heterogeneity, spatial misalignment, and the representation crisis--where voxels are computationally heavy and BEV alternatives are lossy. We present GaussianOcc3D, a multi-modal framework bridging camera and LiDAR through a memory-efficient, continuous 3D Gaussian representation. We introduce four modules: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), using depth-wise deformable sampling to lift sparse signals onto Gaussian primitives; (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing (EBFS) to mitigate domain noise; (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion (ACLF) with uncertainty-aware reweighting for sensor reliability; and (4) a Gauss-Mamba Head leveraging Selective State Space Models for global context with linear complexity. Evaluations on Occ3D, SurroundOcc, and SemanticKITTI benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving mIoU scores of 49.4%, 28.9%, and 25.2% respectively. GaussianOcc3D exhibits superior robustness across challenging rainy and nighttime conditions.

- **Summary**: Compressing long chains of thought (CoT) into compact latent tokens is crucial for efficient reasoning with large language models (LLMs). Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the two versions of ImgCoT.

- **Summary**: Modern deep learning-based inpainting enables realistic local image manipulation, raising critical challenges for reliable detection. However, we observe that current detectors primarily rely on global artifacts that appear as inpainting side effects, rather than on locally synthesized content. We show that this behavior occurs because VAE-based reconstruction induces a subtle but pervasive spectral shift across the entire image, including unedited regions. To isolate this effect, we introduce Inpainting Exchange (INP-X), an operation that restores original pixels outside the edited region while preserving all synthesized content. We create a 90K test dataset including real, inpainted, and exchanged images to evaluate this phenomenon. Under this intervention, pretrained state-of-the-art detectors, including commercial ones, exhibit a dramatic drop in accuracy (e.g., from 91\% to 55\%), frequently approaching chance level. We provide a theoretical analysis linking this behavior to high-frequency attenuation caused by VAE information bottlenecks. Our findings highlight the need for content-aware detection. Indeed, training on our dataset yields better generalization and localization than standard inpainting. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/emirhanbilgic/INP-X.

- **Summary**: This study addresses the demand for real-time detection of tomatoes and tomato flowers by agricultural robots deployed on edge devices in greenhouse environments. Under practical imaging conditions, object detection systems often face challenges such as large scale variations caused by varying camera distances, severe occlusion from plant structures, and highly imbalanced class distributions. These factors make conventional object detection approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets difficult to simultaneously achieve high detection accuracy and deployment efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes an active learning driven lightweight object detection framework, integrating data analysis, model design, and training strategy. First, the size distribution of objects in raw agricultural images is analyzed to redefine an operational target range, thereby improving learning stability under real-world conditions. Second, an efficient feature extraction module is incorporated to reduce computational cost, while a lightweight attention mechanism is introduced to enhance feature representation under multi-scale and occluded scenarios. Finally, an active learning strategy is employed to iteratively select high-information samples for annotation and training under a limited labeling budget, effectively improving the recognition performance of minority and small-object categories. Experimental results demonstrate that, while maintaining a low parameter count and inference cost suitable for edge-device deployment, the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of tomatoes and tomato flowers in raw images. Under limited annotation conditions, the framework achieves an overall detection accuracy of 67.8% mAP, validating its practicality and feasibility for intelligent agricultural applications.

- **Summary**: Robust safety of vision-language large models (VLLMs) under joint multilingual and multimodal inputs remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks are typically multilingual but text-only, or multimodal but monolingual. Recent multilingual multimodal red-teaming efforts render harmful prompts into images, yet rely heavily on typography-style visuals and lack semantically grounded image-text pairs, limiting coverage of realistic cross-modal interactions. We introduce Lingua-SafetyBench, a benchmark of 100,440 harmful image-text pairs across 10 languages, explicitly partitioned into image-dominant and text-dominant subsets to disentangle risk sources. Evaluating 11 open-source VLLMs reveals a consistent asymmetry: image-dominant risks yield higher ASR in high-resource languages, while text-dominant risks are more severe in non-high-resource languages. A controlled study on the Qwen series shows that scaling and version upgrades reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) overall but disproportionately benefit HRLs, widening the gap between HRLs and Non-HRLs under text-dominant risks. This underscores the necessity of language- and modality-aware safety alignment beyond mere scaling.To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we will publicly release our benchmark, model checkpoints, and source code.The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/zsxr15/Lingua-SafetyBench.Warning: this paper contains examples with unsafe content.

- **Summary**: Live streaming platforms require real-time monitoring and reaction to social signals, utilizing partial and asynchronous evidence from video, text, and audio. We propose StreamSense, a streaming detector that couples a lightweight streaming encoder with selective routing to a Vision-Language Model (VLM) expert. StreamSense handles most timestamps with the lightweight streaming encoder, escalates hard/ambiguous cases to the VLM, and defers decisions when context is insufficient. The encoder is trained using (i) a cross-modal contrastive term to align visual/audio cues with textual signals, and (ii) an IoU-weighted loss that down-weights poorly overlapping target segments, mitigating label interference across segment boundaries. We evaluate StreamSense on multiple social streaming detection tasks (e.g., sentiment classification and hate content moderation), and the results show that StreamSense achieves higher accuracy than VLM-only streaming while only occasionally invoking the VLM, thereby reducing average latency and compute. Our results indicate that selective escalation and deferral are effective primitives for understanding streaming social tasks. Code is publicly available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based face swapping achieves state-of-the-art performance, yet it also exacerbates the potential harm of malicious face swapping to violate portraiture right or undermine personal reputation. This has spurred the development of proactive defense methods. However, existing approaches face a core trade-off: large perturbations distort facial structures, while small ones weaken protection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose FaceDefense, an enhanced proactive defense framework against diffusion-based face swapping. Our method introduces a new diffusion loss to strengthen the defensive efficacy of adversarial examples, and employs a directional facial attribute editing to restore perturbation-induced distortions, thereby enhancing visual imperceptibility. A two-phase alternating optimization strategy is designed to generate final perturbed face images. Extensive experiments show that FaceDefense significantly outperforms existing methods in both imperceptibility and defense effectiveness, achieving a superior trade-off.

- **Summary**: Industrial troubleshooting guides encode diagnostic procedures in flowchart-like diagrams where spatial layout and technical language jointly convey meaning. To integrate this knowledge into operator support systems, which assist shop-floor personnel in diagnosing and resolving equipment issues, the information must first be extracted and structured for machine interpretation. However, when performed manually, this extraction is labor-intensive and error-prone. Vision Language Models offer potential to automate this process by jointly interpreting visual and textual meaning, yet their performance on such guides remains underexplored. This paper evaluates two VLMs on extracting structured knowledge, comparing two prompting strategies: standard instruction-guided versus an augmented approach that cues troubleshooting layout patterns. Results reveal model-specific trade-offs between layout sensitivity and semantic robustness, informing practical deployment decisions.



### Is Training Necessary for Anomaly Detection?

- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) methods rely on training encoder-decoder models to reconstruct anomaly-free features. We first show these approaches have an inherent fidelity-stability dilemma in how they detect anomalies via reconstruction residuals. We then abandon the reconstruction paradigm entirely and propose Retrieval-based Anomaly Detection (RAD). RAD is a training-free approach that stores anomaly-free features in a memory and detects anomalies through multi-level retrieval, matching test patches against the memory. Experiments demonstrate that RAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across four established benchmarks (MVTec-AD, VisA, Real-IAD, 3D-ADAM) under both standard and few-shot settings. On MVTec-AD, RAD reaches 96.7\% Pixel AUROC with just a single anomaly-free image compared to 98.5\% of RAD's full-data performance. We further prove that retrieval-based scores theoretically upper-bound reconstruction-residual scores. Collectively, these findings overturn the assumption that MUAD requires task-specific training, showing that state-of-the-art anomaly detection is feasible with memory-based retrieval.

- **Summary**: As realistic AI-generated images threaten digital authenticity, we address the generalization failure of generative artifact-based detectors by exploiting the intrinsic properties of the camera imaging pipeline. Concretely, we investigate color correlations induced by the color filter array (CFA) and demosaicing, and propose a Demosaicing-guided Color Correlation Training (DCCT) framework for AI-generated image detection. By simulating the CFA sampling pattern, we decompose each color image into a single-channel input (as the condition) and the remaining two channels as the ground-truth targets (for prediction). A self-supervised U-Net is trained to model the conditional distribution of the missing channels from the given one, parameterized via a mixture of logistic functions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DCCT targets a provable distributional difference in color-correlation features between photographic and AI-generated images. By leveraging these distinct features to construct a binary classifier, DCCT achieves state-of-the-art generalization and robustness, significantly outperforming prior methods across over 20 unseen generators.

- **Summary**: Large-scale biodiversity monitoring platforms increasingly rely on multimodal wildlife observations. While recent foundation models enable rich semantic representations across vision, audio, and language, retrieving relevant observations from massive archives remains challenging due to the computational cost of high-dimensional similarity search. In this work, we introduce compact hypercube embeddings for fast text-based wildlife observation retrieval, a framework that enables efficient text-based search over large-scale wildlife image and audio databases using compact binary representations. Building on the cross-view code alignment hashing framework, we extend lightweight hashing beyond a single-modality setup to align natural language descriptions with visual or acoustic observations in a shared Hamming space. Our approach leverages pretrained wildlife foundation models, including BioCLIP and BioLingual, and adapts them efficiently for hashing using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on large-scale benchmarks, including iNaturalist2024 for text-to-image retrieval and iNatSounds2024 for text-to-audio retrieval, as well as multiple soundscape datasets to assess robustness under domain shift. Results show that retrieval using discrete hypercube embeddings achieves competitive, and in several cases superior, performance compared to continuous embeddings, while drastically reducing memory and search cost. Moreover, we observe that the hashing objective consistently improves the underlying encoder representations, leading to stronger retrieval and zero-shot generalization. These results demonstrate that binary, language-based retrieval enables scalable and efficient search over large wildlife archives for biodiversity monitoring systems.

- **Summary**: The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, defined as a significant increase in temperature in urban environments compared to surrounding areas, is difficult to study in real cities using sensor data (satellites or in-situ stations) due to their coarse spatial and temporal resolution. Among the factors contributing to this effect are the properties of urban materials, which differ from those in rural areas. To analyze their individual impact and to test new material configurations, a high-resolution simulation at the city scale is required. Estimating the current materials used in a city, including those on building facades, is also challenging. We propose HeatMat, an approach to analyze at high resolution the individual impact of urban materials on the UHI effect in a real city, relying only on open data. We estimate building materials using street-view images and a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to supplement existing OpenStreetMap data, which describes the 2D geometry and features of buildings. We further encode this information into a set of 2D maps that represent the city's vertical structure and material characteristics. These maps serve as inputs for our 2.5D simulator, which models coupled heat transfers and enables random-access surface temperature estimation at multiple resolutions, reaching an x20 speedup compared to an equivalent simulation in 3D.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in image-based satellite 3D reconstruction have progressed along two complementary directions. On one hand, multi-date approaches using NeRF or Gaussian-splatting jointly model appearance and geometry across many acquisitions, achieving accurate reconstructions on opportunistic imagery with numerous observations. On the other hand, classical stereoscopic reconstruction pipelines deliver robust and scalable results for simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous image pairs. However, when the two images are captured months apart, strong seasonal, illumination, and shadow changes violate standard stereoscopic assumptions, causing existing pipelines to fail. This work presents the first Diachronic Stereo Matching method for satellite imagery, enabling reliable 3D reconstruction from temporally distant pairs. Two advances make this possible: (1) fine-tuning a state-of-the-art deep stereo network that leverages monocular depth priors, and (2) exposing it to a dataset specifically curated to include a diverse set of diachronic image pairs. In particular, we start from a pretrained MonSter model, trained initially on a mix of synthetic and real datasets such as SceneFlow and KITTI, and fine-tune it on a set of stereo pairs derived from the DFC2019 remote sensing challenge. This dataset contains both synchronic and diachronic pairs under diverse seasonal and illumination conditions. Experiments on multi-date WorldView-3 imagery demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses classical pipelines and unadapted deep stereo models on both synchronic and diachronic settings. Fine-tuning on temporally diverse images, together with monocular priors, proves essential for enabling 3D reconstruction from previously incompatible acquisition dates.

- **Summary**: Existing methods for farmland remote sensing image (FRSI) segmentation generally follow a static segmentation paradigm, where analysis relies solely on the limited information contained within a single input patch. Consequently, their reasoning capability is limited when dealing with complex scenes characterized by ambiguity and visual uncertainty. In contrast, human experts, when interpreting remote sensing images in such ambiguous cases, tend to actively query auxiliary images (such as higher-resolution, larger-scale, or temporally adjacent data) to conduct cross-verification and achieve more comprehensive reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a reasoning-query-driven dynamic segmentation framework for FRSIs, named FarmMind. This framework breaks through the limitations of the static segmentation paradigm by introducing a reasoning-query mechanism, which dynamically and on-demand queries external auxiliary images to compensate for the insufficient information in a single input image. Unlike direct queries, this mechanism simulates the thinking process of human experts when faced with segmentation ambiguity: it first analyzes the root causes of segmentation ambiguities through reasoning, and then determines what type of auxiliary image needs to be queried based on this analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FarmMind achieves superior segmentation performance and stronger generalization ability compared with existing methods.

- **Summary**: Continual learning (CL) in vision-language models (VLMs) faces significant challenges in improving task adaptation and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization. Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators. The merged LoRAs retain less weights and incur no inference latency, making our method computationally lightweight.

- **Summary**: Reliable environmental perception remains one of the main obstacles for safe operation of automated vehicles. Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) concerns safety risks from perception insufficiencies, particularly under adverse conditions where conventional detectors often falter. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising semantic reasoning, their quantitative effectiveness for safety-critical 2D object detection is underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ten representative LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, a benchmark specifically curated for long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations. Performance is quantitatively compared against the classical perception approach, a YOLO-based detector. Experimental results reveal a critical trade-off: top-performing LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) surpass the YOLO baseline in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, exhibiting superior robustness to visual degradation. Conversely, the baseline retains an advantage in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of semantic reasoning versus geometric regression, supporting the use of LVLMs as high-level safety validators in SOTIF-oriented automated driving systems.

- **Summary**: VQ-based image generation typically follows a two-stage pipeline: a tokenizer encodes images into discrete tokens, and a generative model learns their dependencies for reconstruction. However, improved tokenization in the first stage does not necessarily enhance the second-stage generation, as existing methods fail to constrain token dependencies. This mismatch forces the generative model to learn from unordered distributions, leading to bias and weak coherence. To address this, we propose native visual tokenization, which enforces causal dependencies during tokenization. Building on this idea, we introduce NativeTok, a framework that achieves efficient reconstruction while embedding relational constraints within token sequences. NativeTok consists of: (1) a Meta Image Transformer (MIT) for latent image modeling, and (2) a Mixture of Causal Expert Transformer (MoCET), where each lightweight expert block generates a single token conditioned on prior tokens and latent features. We further design a Hierarchical Native Training strategy that updates only new expert blocks, ensuring training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NativeTok.

- **Summary**: This work aims to address a novel Customized Virtual Try-ON (Cu-VTON) task, enabling the superimposition of a specified garment onto a model that can be customized in terms of appearance, posture, and additional attributes. Compared with traditional VTON task, it enables users to tailor digital avatars to their individual preferences, thereby enhancing the virtual fitting experience with greater flexibility and engagement. To address this task, we introduce a Neural Clothing Tryer (NCT) framework, which exploits the advanced diffusion models equipped with semantic enhancement and controlling modules to better preserve semantic characterization and textural details of the garment and meanwhile facilitating the flexible editing of the model's postures and appearances. Specifically, NCT introduces a semantic-enhanced module to take semantic descriptions of garments and utilizes a visual-language encoder to learn aligned features across modalities. The aligned features are served as condition input to the diffusion model to enhance the preservation of the garment's semantics. Then, a semantic controlling module is designed to take the garment image, tailored posture image, and semantic description as input to maintain garment details while simultaneously editing model postures, expressions, and various attributes. Extensive experiments on the open available benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed NCT framework.

- **Summary**: Large-scale foundation models (FMs) in remote sensing (RS) are developed based on the paradigms established in computer vision (CV) and have shown promise for various Earth observation applications. However, the direct transfer of scaling assumptions from CV to RS has not been adequately examined. We hypothesize that RS FMs enter an overparameterized regime at substantially smaller scales than their CV counterparts, where increasing parameter count primarily induces redundant representations rather than qualitatively new abstractions. To test this hypothesis, we use post-hoc slimming, where we uniformly reduce the width of pretrained encoder, as a tool to measure representational redundancy across six state-of-the-art RS FMs on four downstream classification tasks. Our findings reveal a significant contrast with those in the CV domain: while a post-hoc slimmed masked autoencoder (MAE) trained on ImageNet retains less than 10% accuracy at 1% FLOPs, RS FMs maintain over 71% relative accuracy at the same budget. This sevenfold difference provides strong empirical support for our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that learned slimmable training can improve both Momentum Contrast (MoCo)- and MAE- based models. In addition, through the explained variance ratio and the feature correlation analysis, we provide mechanistic explanations showing that RS FMs distribute task-relevant information with high redundancy. Our findings establish post-hoc slimmability as both a practical deployment strategy for resource-constrained environments and a diagnostic tool that challenges the prevailing scaling paradigm in RS. Upon acceptance, we will publish all code.

- **Summary**: Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet its practical deployment is often hindered by incomplete multimodal data. Existing incomplete MDL methods either discard missing modalities, risking the loss of valuable task-relevant information, or recover them, potentially introducing irrelevant noise, leading to the discarding-imputation dilemma. To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose DyMo, a new inference-time dynamic modality selection framework that adaptively identifies and integrates reliable recovered modalities, fully exploring task-relevant information beyond the conventional discard-or-impute paradigm. Central to DyMo is a novel selection algorithm that maximizes multimodal task-relevant information for each test sample. Since direct estimation of such information at test time is intractable due to the unknown data distribution, we theoretically establish a connection between information and the task loss, which we compute at inference time as a tractable proxy. Building on this, a novel principled reward function is proposed to guide modality selection. In addition, we design a flexible multimodal network architecture compatible with arbitrary modality combinations, alongside a tailored training strategy for robust representation learning. Extensive experiments on diverse natural and medical image datasets show that DyMo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete/dynamic MDL methods across various missing-data scenarios.

- **Summary**: Mapping the terrain and understory hidden beneath dense forest canopies is of great interest for numerous applications such as search and rescue, trail mapping, forest inventory tasks, and more. Existing solutions rely on specialized sensors: either heavy, costly airborne LiDAR, or Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), which uses thermal synthetic aperture photography and is tailored for person detection.   We introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of canopy-free, photorealistic ground views using only conventional RGB images. Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.   To validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images). Additionally, we show the potential of our approach for forest inventory tasks like tree counting. These results position our approach as a cost-effective, high-resolution alternative to specialized sensors for SAR, trail mapping, and forest-inventory tasks.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection is often formulated under the assumption that abnormality is an intrinsic property of an observation, independent of context. This assumption breaks down in many real-world settings, where the same object or action may be normal or anomalous depending on latent contextual factors (e.g., running on a track versus on a highway). We revisit \emph{contextual anomaly detection}, classically defined as context-dependent abnormality, and operationalize it in the visual domain, where anomaly labels depend on subject--context compatibility rather than intrinsic appearance. To enable systematic study of this setting, we introduce CAAD-3K, a benchmark that isolates contextual anomalies by controlling subject identity while varying context. We further propose a conditional compatibility learning framework that leverages vision--language representations to model subject--context relationships under limited supervision. Our method substantially outperforms existing approaches on CAAD-3K and achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec-AD and VisA, demonstrating that modeling context dependence complements traditional structural anomaly detection. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Underwater images suffer severe degradation due to wavelength-dependent attenuation, scattering, and illumination non-uniformity that vary across water types and depths. We propose an unsupervised Domain-Invariant Visual Enhancement and Restoration (DIVER) framework that integrates empirical correction with physics-guided modeling for robust underwater image enhancement. DIVER first applies either IlluminateNet for adaptive luminance enhancement or a Spectral Equalization Filter for spectral normalization. An Adaptive Optical Correction Module then refines hue and contrast using channel-adaptive filtering, while Hydro-OpticNet employs physics-constrained learning to compensate for backscatter and wavelength-dependent attenuation. The parameters of IlluminateNet and Hydro-OpticNet are optimized via unsupervised learning using a composite loss function. DIVER is evaluated on eight diverse datasets covering shallow, deep, and highly turbid environments, including both naturally low-light and artificially illuminated scenes, using reference and non-reference metrics. While state-of-the-art methods such as WaterNet, UDNet, and Phaseformer perform reasonably in shallow water, their performance degrades in deep, unevenly illuminated, or artificially lit conditions. In contrast, DIVER consistently achieves best or near-best performance across all datasets, demonstrating strong domain-invariant capability. DIVER yields at least a 9% improvement over SOTA methods in UCIQE. On the low-light SeaThru dataset, where color-palette references enable direct evaluation of color restoration, DIVER achieves at least a 4.9% reduction in GPMAE compared to existing methods. Beyond visual quality, DIVER also improves robotic perception by enhancing ORB-based keypoint repeatability and matching performance, confirming its robustness across diverse underwater environments.

- **Summary**: Autoregressive sequence modeling stands as the cornerstone of modern Generative AI, powering results across diverse modalities ranging from text generation to image generation. However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation. In both domains, MoVE yields consistent performance improvements over standard and layer-wise memory baselines, enabling the construction of "memory-dense" models that achieve lower perplexity and higher fidelity than their dense counterparts at comparable compute budgets.

- **Summary**: The semi-supervised semantic segmentation (S4) can learn rich visual knowledge from low-cost unlabeled images. However, traditional S4 architectures all face the challenge of low-quality pseudo-labels, especially for the teacher-student framework.We propose a novel SemiEarth model that introduces vision-language models (VLMs) to address the S4 issues for the remote sensing (RS) domain. Specifically, we invent a VLM pseudo-label purifying (VLM-PP) structure to purify the teacher network's pseudo-labels, achieving substantial improvements. Especially in multi-class boundary regions of RS images, the VLM-PP module can significantly improve the quality of pseudo-labels generated by the teacher, thereby correctly guiding the student model's learning. Moreover, since VLM-PP equips VLMs with open-world capabilities and is independent of the S4 architecture, it can correct mispredicted categories in low-confidence pseudo-labels whenever a discrepancy arises between its prediction and the pseudo-label. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple RS datasets, which demonstrate that our SemiEarth achieves SOTA performance. More importantly, unlike previous SOTA RS S4 methods, our model not only achieves excellent performance but also offers good interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/wangshanwen001/SemiEarth.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have explored using pretrained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) such as DINO for generative autoencoders, showing strong generative performance. Unfortunately, existing approaches often suffer from limited reconstruction fidelity due to the loss of high-frequency details. In this work, we present the DINO Spherical Autoencoder (DINO-SAE), a framework that bridges semantic representation and pixel-level reconstruction. Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM. Notably, our Riemannian Flow Matching-based DiT exhibits efficient convergence, achieving a gFID of 3.47 at 80 epochs.

- **Summary**: Visual anomaly detection in real-world industrial settings faces two major limitations. First, most existing methods are trained on purely normal data or on unlabeled datasets assumed to be predominantly normal, presuming the absence of contamination, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice. Second, they assume no access to labeled anomaly samples, limiting the model from learning discriminative characteristics of true anomalies. Therefore, these approaches often struggle to distinguish anomalies from normal instances, resulting in reduced detection and weak localization performance. In real-world applications, where training data are frequently contaminated with anomalies, such methods fail to deliver reliable performance. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates limited anomaly supervision into the adaptive deviation learning paradigm. We introduce a composite anomaly score that combines three complementary components: a deviation score capturing statistical irregularity, an entropy-based uncertainty score reflecting predictive inconsistency, and a segmentation-based score highlighting spatial abnormality. This unified scoring mechanism enables accurate detection and supports gradient-based localization, providing intuitive and explainable visual evidence of anomalous regions. Following the few-anomaly paradigm, we incorporate a small set of labeled anomalies during training while simultaneously mitigating the influence of contaminated samples through adaptive instance weighting. Extensive experiments on the MVTec and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves strong detection and localization performance, interpretability, and robustness under various levels of data contamination.

- **Summary**: The estimation of abundance and density in unmarked populations of great apes relies on statistical frameworks that require animal-to-camera distance measurements. In practice, acquiring these distances depends on labour-intensive manual interpretation of animal observations across large camera trap video corpora. This study introduces and evaluates an only sparsely explored alternative: the integration of computer vision-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) pipelines directly into ecological camera trap workflows for great ape conservation. Using a real-world dataset of 220 camera trap videos documenting a wild chimpanzee population, we combine two MDE models, Dense Prediction Transformers and Depth Anything, with multiple distance sampling strategies. These components are used to generate detection distance estimates, from which population density and abundance are inferred. Comparative analysis against manually derived ground-truth distances shows that calibrated DPT consistently outperforms Depth Anything. This advantage is observed in both distance estimation accuracy and downstream density and abundance inference. Nevertheless, both models exhibit systematic biases. We show that, given complex forest environments, they tend to overestimate detection distances and consequently underestimate density and abundance relative to conventional manual approaches. We further find that failures in animal detection across distance ranges are a primary factor limiting estimation accuracy. Overall, this work provides a case study that shows MDE-driven camera trap distance sampling is a viable and practical alternative to manual distance estimation. The proposed approach yields population estimates within 22% of those obtained using traditional methods.

- **Summary**: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) predicts perceptual quality scores consistent with human judgments. Recent RL-based IQA methods built on MLLMs focus on generating visual quality descriptions and scores, ignoring two key reliability limitations: (i) although the model's prediction stability varies significantly across training samples, existing GRPO-based methods apply uniform advantage weighting, thereby amplifying noisy signals from unstable samples in gradient updates; (ii) most works emphasize text-grounded reasoning over images while overlooking the model's visual perception ability of image content. In this paper, we propose Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based reliable visual policy optimization framework that redesigns the learning signal through unified Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization. Q-Hawkeye estimates predictive uncertainty using the variance of predicted scores across multiple rollouts and leverages this uncertainty to reweight each sample's update strength, stabilizing policy optimization. To strengthen perceptual reliability, we construct paired inputs of degraded images and their original images and introduce an Implicit Perception Loss that constrains the model to ground its quality judgments in genuine visual evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Hawkeye outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes better across multiple datasets. The code and models will be made available.

- **Summary**: Image embeddings are generally assumed to pose limited privacy risk. We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks often exhibit substantial disparities in class-wise accuracy, even when trained on class-balanced data, posing concerns for reliable deployment. While prior efforts have explored empirical remedies, a theoretical understanding of such performance disparities in classification remains limited. In this work, we present Margin Regularization for Performance Disparity Reduction (MR$^2$), a theoretically principled regularization for classification by dynamically adjusting margins in both the logit and representation spaces. Our analysis establishes a margin-based, class-sensitive generalization bound that reveals how per-class feature variability contributes to error, motivating the use of larger margins for hard classes. Guided by this insight, MR$^2$ optimizes per-class logit margins proportional to feature spread and penalizes excessive representation margins to enhance intra-class compactness. Experiments on seven datasets, including ImageNet, and diverse pre-trained backbones (MAE, MoCov2, CLIP) demonstrate that MR$^2$ not only improves overall accuracy but also significantly boosts hard class performance without trading off easy classes, thus reducing performance disparity.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face significant computational challenges in video processing due to massive data redundancy, which creates prohibitively long token sequences. To address this, we introduce Triage, a training-free, plug-and-play framework that reframes video reasoning as a resource allocation problem via hierarchical visual budgeting. Its first stage, Frame-Level Budgeting, identifies keyframes by evaluating their visual dynamics and relevance, generating a strategic prior based on their importance scores. Guided by this prior, the second stage, Token-Level Budgeting, allocates tokens in two phases: it first secures high-relevance Core Tokens, followed by diverse Context Tokens selected with an efficient batched Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Triage improves inference speed and reduces memory footprint, while maintaining or surpassing the performance of baselines and other methods on various video reasoning benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Supervised machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in optical quality control within industrial production. These approaches require representative datasets for effective model training. However, while non-defective components are frequent, defective parts are rare in production, resulting in highly imbalanced datasets that adversely impact model performance. Existing strategies to address this challenge, such as specialized loss functions or traditional data augmentation techniques, have limitations, including the need for careful hyperparameter tuning or the alteration of only simple image features. Therefore, this work explores the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) as an alternative method for expanding limited datasets and enhancing supervised machine learning performance. Specifically, we investigate Stable Diffusion and CycleGAN as image generation models, focusing on the segmentation of combine harvester components in thermal images for subsequent defect detection. Our results demonstrate that dataset expansion using Stable Diffusion yields the most significant improvement, enhancing segmentation performance by 4.6 %, resulting in a Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU) of 84.6 %.

- **Summary**: Factory automation has become increasingly important due to labor shortages, leading to the introduction of autonomous mobile robots for tasks such as material transportation. Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus. Automatic annotation also reduces human effort and ensures consistent labeling quality. Future work will investigate the relationship between confidence thresholds and recognition performance.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D fetal MR volumes from motion-corrupted stacks of 2D slices is a crucial and challenging task. Conventional slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods are time-consuming and require multiple orthogonal stacks for reconstruction. While learning-based SVR approaches have significantly reduced the time required at the inference stage, they heavily rely on ground truth information for training, which is inaccessible in practice. To address these challenges, we propose GaussianSVR, a self-supervised framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. GaussianSVR represents the target volume using 3D Gaussian representations to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. It leverages a simulated forward slice acquisition model to enable self-supervised training, alleviating the need for ground-truth volumes. Furthermore, to enhance both accuracy and efficiency, we introduce a multi-resolution training strategy that jointly optimizes Gaussian parameters and spatial transformations across different resolution levels. Experiments show that GaussianSVR outperforms the baseline methods on fetal MR volumetric reconstruction. Code will be available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based object detectors have achieved impressive performance in microscopy imaging, yet their confidence estimates often lack calibration, limiting their reliability for biomedical applications. In this work, we introduce a new approach to improve model calibration by leveraging multi-rater annotations. We propose to train separate models on the annotations from single experts and aggregate their predictions to emulate consensus. This improves upon label sampling strategies, where models are trained on mixed annotations, and offers a more principled way to capture inter-rater variability. Experiments on a colorectal organoid dataset annotated by two experts demonstrate that our rater-specific ensemble strategy improves calibration performance while maintaining comparable detection accuracy. These findings suggest that explicitly modelling rater disagreement can lead to more trustworthy object detectors in biomedical imaging.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised deformable image registration requires aligning complex anatomical structures without reference labels, making interpretability and reliability critical. Existing deep learning methods achieve considerable accuracy but often lack transparency, leading to error drift and reduced clinical trust. We propose a novel Multi-Hop Visual Chain of Reasoning (VCoR) framework that reformulates registration as a progressive reasoning process. Inspired by the iterative nature of clinical decision-making, each visual reasoning hop integrates a Localized Spatial Refinement (LSR) module to enrich feature representations and a Cross-Reference Attention (CRA) mechanism that leads the iterative refinement process, preserving anatomical consistency. This multi-hop strategy enables robust handling of large deformations and produces a transparent sequence of intermediate predictions with a theoretical bound. Beyond accuracy, our framework offers built-in interpretability by estimating uncertainty via the stability and convergence of deformation fields across hops. Extensive evaluations on two challenging public datasets, DIR-Lab 4D CT (lung) and IXI T1-weighted MRI (brain), demonstrate that VCoR achieves competitive registration accuracy while offering rich intermediate visualizations and confidence measures. By embedding an implicit visual reasoning paradigm, we present an interpretable, reliable, and clinically viable unsupervised medical image registration.

- **Summary**: Modulo imaging enables high dynamic range (HDR) acquisition by cyclically wrapping saturated intensities, but accurate reconstruction remains challenging due to ambiguities between natural image edges and artificial wrap discontinuities. This work proposes a learning-based HDR restoration framework that incorporates two key strategies: (i) a scale-equivariant regularization that enforces consistency under exposure variations, and (ii) a feature lifting input design combining the raw modulo image, wrapped finite differences, and a closed-form initialization. Together, these components enhance the network's ability to distinguish true structure from wrapping artifacts, yielding state-of-the-art performance across perceptual and linear HDR quality metrics.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but still suffer from hallucination and safety-related failures that persist even at scale. Steering offers a lightweight technique to improve model performance. However, steering, whether input-dependent or input-independent, achieves a meaningful trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we observe that steering vectors can generalize across inputs when tasks share aligned semantic intent. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{OSGA} (\textbf{O}ne-shot \textbf{S}teering with \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}nchor), an input-independent framework that improves model performance with a single optimization instance. OSGA first selects an informative sample via a variance-based data selection strategy and learns a single steering vector with a contrastive objective with generative anchor regularization. The resulting vector can be universally applied at a certain layer during inference time without modifying model parameters. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that a single OSGA-optimized steering vector consistently improves hallucination mitigation and safety enhancement with negligible overhead, highlighting one-shot steering as a practical and scalable solution for reliable VLMs.

- **Summary**: Visual geolocalization, the task of predicting where an image was taken, remains challenging due to global scale, visual ambiguity, and the inherently hierarchical structure of geography. Existing paradigms rely on either large-scale retrieval, which requires storing a large number of image embeddings, grid-based classifiers that ignore geographic continuity, or generative models that diffuse over space but struggle with fine detail. We introduce an entity-centric formulation of geolocation that replaces image-to-image retrieval with a compact hierarchy of geographic entities embedded in Hyperbolic space. Images are aligned directly to country, region, subregion, and city entities through Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning by directly incorporating haversine distance into the contrastive objective. This hierarchical design enables interpretable predictions and efficient inference with 240k entity embeddings instead of over 5 million image embeddings on the OSV5M benchmark, on which our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the current methods in the literature, it reduces mean geodesic error by 19.5\%, while improving the fine-grained subregion accuracy by 43%. These results demonstrate that geometry-aware hierarchical embeddings provide a scalable and conceptually new alternative for global image geolocation.

- **Summary**: Recent reconstruction methods based on radiance field such as NeRF and 3DGS reproduce indoor scenes with high visual fidelity, but break down under scene editing due to baked illumination and the lack of explicit light transport. In contrast, physically based inverse rendering relies on mesh representations and path tracing, which enforce correct light transport but place strong requirements on geometric fidelity, becoming a practical bottleneck for real indoor scenes. In this work, we propose Emission-Aware Gaussians and Path Tracing (EAG-PT), aiming for physically based light transport with a unified 2D Gaussian representation. Our design is based on three cores: (1) using 2D Gaussians as a unified scene representation and transport-friendly geometry proxy that avoids reconstructed mesh, (2) explicitly separating emissive and non-emissive components during reconstruction for further scene editing, and (3) decoupling reconstruction from final rendering by using efficient single-bounce optimization and high-quality multi-bounce path tracing after scene editing. Experiments on synthetic and real indoor scenes show that EAG-PT produces more natural and physically consistent renders after editing than radiant scene reconstructions, while preserving finer geometric detail and avoiding mesh-induced artifacts compared to mesh-based inverse path tracing. These results suggest promising directions for future use in interior design, XR content creation, and embodied AI.

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers in men worldwide. Bi-parametric MRI (bp-MRI) and clinical variables are crucial for PCa identification and improving treatment decisions. However, this process is subjective to expert interpretations. Furthermore, most existing computer-aided diagnosis methods focus on imaging-based models, overlooking the clinical context and suffering from data scarcity, limiting their ability to learn robust representations. We propose a geometric multimodal Foundation Model (FM), named MFM-Geom, that learns representations from bp-MRI and clinical reports, encoding visual findings and information from the context of clinical variables. In the representations classification head, the approach leverages symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices and Riemannian deep learning to integrate imaging-text representations from a biomedical multimodal FM. Using 10% of the training data, MFM-Geom outperformed baseline class token embedding-based classification (+8.3%, AUC-PR of 90.67). Generalization on external dataset confirmed the robustness of fine-tuning biomedical FM, achieving an AUC-PR of 90.6.

- **Summary**: This work focuses on assessing the information-theoretic limits of scene parameter estimation in plenoptic imaging systems. A general framework to compute lower bounds on the parameter estimation error from noisy plenoptic observations is presented, with a particular focus on passive indirect imaging problems, where the observations do not contain line-of-sight information about the parameter(s) of interest. Using computer graphics rendering software to synthesize the often-complicated dependence among parameter(s) of interest and observations, i.e. the forward model, the proposed framework evaluates the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound to establish lower bounds on the variance of any unbiased estimator of the unknown parameters. The effects of inexact rendering of the true forward model on the computed lower bounds are also analyzed, both theoretically and via simulations. Experimental evaluations compare the computed lower bounds with the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator on a canonical object localization problem, showing that the lower bounds computed via the framework proposed here are indicative of the true underlying fundamental limits in several nominally representative scenarios.

- **Summary**: Transferable adversarial attacks on point clouds remain challenging, as existing methods often rely on model-specific gradients or heuristics that limit generalization to unseen architectures. In this paper, we rethink adversarial transferability from a compact subspace perspective and propose CoSA, a transferable attack framework that operates within a shared low-dimensional semantic space. Specifically, each point cloud is represented as a compact combination of class-specific prototypes that capture shared semantic structure, while adversarial perturbations are optimized within a low-rank subspace to induce coherent and architecture-agnostic variations. This design suppresses model-dependent noise and constrains perturbations to semantically meaningful directions, thereby improving cross-model transferability without relying on surrogate-specific artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and network architectures demonstrate that CoSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transferable attacks, while maintaining competitive imperceptibility and robustness under common defense strategies. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

- **Summary**: We propose VL-DUN, a principled framework for joint All-in-One Medical Image Restoration and Segmentation (AiOMIRS) that bridges the gap between low-level signal recovery and high-level semantic understanding. While standard pipelines treat these tasks in isolation, our core insight is that they are fundamentally synergistic: restoration provides clean anatomical structures to improve segmentation, while semantic priors regularize the restoration process. VL-DUN resolves the sub-optimality of sequential processing through two primary innovations. (1) We formulate AiOMIRS as a unified optimization problem, deriving an interpretable joint unfolding mechanism where restoration and segmentation are mathematically coupled for mutual refinement. (2) We introduce a frequency-aware Mamba mechanism to capture long-range dependencies for global segmentation while preserving the high-frequency textures necessary for restoration. This allows for efficient global context modeling with linear complexity, effectively mitigating the spectral bias of standard architectures. As a pioneering work in the AiOMIRS task, VL-DUN establishes a new state-of-the-art across multi-modal benchmarks, improving PSNR by 0.92 dB and the Dice coefficient by 9.76\%. Our results demonstrate that joint collaborative learning offers a superior, more robust solution for complex clinical workflows compared to isolated task processing.

- **Summary**: Accurate sensor-to-vehicle calibration is essential for safe autonomous driving. Angular misalignments of LiDAR sensors can lead to safety-critical issues during autonomous operation. However, current methods primarily focus on correcting sensor-to-sensor errors without considering the miscalibration of individual sensors that cause these errors in the first place. We introduce FlowCalib, the first framework that detects LiDAR-to-vehicle miscalibration using motion cues from the scene flow of static objects. Our approach leverages the systematic bias induced by rotational misalignment in the flow field generated from sequential 3D point clouds, eliminating the need for additional sensors. The architecture integrates a neural scene flow prior for flow estimation and incorporates a dual-branch detection network that fuses learned global flow features with handcrafted geometric descriptors. These combined representations allow the system to perform two complementary binary classification tasks: a global binary decision indicating whether misalignment is present and separate, axis-specific binary decisions indicating whether each rotational axis is misaligned. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate FlowCalib's ability to robustly detect miscalibration, establishing a benchmark for sensor-to-vehicle miscalibration detection.

- **Summary**: Smallholder cacao producers often rely on outdated farming techniques and face significant challenges from pests and diseases, unlike larger plantations with more resources and expertise. In the Philippines, cacao farmers have limited access to data, information, and good agricultural practices. This study addresses these issues by developing a mobile application for cacao disease identification and management that functions offline, enabling use in remote areas where farms are mostly located. The core of the system is a deep learning model trained to identify cacao diseases accurately. The trained model is integrated into the mobile app to support farmers in field diagnosis. The disease identification model achieved a validation accuracy of 96.93% while the model for detecting cacao black pod infection levels achieved 79.49% validation accuracy. Field testing of the application showed an agreement rate of 84.2% compared with expert cacao technician assessments. This approach empowers smallholder farmers by providing accessible, technology-enabled tools to improve cacao crop health and productivity.

- **Summary**: Scene understanding with free-form language has been widely explored within diverse modalities such as images, point clouds, and LiDAR. However, related studies on event sensors are scarce or narrowly centered on semantic-level understanding. We introduce SEAL, the first Semantic-aware Segment Any Events framework that addresses Open-Vocabulary Event Instance Segmentation (OV-EIS). Given the visual prompt, our model presents a unified framework to support both event segmentation and open-vocabulary mask classification at multiple levels of granularity, including instance-level and part-level. To enable thorough evaluation on OV-EIS, we curate four benchmarks that cover label granularity from coarse to fine class configurations and semantic granularity from instance-level to part-level understanding. Extensive experiments show that our SEAL largely outperforms proposed baselines in terms of performance and inference speed with a parameter-efficient architecture. In the Appendix, we further present a simple variant of our SEAL achieving generic spatiotemporal OV-EIS that does not require any visual prompts from users in the inference.

- **Summary**: Video relighting offers immense creative potential and commercial value but is hindered by challenges, including the absence of an adequate evaluation metric, severe light flickering, and the degradation of fine-grained details during editing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hi-Light, a novel, training-free framework for high-fidelity, high-resolution, robust video relighting. Our approach introduces three technical innovations: lightness prior anchored guided relighting diffusion that stabilises intermediate relit video, a Hybrid Motion-Adaptive Lighting Smoothing Filter that leverages optical flow to ensure temporal stability without introducing motion blur, and a LAB-based Detail Fusion module that preserves high-frequency detail information from the original video. Furthermore, to address the critical gap in evaluation, we propose the Light Stability Score, the first quantitative metric designed to specifically measure lighting consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-Light significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, producing stable, highly detailed relit videos.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a hybrid two-stage registration framework for reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) kidney anatomy from macroscopic slices, using CT-derived models as the geometric reference standard. The approach addresses the data-scarcity and high-distortion challenges typical of macroscopic imaging, where fully learning-based registration (e.g., VoxelMorph) often fails to generalize due to limited training diversity and large nonrigid deformations that exceed the capture range of unconstrained convolutional filters. In the proposed pipeline, the Optimal Cross-section Matching (OCM) algorithm first performs constrained global alignment: translation, rotation, and uniform scaling to establish anatomically consistent slice initialization. Next, a lightweight deep-learning refinement network, inspired by VoxelMorph, predicts residual local deformations between consecutive slices. The core novelty of this architecture lies in its hierarchical decomposition of the registration manifold. This hybrid OCM+DL design integrates explicit geometric priors with the flexible learning capacity of neural networks, ensuring stable optimization and plausible deformation fields even with few training examples. Experiments on an original dataset of 40 kidneys demonstrated better results compared to single-stage baselines. The pipeline maintains physical calibration via Hough-based grid detection and employs Bezier-based contour smoothing for robust meshing and volume estimation. Although validated on kidney data, the proposed framework generalizes to other soft-tissue organs reconstructed from optical or photographic cross-sections. By decoupling interpretable global optimization from data-efficient deep refinement, the method advances the precision, reproducibility, and anatomical realism of multimodal 3D reconstructions for surgical planning, morphological assessment, and medical education.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have been increasingly used as strong generative priors for solving inverse problems such as super-resolution in medical imaging. However, these approaches typically utilize a diffusion prior trained at a single scale, ignoring the hierarchical scale structure of image data. In this work, we propose to decompose images into Laplacian pyramid scales and train separate diffusion priors for each frequency band. We then develop an algorithm to perform super-resolution that utilizes these priors to progressively refine reconstructions across different scales. Evaluated on brain, knee, and prostate MRI data, our approach both improves perceptual quality over baselines and reduces inference time through smaller coarse-scale networks. Our framework unifies multiscale reconstruction and diffusion priors for medical image super-resolution.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial imaging modality for viewing internal body structures. This research work analyses the performance of popular GAN models for accurate and precise MRI reconstruction by enhancing image quality and improving diagnostic accuracy. Three GAN architectures considered in this study are Vanilla GAN, Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). They were trained and evaluated using knee, brain, and cardiac MRI datasets to assess their generalizability across body regions. While the Vanilla GAN operates on the fundamentals of the adversarial network setup, DCGAN advances image synthesis by securing the convolutional layers, giving a superior appearance to the prevalent spatial features. Training instability is resolved in WGAN through the Wasserstein distance to minimize an unstable regime, therefore, ensuring stable convergence and high-quality images. The GAN models were trained and tested using 1000 MR images of an anonymized knee, 805 images of Heart, 90 images of Brain MRI dataset. The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for Vanilla GAN is 0.84, DCGAN is 0.97, and WGAN is 0.99. The Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) for Vanilla GAN is 26, DCGAN is 49.3, and WGAN is 43.5. The results were further statistically validated. This study shows that DCGAN and WGAN-based frameworks are promising in MR image reconstruction because of good image quality and superior accuracy. With the first cross-organ benchmark of baseline GANs under a common preprocessing pipeline, this work provides a reproducible benchmark for future hybrid GANs and clinical MRI applications.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language instructions in partially observed 3D environments, motivating map representations that aggregate spatial context beyond local perception. However, most existing approaches rely on hand-crafted maps constructed independently of the navigation policy. We argue that maps should instead be learned representations shaped directly by navigation objectives rather than exhaustive reconstructions. Based on this insight, we propose MapDream, a map-in-the-loop framework that formulates map construction as autoregressive bird's-eye-view (BEV) image synthesis. The framework jointly learns map generation and action prediction, distilling environmental context into a compact three-channel BEV map that preserves only navigation-critical affordances. Supervised pre-training bootstraps a reliable mapping-to-control interface, while the autoregressive design enables end-to-end joint optimization through reinforcement fine-tuning. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE achieve state-of-the-art monocular performance, validating task-driven generative map learning.

- **Summary**: Despite recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)' linguistic prowess in medical diagnosis, we find even state-of-the-art MLLMs suffer from a critical perceptual deficit: geometric blindness. This failure to ground outputs in objective geometric constraints leads to plausible yet factually incorrect hallucinations, rooted in training paradigms that prioritize linguistic fluency over geometric fidelity. This paper introduces Med-Scout, a novel framework that "cures" this blindness via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that leverages the intrinsic geometric logic latent within unlabeled medical images. Instead of relying on costly expert annotations, Med-Scout derives verifiable supervision signals through three strategic proxy tasks: Hierarchical Scale Localization, Topological Jigsaw Reconstruction, and Anomaly Consistency Detection. To rigorously quantify this deficit, we present Med-Scout-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate geometric perception. Extensive evaluations show that Med-Scout significantly mitigates geometric blindness, outperforming leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs by over 40% on our benchmark. Furthermore, this enhanced geometric perception generalizes to broader medical understanding, achieving superior results on radiological and comprehensive medical VQA tasks.

- **Summary**: While dense pixel-wise annotations remain the gold standard for medical image segmentation, they are costly to obtain and limit scalability. In contrast, many deployed systems already produce inexpensive automatic quality-control (QC) signals like model agreement, uncertainty measures, or learned mask-quality scores which can be used for further model training without additional ground-truth annotation. However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability. Across two medical datasets and multiple regimes, RN-DPO improves sustained performance and stabilizes preference-based fine-tuning, outperforming standard DPO and strong baselines without requiring additional pixel annotations.

- **Summary**: Existing multimodal large language models for long-video understanding predominantly rely on uniform sampling and single-turn inference, limiting their ability to identify sparse yet critical evidence amid extensive redundancy. We introduce Video-o3, a novel framework that supports iterative discovery of salient visual clues, fine-grained inspection of key segments, and adaptive termination once sufficient evidence is acquired. Technically, we address two core challenges in interleaved tool invocation. First, to mitigate attention dispersion induced by the heterogeneity of reasoning and tool-calling, we propose Task-Decoupled Attention Masking, which isolates per-step concentration while preserving shared global context. Second, to control context length growth in multi-turn interactions, we introduce a Verifiable Trajectory-Guided Reward that balances exploration coverage with reasoning efficiency. To support training at scale, we further develop a data synthesis pipeline and construct Seeker-173K, comprising 173K high-quality tool-interaction trajectories for effective supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments show that Video-o3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes. These results demonstrate Video-o3's strong multi-hop evidence-seeking and reasoning capabilities, and validate the effectiveness of native tool invocation in long-video scenarios.

- **Summary**: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in information retrieval, yet existing research has mainly focused on text or static multimodal settings. Open-domain video shot retrieval, which involves richer temporal structure and more complex semantics, still lacks systematic benchmarks and analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce ShotFinder, a benchmark that formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions and introduces five types of controllable single-factor constraints: Temporal order, Color, Visual style, Audio, and Resolution. We curate 1,210 high-quality samples from YouTube across 20 thematic categories, using large models for generation with human verification. Based on the benchmark, we propose ShotFinder, a text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline: (1) query expansion via video imagination, (2) candidate video retrieval with a search engine, and (3) description-guided temporal localization. Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges. These results reveal that open-domain video shot retrieval is still a critical capability that multimodal large models have yet to overcome.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on standard video understanding benchmarks yet fail systematically on simple reasoning tasks that preschool children can solve, including counting, spatial reasoning, and compositional understanding. We hypothesize that the pedagogically-structured content of educational videos provides an ideal training signal for improving these capabilities. We introduce DoraVQA, a dataset of 5,344 question-answer pairs automatically extracted from 8 seasons of Dora the Explorer with precise timestamp alignment. Each episode follows a consistent \textit{context-question-pause-answer} structure that creates a self-contained learning environment analogous to interactive tutoring. We fine-tune both Qwen2 and Qwen3 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leveraging the clear correctness signals and structured reasoning traces inherent in educational content. Despite training exclusively on 38 hours of children's educational videos, our approach achieves improvements of 8-14 points on DoraVQA and state-of-the-art 86.16\% on CVBench, with strong transfer to Video-MME and NExT-QA, demonstrating effective generalization from narrow pedagogical content to broad multimodal understanding. Through cross-domain benchmarks, we show that VLMs can perform tasks that require robust reasoning learned from structured educational content, suggesting that content structure matters as much as content scale.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models suffer performance degradation under domain shift, limiting real-world applicability. Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues. Combined with dynamic clustering and pseudo-label refinement, it effectively recalibrates the model for novel visual contexts. Experiments across diverse datasets show that TaTa significantly reduces computational cost while achieving state-of-the-art performance in domain and cross-dataset generalization.

- **Summary**: Despite rapid advances in autonomous AI scientists powered by language models, generating publication-ready illustrations remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in the research workflow. To lift this burden, we introduce PaperBanana, an agentic framework for automated generation of publication-ready academic illustrations. Powered by state-of-the-art VLMs and image generation models, PaperBanana orchestrates specialized agents to retrieve references, plan content and style, render images, and iteratively refine via self-critique. To rigorously evaluate our framework, we introduce PaperBananaBench, comprising 292 test cases for methodology diagrams curated from NeurIPS 2025 publications, covering diverse research domains and illustration styles. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PaperBanana consistently outperforms leading baselines in faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and aesthetics. We further show that our method effectively extends to the generation of high-quality statistical plots. Collectively, PaperBanana paves the way for the automated generation of publication-ready illustrations.

- **Summary**: Astronomical imaging remains noise-limited under practical observing constraints, while standard calibration pipelines mainly remove structured artifacts and leave stochastic noise largely unresolved. Learning-based denoising is promising, yet progress is hindered by scarce paired training data and the need for physically interpretable and reproducible models in scientific workflows. We propose a physics-based noise synthesis framework tailored to CCD noise formation. The pipeline models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and localized outliers arising from cosmic-ray hits and hot pixels. To obtain low-noise inputs for synthesis, we average multiple unregistered exposures to produce high-SNR bases. Realistic noisy counterparts synthesized from these bases using our noise model enable the construction of abundant paired datasets for supervised learning. We further introduce a real-world dataset across multi-bands acquired with two twin ground-based telescopes, providing paired raw frames and instrument-pipeline calibrated frames, together with calibration data and stacked high-SNR bases for real-world evaluation.

- **Summary**: Open-set object detection (OSOD) localizes objects while identifying and rejecting unknown classes at inference. While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence. Based on the findings, we propose several prompting strategies and prompt enhancement methods for OSOD models in XR environments.

- **Summary**: While recent video diffusion models (VDMs) produce visually impressive results, they fundamentally struggle to maintain 3D structural consistency, often resulting in object deformation or spatial drift. We hypothesize that these failures arise because standard denoising objectives lack explicit incentives for geometric coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoGPA (Video Geometric Preference Alignment), a data-efficient self-supervised framework that leverages a geometry foundation model to automatically derive dense preference signals that guide VDMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This approach effectively steers the generative distribution toward inherent 3D consistency without requiring human annotations. VideoGPA significantly enhances temporal stability, physical plausibility, and motion coherence using minimal preference pairs, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in extensive experiments.

- **Summary**: Efficient inference in Large Vision-Language Models is constrained by the high cost of processing thousands of visual tokens, yet it remains unclear which tokens and computations can be safely removed. While attention scores are commonly used to estimate visual token importance, they are an imperfect proxy for actual contribution. We show that Attention Contribution, which weights attention probabilities by value vector magnitude, provides a more accurate criterion for visual token selection. Our empirical analysis reveals that visual attention sinks are functionally heterogeneous, comprising Probability Dumps with low contribution that can be safely pruned, and Structural Anchors with high contribution essential for maintaining model performance. Further, we identify substantial redundancy in Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) associated with visual tokens, particularly in intermediate layers where image tokens exhibit linear behavior. Based on our findings, we introduce CAPA (Contribution-Aware Pruning and FFN Approximation), a dual-strategy framework that prunes visual tokens using attention contribution at critical functional transitions and reduces FFN computation through efficient linear approximations. Experiments on various benchmarks across baselines show that CAPA achieves competent efficiency--performance trade-offs with improved robustness.

- **Summary**: The rapid progress of text-to-image (T2I) models has unlocked unprecedented creative potential, yet their ability to faithfully render complex prompts involving multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relationships remains a significant bottleneck. Progress is hampered by a lack of adequate evaluation methods; current benchmarks are often restricted to closed-set vocabularies, lack fine-grained diagnostic capabilities, and fail to provide the interpretable feedback necessary to diagnose and remedy specific compositional failures. We solve these challenges by introducing SANEval (Spatial, Attribute, and Numeracy Evaluation), a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a scalable new pipeline for open-vocabulary compositional evaluation. SANEval combines a large language model (LLM) for deep prompt understanding with an LLM-enhanced, open-vocabulary object detector to robustly evaluate compositional adherence, unconstrained by a fixed vocabulary. Through extensive experiments on six state-of-the-art T2I models, we demonstrate that SANEval's automated evaluations provide a more faithful proxy for human assessment; our metric achieves a Spearman's rank correlation with statistically different results than those of existing benchmarks across tasks of attribute binding, spatial relations, and numeracy. To facilitate future research in compositional T2I generation and evaluation, we will release the SANEval dataset and our open-source evaluation pipeline.

- **Summary**: Subspace clustering aims to group data points that lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces and finds wide application in computer vision, hyperspectral imaging, and recommendation systems. However, most existing methods assume fully observed data, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with missing entries. In this paper, we propose a contrastive self-supervised framework, Contrastive Subspace Clustering (CSC), designed for clustering incomplete data. CSC generates masked views of partially observed inputs and trains a deep neural network using a SimCLR-style contrastive loss to learn invariant embeddings. These embeddings are then clustered using sparse subspace clustering. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that CSC consistently outperforms both classical and deep learning baselines, demonstrating strong robustness to missing data and scalability to large datasets.

- **Summary**: Being able to edit panoramic images is crucial for creating realistic 360° visual experiences. However, existing perspective-based image editing methods fail to model the spatial structure of panoramas. Conventional cube-map decompositions attempt to overcome this problem but inevitably break global consistency due to their mismatch with spherical geometry. Motivated by this insight, we reformulate panoramic editing directly in the equirectangular projection (ERP) domain and present World-Shaper, a unified geometry-aware framework that bridges panoramic generation and editing within a single editing-centric design. To overcome the scarcity of paired data, we adopt a generate-then-edit paradigm, where controllable panoramic generation serves as an auxiliary stage to synthesize diverse paired examples for supervised editing learning. To address geometric distortion, we introduce a geometry-aware learning strategy that explicitly enforces position-aware shape supervision and implicitly internalizes panoramic priors through progressive training. Extensive experiments on our new benchmark, PEBench, demonstrate that our method achieves superior geometric consistency, editing fidelity, and text controllability compared to SOTA methods, enabling coherent and flexible 360° visual world creation with unified editing control. Code, model, and data will be released at our project page: https://world-shaper-project.github.io/

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved photorealistic image synthesis, yet they fall short for studio-level multi-object compositing. This task demands simultaneous (i) near-perfect preservation of each item's identity, (ii) precise background and color fidelity, (iii) layout and design elements control, and (iv) complete, appealing displays showcasing all objects. However, current state-of-the-art models often alter object details, omit or duplicate objects, and produce layouts with incorrect relative sizing or inconsistent item presentations. To bridge this gap, we introduce PLACID, a framework that transforms a collection of object images into an appealing multi-object composite. Our approach makes two main contributions. First, we leverage a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) diffusion model with text control to preserve objects consistency, identities, and background details by exploiting temporal priors from videos. Second, we propose a novel data curation strategy that generates synthetic sequences where randomly placed objects smoothly move to their target positions. This synthetic data aligns with the video model's temporal priors during training. At inference, objects initialized at random positions consistently converge into coherent layouts guided by text, with the final frame serving as the composite image. Extensive quantitative evaluations and user studies demonstrate that PLACID surpasses state-of-the-art methods in multi-object compositing, achieving superior identity, background, and color preservation, with less omitted objects and visually appealing results.

- **Summary**: Auto-regressive video generation enables long video synthesis by iteratively conditioning each new batch of frames on previously generated content. However, recent work has shown that such pipelines suffer from severe temporal drift, where errors accumulate and amplify over long horizons. We hypothesize that this drift does not primarily stem from insufficient model capacity, but rather from inference-time error propagation. Specifically, we contend that drift arises from the uncontrolled reuse of corrupted latent conditioning tokens during auto-regressive inference. To correct this accumulation of errors, we propose a simple, inference-time method that mitigates temporal drift by identifying and removing unstable latent tokens before they are reused for conditioning. For this purpose, we define unstable tokens as latent tokens whose representations deviate significantly from those of the previously generated batch, indicating potential corruption or semantic drift. By explicitly removing corrupted latent tokens from the auto-regressive context, rather than modifying entire spatial regions or model parameters, our method prevents unreliable latent information from influencing future generation steps. As a result, it significantly improves long-horizon temporal consistency without modifying the model architecture, training procedure, or leaving latent space.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding is essential for video reasoning and embodied AI. Yet, while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) master static semantics, their grasp of temporal dynamics remains brittle. We present TimeBlind, a diagnostic benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal understanding. Inspired by cognitive science, TimeBlind categorizes fine-grained temporal understanding into three levels: recognizing atomic events, characterizing event properties, and reasoning about event interdependencies. Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal reasoning, TimeBlind leverages a minimal-pairs paradigm: video pairs share identical static visual content but differ solely in temporal structure, utilizing complementary questions to neutralize language priors. Evaluating over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro) on 600 curated instances (2400 video-question pairs), reveals that the Instance Accuracy (correctly distinguishing both videos in a pair) of the best performing MLLM is only 48.2%, far below the human performance (98.2%). These results demonstrate that even frontier models rely heavily on static visual shortcuts rather than genuine temporal logic, positioning TimeBlind as a vital diagnostic tool for next-generation video understanding.

- **Summary**: This document presents an introduction to computer vision, and its relationship to Cognitive Science, from the perspective of Bayes Decision Theory (Berger 1985). Computer vision is a vast and complex field, so this overview has a narrow scope and provides a theoretical lens which captures many key concepts. BDT is rich enough to include two different approaches: (i) the Bayesian viewpoint, which gives a conceptually attractive framework for vision with concepts that resonate with Cognitive Science (Griffiths et al., 2024), and (ii) the Deep Neural Network approach whose successes in the real world have made Computer Vision into a trillion-dollar industry and which is motivated by the hierarchical structure of the visual ventral stream. The BDT framework relates and captures the strengths and weakness of these two approaches and, by discussing the limitations of BDT, points the way to how they can be combined in a richer framework.

- **Summary**: While sequential reasoning enhances the capability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to execute complex multimodal tasks, their reliability in grounding these reasoning chains within actual visual evidence remains insufficiently explored. We introduce LogicGaze, a novel benchmark framework designed to rigorously interrogate whether VLMs can validate sequential causal chains against visual inputs, specifically targeting the pervasive issue of hallucination. Curated from 40,000 video segments from ShareGPT4Video and a subset of Flickr30k imagery, LogicGaze integrates causal sequences with visually contradictory yet linguistically plausible perturbations, compelling models to verify the authenticity of each reasoning step. Our tripartite evaluation protocol - Causal Validation, Grounded Narrative Synthesis, and Perturbation Rejection - exposes significant vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B. LogicGaze advocates for robust, trustworthy multimodal reasoning, with all resources publicly available in an anonymized repository.

- **Summary**: The development of machine learning models for CT imaging depends on the availability of large, high-quality, and diverse annotated datasets. Although large volumes of CT images and reports are readily available in clinical picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), 3D segmentations of critical findings are costly to obtain, typically requiring extensive manual annotation by radiologists. On the other hand, it is common for radiologists to provide limited annotations of findings during routine reads, such as line measurements and arrows, that are often stored in PACS as GSPS objects. We posit that these sparse annotations can be extracted along with CT volumes and converted into 3D segmentations using promptable segmentation models, a paradigm we term Opportunistic Promptable Segmentation. To enable this paradigm, we propose SAM2CT, the first promptable segmentation model designed to convert radiologist annotations into 3D segmentations in CT volumes. SAM2CT builds upon SAM2 by extending the prompt encoder to support arrow and line inputs and by introducing Memory-Conditioned Memories (MCM), a memory encoding strategy tailored to 3D medical volumes. On public lesion segmentation benchmarks, SAM2CT outperforms existing promptable segmentation models and similarly trained baselines, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of 0.649 for arrow prompts and 0.757 for line prompts. Applying the model to pre-existing GSPS annotations from a clinical PACS (N = 60), SAM2CT generates 3D segmentations that are clinically acceptable or require only minor adjustments in 87% of cases, as scored by radiologists. Additionally, SAM2CT demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on select Emergency Department findings. These results suggest that large-scale mining of historical GSPS annotations represents a promising and scalable approach for generating 3D CT segmentation datasets.

- **Summary**: The viability of automated driving is heavily dependent on the performance of perception systems to provide real-time accurate and reliable information for robust decision-making and maneuvers. These systems must perform reliably not only under ideal conditions, but also when challenged by natural and adversarial driving factors. Both of these types of interference can lead to perception errors and delays in detection and classification. Hence, it is essential to assess the robustness of the perception systems of automated vehicles (AVs) and explore strategies for making perception more reliable. We approach this problem by evaluating perception performance using predictive sensitivity quantification based on an ensemble of models, capturing model disagreement and inference variability across multiple models, under adverse driving scenarios in both simulated environments and real-world conditions. A notional architecture for assessing perception performance is proposed. A perception assessment criterion is developed based on an AV's stopping distance at a stop sign on varying road surfaces, such as dry and wet asphalt, and vehicle speed. Five state-of-the-art computer vision models are used, including YOLO (v8-v9), DEtection TRansformer (DETR50, DETR101), Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR)in our experiments. Diminished lighting conditions, e.g., resulting from the presence of fog and low sun altitude, have the greatest impact on the performance of the perception models. Additionally, adversarial road conditions such as occlusions of roadway objects increase perception sensitivity and model performance drops when faced with a combination of adversarial road conditions and inclement weather conditions. Also, it is demonstrated that the greater the distance to a roadway object, the greater the impact on perception performance, hence diminished perception robustness.

- **Summary**: Synchronization over the special Euclidean group SE(3) aims to recover absolute poses from noisy pairwise relative transformations and is a core primitive in robotics and 3D vision. Standard approaches often require multi-step heuristic procedures to recover valid poses, which are difficult to analyze and typically lack theoretical guarantees. This paper adopts a dual quaternion representation and formulates SE(3) synchronization directly over the unit dual quaternion. A two-stage algorithm is developed: A spectral initializer computed via the power method on a Hermitian dual quaternion measurement matrix, followed by a dual quaternion generalized power method (DQGPM) that enforces feasibility through per-iteration projection. The estimation error bounds are established for spectral estimators, and DQGPM is shown to admit a finite-iteration error bound and achieves linear error contraction up to an explicit noise-dependent threshold. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world multi-scan point-set registration demonstrate that the proposed pipeline improves both accuracy and efficiency over representative matrix-based methods.

- **Summary**: This manuscript presents a pioneering Synergistic Neural Agents Network (SynerNet) framework designed to mitigate the phenomenon of cross-modal alignment degeneration in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) when encountering Out-of-Distribution (OOD) concepts. Specifically, four specialized computational units - visual perception, linguistic context, nominal embedding, and global coordination - collaboratively rectify modality disparities via a structured message-propagation protocol. The principal contributions encompass a multi-agent latent space nomenclature acquisition framework, a semantic context-interchange algorithm for enhanced few-shot adaptation, and an adaptive dynamic equilibrium mechanism. Empirical evaluations conducted on the VISTA-Beyond benchmark demonstrate that SynerNet yields substantial performance augmentations in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, exhibiting precision improvements ranging from 1.2% to 5.4% across a diverse array of domains.

- **Summary**: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the dominant paradigms for enhancing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on knowledge-based VQA tasks, recent work attributes RAG failures to insufficient attention towards the retrieved context, proposing to reduce the attention allocated to image tokens. In this work, we identify a distinct failure mode that previous study overlooked: Attention Distraction (AD). When the retrieved context is sufficient (highly relevant or including the correct answer), the retrieved text suppresses the visual attention globally, and the attention on image tokens shifts away from question-relevant regions. This leads to failures on questions the model could originally answer correctly without the retrieved text. To mitigate this issue, we propose MAD-RAG, a training-free intervention that decouples visual grounding from context integration through a dual-question formulation, combined with attention mixing to preserve image-conditioned evidence. Extensive experiments on OK-VQA, E-VQA, and InfoSeek demonstrate that MAD-RAG consistently outperforms existing baselines across different model families, yielding absolute gains of up to 4.76%, 9.20%, and 6.18% over the vanilla RAG baseline. Notably, MAD-RAG rectifies up to 74.68% of failure cases with negligible computational overhead.

- **Summary**: Multimodal fusion has emerged as a promising paradigm for disease diagnosis and prognosis, integrating complementary information from heterogeneous data sources such as medical images, clinical records, and radiology reports. However, existing fusion methods process all available modalities through the network, either treating them equally or learning to assign different contribution weights, leaving a fundamental question unaddressed: for a given patient, should certain modalities be used at all? We present AdaFuse, an adaptive multimodal fusion framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to learn patient-specific modality selection and fusion strategies for lung cancer risk prediction. AdaFuse formulates multimodal fusion as a sequential decision process, where the policy network iteratively decides whether to incorporate an additional modality or proceed to prediction based on the information already acquired. This sequential formulation enables the model to condition each selection on previously observed modalities and terminate early when sufficient information is available, rather than committing to a fixed subset upfront. We evaluate AdaFuse on the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaFuse achieves the highest AUC (0.762) compared to the best single-modality baseline (0.732), the best fixed fusion strategy (0.759), and adaptive baselines including DynMM (0.754) and MoE (0.742), while using fewer FLOPs than all triple-modality methods. Our work demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning for personalized multimodal fusion in medical imaging, representing a shift from uniform fusion strategies toward adaptive diagnostic pipelines that learn when to consult additional modalities and when existing information suffices for accurate prediction.

- **Summary**: Metal implants in MRI cause severe artifacts that degrade image quality and hinder clinical diagnosis. Traditional approaches address metal artifact reduction (MAR) and accelerated MRI acquisition as separate problems. We propose MASC, a unified reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes metal-aware k-space sampling and artifact correction for accelerated MRI. To enable supervised training, we construct a paired MRI dataset using physics-based simulation, generating k-space data and reconstructions for phantoms with and without metal implants. This paired dataset provides simulated 3D MRI scans with and without metal implants, where each metal-corrupted sample has an exactly matched clean reference, enabling direct supervision for both artifact reduction and acquisition policy learning. We formulate active MRI acquisition as a sequential decision-making problem, where an artifact-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent learns to select k-space phase-encoding lines under a limited acquisition budget. The agent operates on undersampled reconstructions processed through a U-Net-based MAR network, learning patterns that maximize reconstruction quality. We further propose an end-to-end training scheme where the acquisition policy learns to select k-space lines that best support artifact removal while the MAR network simultaneously adapts to the resulting undersampling patterns. Experiments demonstrate that MASC's learned policies outperform conventional sampling strategies, and end-to-end training improves performance compared to using a frozen pre-trained MAR network, validating the benefit of joint optimization. Cross-dataset experiments on FastMRI with physics-based artifact simulation further confirm generalization to realistic clinical MRI data. The code and models of MASC have been made publicly available: https://github.com/hrlblab/masc

- **Summary**: Machine unlearning is a key defense mechanism for removing unauthorized concepts from text-to-image diffusion models, yet recent evidence shows that latent visual information often persists after unlearning. Existing adversarial approaches for exploiting this leakage are constrained by fundamental limitations: optimization-based methods are computationally expensive due to per-instance iterative search. At the same time, reasoning-based and heuristic techniques lack direct feedback from the target model's latent visual representations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReLAPSe, a policy-based adversarial framework that reformulates concept restoration as a reinforcement learning problem. ReLAPSe trains an agent using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), leveraging the diffusion model's noise prediction loss as a model-intrinsic and verifiable feedback signal. This closed-loop design directly aligns textual prompt manipulation with latent visual residuals, enabling the agent to learn transferable restoration strategies rather than optimizing isolated prompts. By pioneering the shift from per-instance optimization to global policy learning, ReLAPSe achieves efficient, near-real-time recovery of fine-grained identities and styles across multiple state-of-the-art unlearning methods, providing a scalable tool for rigorous red-teaming of unlearned diffusion models. Some experimental evaluations involve sensitive visual concepts, such as nudity. Code is available at https://github.com/gmum/ReLaPSe

- **Summary**: Rating the accuracy of captions in describing images is time-consuming and subjective for humans. In contrast, it is often easier for people to compare two captions and decide which one better matches a given image. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework that models such comparative judgments instead of direct ratings. The model can then be applied to rank unseen image-caption pairs in the same way as a regression model trained on direct ratings. Using the VICR dataset, we extract visual features with ResNet-50 and text features with MiniLM, then train both a regression model and a comparative learning model. While the regression model achieves better performance (Pearson's $ρ$: 0.7609 and Spearman's $r_s$: 0.7089), the comparative learning model steadily improves with more data and approaches the regression baseline. In addition, a small-scale human evaluation study comparing absolute rating, pairwise comparison, and same-image comparison shows that comparative annotation yields faster results and has greater agreement among human annotators. These results suggest that comparative learning can effectively model human preferences while significantly reducing the cost of human annotations.

- **Summary**: Object detection is a crucial component in autonomous vehicle systems. It enables the vehicle to perceive and understand its environment by identifying and locating various objects around it. By utilizing advanced imaging and deep learning techniques, autonomous vehicle systems can rapidly and accurately identify objects based on their features. Different deep learning methods vary in their ability to accurately detect and classify objects in autonomous vehicle systems. Selecting the appropriate method significantly impacts system performance, robustness, and efficiency in real-world driving scenarios. While several generic deep learning architectures like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN have been proposed, guidance on their suitability for specific autonomous driving applications is often limited. The choice of method affects detection accuracy, processing speed, environmental robustness, sensor integration, scalability, and edge case handling. This study provides a comprehensive experimental analysis comparing two prominent object detection models: YOLOv5 (a one-stage detector) and Faster R-CNN (a two-stage detector). Their performance is evaluated on a diverse dataset combining real and synthetic images, considering various metrics including mean Average Precision (mAP), recall, and inference speed. The findings reveal that YOLOv5 demonstrates superior performance in terms of mAP, recall, and training efficiency, particularly as dataset size and image resolution increase. However, Faster R-CNN shows advantages in detecting small, distant objects and performs well in challenging lighting conditions. The models' behavior is also analyzed under different confidence thresholds and in various real-world scenarios, providing insights into their applicability for autonomous driving systems.

- **Summary**: In this study, we develop a novel methodology for annotating the brain vasculature using dynamic 4D-CTA head scans. By using multiple time points from dynamic CTA acquisitions, we subtract bone and soft tissue to enhance the visualization of arteries and veins, reducing the effort required to obtain manual annotations of brain vessels. We then train deep learning models on our ground truth annotations by using the same segmentation for multiple phases from the dynamic 4D-CTA collection, effectively enlarging our dataset by 4 to 5 times and inducing robustness to contrast phases. In total, our dataset comprises 110 training images from 25 patients and 165 test images from 14 patients. In comparison with two similarly-sized datasets for CTA-based brain vessel segmentation, a nnUNet model trained on our dataset can achieve significantly better segmentations across all vascular regions, with an average mDC of 0.846 for arteries and 0.957 for veins in the TopBrain dataset. Furthermore, metrics such as average directed Hausdorff distance (adHD) and topology sensitivity (tSens) reflected similar trends: using our dataset resulted in low error margins (aDHD of 0.304 mm for arteries and 0.078 for veins) and high sensitivity (tSens of 0.877 for arteries and 0.974 for veins), indicating excellent accuracy in capturing vessel morphology.

- **Summary**: Image captioning (IC) refers to the automatic generation of natural language descriptions for images, with applications ranging from social media content generation to assisting individuals with visual impairments. While most research has been focused on English-based models, low-resource languages such as Brazilian Portuguese face significant challenges due to the lack of specialized datasets and models. Several studies create datasets by automatically translating existing ones to mitigate resource scarcity. This work addresses this gap by proposing a cross-native-translated evaluation of Transformer-based vision and language models for Brazilian Portuguese IC. We use a version of Flickr30K comprised of captions manually created by native Brazilian Portuguese speakers and compare it to a version with captions automatically translated from English to Portuguese. The experiments include a cross-context approach, where models trained on one dataset are tested on the other to assess the translation impact. Additionally, we incorporate attention maps for model inference interpretation and use the CLIP-Score metric to evaluate the image-description alignment. Our findings show that Swin-DistilBERTimbau consistently outperforms other models, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets. ViTucano, a Brazilian Portuguese pre-trained VLM, surpasses larger multilingual models (GPT-4o, LLaMa 3.2 Vision) in traditional text-based evaluation metrics, while GPT-4 models achieve the highest CLIP-Score, highlighting improved image-text alignment. Attention analysis reveals systematic biases, including gender misclassification, object enumeration errors, and spatial inconsistencies.

- **Summary**: Modeling human aesthetic judgments in visual art presents significant challenges due to individual preference variability and the high cost of obtaining labeled data. To reduce cost of acquiring such labels, we propose to apply a comparative learning framework based on pairwise preference assessments rather than direct ratings. This approach leverages the Law of Comparative Judgment, which posits that relative choices exhibit less cognitive burden and greater cognitive consistency than direct scoring. We extract deep convolutional features from painting images using ResNet-50 and develop both a deep neural network regression model and a dual-branch pairwise comparison model. We explored four research questions: (RQ1) How does the proposed deep neural network regression model with CNN features compare to the baseline linear regression model using hand-crafted features? (RQ2) How does pairwise comparative learning compare to regression-based prediction when lacking access to direct rating values? (RQ3) Can we predict individual rater preferences through within-rater and cross-rater analysis? (RQ4) What is the annotation cost trade-off between direct ratings and comparative judgments in terms of human time and effort? Our results show that the deep regression model substantially outperforms the baseline, achieving up to $328\%$ improvement in $R^2$. The comparative model approaches regression performance despite having no access to direct rating values, validating the practical utility of pairwise comparisons. However, predicting individual preferences remains challenging, with both within-rater and cross-rater performance significantly lower than average rating prediction. Human subject experiments reveal that comparative judgments require $60\%$ less annotation time per item, demonstrating superior annotation efficiency for large-scale preference modeling.

- **Summary**: We propose 3DGS$^2$-TR,a second-order optimizer for accelerating the scene training problem in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing second-order approaches that rely on explicit or dense curvature representations, such as 3DGS-LM (Höllein et al., 2025) or 3DGS2 (Lan et al., 2025), our method approximates curvature using only the diagonal of the Hessian matrix, efficiently via Hutchinson's method. Our approach is fully matrix-free and has the same complexity as ADAM (Kingma, 2024), $O(n)$ in both computation and memory costs. To ensure stable optimization in the presence of strong nonlinearity in the 3DGS rasterization process, we introduce a parameter-wise trust-region technique based on the squared Hellinger distance, regularizing updates to Gaussian parameters. Under identical parameter initialization and without densification, 3DGS$^2$-TR is able to achieve better reconstruction quality on standard datasets, using 50% fewer training iterations compared to ADAM, while incurring less than 1GB of peak GPU memory overhead (17% more than ADAM and 85% less than 3DGS-LM), enabling scalability to very large scenes and potentially to distributed training settings.
