- **Summary**: Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS) requires precise intraoperative margin assessment to preserve healthy tissue. Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Scanning Microscopy (DUV-FSM) offers rapid, high-resolution surface imaging for this purpose; however, the scarcity of annotated DUV data hinders the training of robust deep learning models. To address this, we propose an Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-guided Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic training patches. By guiding the LDM with embeddings from a fine-tuned DINO teacher, we inject rich semantic details of cellular structures into the synthetic data. We combine real and synthetic patches to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT), utilizing patch prediction aggregation for WSI-level classification. Experiments using 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that our method achieves 96.47 % accuracy and reduces the FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines.

- **Summary**: Robust Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is crucial for autonomous systems operating in real-world environments, where adverse weather conditions can severely degrade model performance and reliability. In this paper, we introduce RobuMTL, a novel architecture designed to adaptively address visual degradation by dynamically selecting task-specific hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations in a mixture-of-experts fashion. Our framework enables adaptive specialization based on input characteristics, improving robustness across diverse real-world conditions. To validate our approach, we evaluated it on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets and compared it against single-task models, standard MTL baselines, and state-of-the-art methods. On the PASCAL benchmark, RobuMTL delivers a +2.8% average relative improvement under single perturbations and up to +44.4% under mixed weather conditions compared to the MTL baseline. On NYUD-v2, RobuMTL achieves a +9.7% average relative improvement across tasks. The code is available at GitHub.

- **Summary**: Tree canopy detection from aerial imagery is an important task for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ecosystem analysis. Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.

- **Summary**: Traditionally, AI research in medical diagnosis has largely centered on image analysis. While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with complex clinical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our 7B model achieving 27.50 on MedXpert-MM and 83.03 on OmniMedVQA, establishing a robust foundation for reliable multimodal medical reasoning systems.

- **Summary**: Exposure to psychoactive substances during pregnancy, such as cannabis, can disrupt neurodevelopment and alter large-scale brain networks, yet identifying their neural signatures remains challenging. We introduced KOCOBrain: KuramotO COupled Brain Graph Network; a unified graph neural network framework that integrates structural and functional connectomes via Kuramoto-based phase dynamics and cognition-aware attention. The Kuramoto layer models neural synchronization over anatomical connections, generating phase-informed embeddings that capture structure-function coupling, while cognitive scores modulate information routing in a subject-specific manner followed by a joint objective enhancing robustness under class imbalance scenario. Applied to the ABCD cohort, KOCOBrain improved prenatal drug exposure prediction over relevant baselines and revealed interpretable structure-function patterns that reflect disrupted brain network coordination associated with early exposure.

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adapting a classifier for the test data when the probability distribution of the test data slightly differs from that of the training data of the model. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing TTA approaches modify the weights of the classifier relying heavily on the architecture. It is unclear as to how these approaches are extendable to generic architectures. In this article, we propose an architecture-agnostic approach to TTA by adding an adapter network pre-processing the input images suitable to the classifier. This adapter is trained using the proposed quantile loss. Unlike existing approaches, we correct for the distribution shift by matching high-dimensional geometric quantiles. We prove theoretically that under suitable conditions minimizing quantile loss can learn the optimal adapter. We validate our approach on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C and TinyImageNet-C by training both classic convolutional and transformer networks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets.



### IDDR-NGP: Incorporating Detectors for Distractor Removal with Instant Neural Radiance Field

- **Journal**: Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Multimedia. 2023: 1343-1351
- **Summary**: This paper presents the first unified distractor removal method, named IDDR-NGP, which directly operates on Instant-NPG. The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative modeling can create remarkably realistic synthetic videos, making it increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish them from real ones and necessitating reliable detection methods.   However, two key limitations hinder the development of this field.   \textbf{From the dataset perspective}, existing datasets are often limited in scale and constructed using outdated or narrowly scoped generative models, making it difficult to capture the diversity and rapid evolution of modern generative techniques. Moreover, the dataset construction process frequently prioritizes quantity over quality, neglecting essential aspects such as semantic diversity, scenario coverage, and technological representativeness.   \textbf{From the benchmark perspective}, current benchmarks largely remain at the stage of dataset creation, leaving many fundamental issues and in-depth analysis yet to be systematically explored.   Addressing this gap, we propose AIGVDBench, a benchmark designed to be comprehensive and representative, covering \textbf{31} state-of-the-art generation models and over \textbf{440,000} videos. By executing more than \textbf{1,500} evaluations on \textbf{33} existing detectors belonging to four distinct categories. This work presents \textbf{8 in-depth analyses} from multiple perspectives and identifies \textbf{4 novel findings} that offer valuable insights for future research. We hope this work provides a solid foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection.   Our benchmark is open-sourced at https://github.com/LongMa-2025/AIGVDBench.

- **Summary**: No-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) estimates perceptual quality without a reference video, which is often challenging. While recent techniques leverage saliency or transformer attention, they merely address global context of the video signal by using static maps as auxiliary inputs rather than embedding context fundamentally within feature extraction of the video sequence. We present Dynamic Attention with Global Registers for Video Quality Assessment (DAGR-VQA), the first framework integrating register-token directly into a convolutional backbone for spatio-temporal, dynamic saliency prediction. By embedding learnable register tokens as global context carriers, our model enables dynamic, HVS-inspired attention, producing temporally adaptive saliency maps that track salient regions over time without explicit motion estimation. Our model integrates dynamic saliency maps with RGB inputs, capturing spatial data and analyzing it through a temporal transformer to deliver a perceptually consistent video quality assessment. Comprehensive tests conducted on the LSVQ, KonVid-1k, LIVE-VQC, and YouTube-UGC datasets show that the performance is highly competitive, surpassing the majority of top baselines. Research on ablation studies demonstrates that the integration of register tokens promotes the development of stable and temporally consistent attention mechanisms. Achieving an efficiency of 387.7 FPS at 1080p, DAGR-VQA demonstrates computational performance suitable for real-time applications like multimedia streaming systems.

- **Summary**: M3DDM provides a computationally efficient framework for video outpainting via latent diffusion modeling. However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/tamaki-lab/M3DDM-Plus.

- **Summary**: In embodied artificial intelligence, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to execute long-horizon tasks from high-level instructions remains a critical challenge. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in instruction parsing and preliminary planning, they exhibit limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination. We propose Hierarchical Autonomous Intelligent Multi-Robot Planning(H-AIM), a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework that addresses these issues through a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) It leverages an LLM to parse instructions and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem descriptions, thereby transforming commands into formal planning problems; 2) It combines the semantic reasoning of LLMs with the search capabilities of a classical planner to produce optimized action sequences; 3) It compiles the resulting plan into behavior trees for reactive control. The framework supports dynamically sized heterogeneous robot teams via a shared blackboard mechanism for communication and state synchronization. To validate our approach, we introduce the MACE-THOR benchmark dataset, comprising 42 complex tasks across 8 distinct household layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that H-AIM achieves a remarkable performance improvement, elevating the task success rate from 12% to 55% and boosting the goal condition recall from 32% to 72% against the strongest baseline, LaMMA-P.

- **Summary**: Interpretation of imaging findings based on morphological characteristics is important for diagnosing pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography (CT) images. In this study, we constructed a visual question answering (VQA) dataset from structured data in an open dataset and investigated an image-finding generation method for chest CT images, with the aim of enabling interactive diagnostic support that presents findings based on questions that reflect physicians' interests rather than fixed descriptions. In this study, chest CT images included in the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) datasets were used. Regions of interest surrounding the pulmonary nodules were extracted from these images, and image findings and questions were defined based on morphological characteristics recorded in the database. A dataset comprising pairs of cropped images, corresponding questions, and image findings was constructed, and the VQA model was fine-tuned on it. Language evaluation metrics such as BLEU were used to evaluate the generated image findings. The VQA dataset constructed using the proposed method contained image findings with natural expressions as radiological descriptions. In addition, the generated image findings showed a high CIDEr score of 3.896, and a high agreement with the reference findings was obtained through evaluation based on morphological characteristics. We constructed a VQA dataset for chest CT images using structured information on the morphological characteristics from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Methods for generating image findings in response to these questions have also been investigated. Based on the generated results and evaluation metric scores, the proposed method was effective as an interactive diagnostic support system that can present image findings according to physicians' interests.

- **Summary**: Recently, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed to support diagnosis, but their performance depends heavily on the quality and quantity of training data. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to collect the large amount of CT images for specific cases, such as small cell carcinoma with low epidemiological incidence or benign tumors that are difficult to distinguish from malignant ones. This leads to the challenge of data imbalance. In this study, to address this issue, we proposed a method to automatically generate chest CT nodule images that capture target features using latent diffusion models (LDM) and verified its effectiveness. Using the LIDC-IDRI dataset, we created pairs of nodule images and finding-based text prompts based on physician evaluations. For the image generation models, we used Stable Diffusion version 1.5 (SDv1) and 2.0 (SDv2), which are types of LDM. Each model was fine-tuned using the created dataset. During the generation process, we adjusted the guidance scale (GS), which indicates the fidelity to the input text. Both quantitative and subjective evaluations showed that SDv2 (GS = 5) achieved the best performance in terms of image quality, diversity, and text consistency. In the subjective evaluation, no statistically significant differences were observed between the generated images and real images, confirming that the quality was equivalent to real clinical images. We proposed a method for generating chest CT nodule images based on input text using LDM. Evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method could generate high-quality images that successfully capture specific medical features.

- **Summary**: Physical principles are fundamental to realistic visual simulation, but remain a significant oversight in transformer-based video generation. This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Character image animation is gaining significant importance across various domains, driven by the demand for robust and flexible multi-subject rendering. While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts. The code and weights will be open-sourced.

- **Summary**: Graph-based methods have proven to be effective in capturing relationships among points for 3D point cloud analysis. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections. Based on the optimized graph structure, we improve the feature extract function with local geometry information. These include shape features derived from adaptive geometric descriptors based on eigenvectors and distribution features obtained through cylindrical coordinate transformation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in various point cloud learning tasks, i.e., classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Understanding how neural activity gives rise to perception is a central challenge in neuroscience. We address the problem of decoding visual information from high-density intracortical recordings in primates, using the THINGS Ventral Stream Spiking Dataset. We systematically evaluate the effects of model architecture, training objectives, and data scaling on decoding performance. Results show that decoding accuracy is mainly driven by modeling temporal dynamics in neural signals, rather than architectural complexity. A simple model combining temporal attention with a shallow MLP achieves up to 70% top-1 image retrieval accuracy, outperforming linear baselines as well as recurrent and convolutional approaches. Scaling analyses reveal predictable diminishing returns with increasing input dimensionality and dataset size. Building on these findings, we design a modular generative decoding pipeline that combines low-resolution latent reconstruction with semantically conditioned diffusion, generating plausible images from 200 ms of brain activity. This framework provides principles for brain-computer interfaces and semantic neural decoding.

- **Summary**: Vision-as-inverse-graphics, the concept of reconstructing an image as an editable graphics program is a long-standing goal of computer vision. Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation tackles the problem that domain shifts between training and test data impair the performance of neural networks in many real-world applications. Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

- **Summary**: Standard softmax self-attention excels in vision tasks but incurs quadratic complexity O(N^2), limiting high-resolution deployment. Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. On ImageNet-1K, SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by a considerable margin. Code will be released.

- **Summary**: The rapid evolution of satellite-borne Earth Observation (EO) systems has revolutionized terrestrial monitoring, yielding petabyte-scale archives. However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543). By condensing the annual phenological cycle into 12 temporal steps, the embeddings provide inherent denoising and a semantically organized space that outperforms raw reflectance in land-cover classification, achieving 79.74% accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw fusion). With robust few-shot learning capabilities and longitudinal consistency, ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research and advancing next-generation geospatial artificial intelligence.

- **Summary**: We suggest a new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples with Rectified Flow models. While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples. Our method improves the state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, it is able to show comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of powerful Text-to-Video (T2V) models, trained on massive web-scale datasets, raises urgent concerns about copyright and privacy violations. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled tool for auditing such risks, yet existing techniques - designed for static data like images or text - fail to capture the spatio-temporal complexities of video generation. In particular, they overlook the sparsity of memorization signals in keyframes and the instability introduced by stochastic temporal dynamics. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of MIAs against T2V models and introduce a novel framework VidLeaks, which probes sparse-temporal memorization through two complementary signals: 1) Spatial Reconstruction Fidelity (SRF), using a Top-K similarity to amplify spatial memorization signals from sparsely memorized keyframes, and 2) Temporal Generative Stability (TGS), which measures semantic consistency across multiple queries to capture temporal leakage. We evaluate VidLeaks under three progressively restrictive black-box settings - supervised, reference-based, and query-only. Experiments on three representative T2V models reveal severe vulnerabilities: VidLeaks achieves AUC of 82.92% on AnimateDiff and 97.01% on InstructVideo even in the strict query-only setting, posing a realistic and exploitable privacy risk. Our work provides the first concrete evidence that T2V models leak substantial membership information through both sparse and temporal memorization, establishing a foundation for auditing video generation systems and motivating the development of new defenses.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has significantly advanced image analysis across diverse domains but often depends on large, annotated datasets for success. Transfer learning addresses this challenge by utilizing pre-trained models to tackle new tasks with limited labeled data. However, discrepancies between source and target domains can hinder effective transfer learning. We introduce BioTune, a novel adaptive fine-tuning technique utilizing evolutionary optimization. BioTune enhances transfer learning by optimally choosing which layers to freeze and adjusting learning rates for unfrozen layers. Through extensive evaluation on nine image classification datasets, spanning natural and specialized domains such as medical imaging, BioTune demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods, including AutoRGN and LoRA, highlighting its adaptability to various data characteristics and distribution changes. Additionally, BioTune consistently achieves top performance across four different CNN architectures, underscoring its flexibility. Ablation studies provide valuable insights into the impact of BioTune's key components on overall performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/davilac/BioTune.

- **Summary**: We propose unsupervised multi-scenario (UMS) person re-identification (ReID) as a new task that expands ReID across diverse scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing change, etc.) within a single coherent framework. To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.

- **Summary**: Handwritten word retrieval is vital for digital archives but remains challenging due to large handwriting variability and cross-lingual semantic gaps. While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles. Experiments show that our method outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks. We further conduct explicit cross-lingual retrieval, where the query language differs from the target language, to validate the effectiveness of the learned cross-lingual representations. Achieving strong performance with only a fraction of the parameters required by existing models, our framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset. The code and MUVAD dataset will be available at: https://github.com/uavano/FTDMamba.

- **Summary**: Visuomotor policies often leverage large pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) for their powerful generalization capabilities. However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.

- **Summary**: Effective disaster response relies on rapid disaster response, where oblique aerial video is the primary modality for initial scouting due to its ability to maximize spatial coverage and situational awareness in limited flight time. However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions

- **Summary**: Current research workflows for precise video segmentation are often forced into a compromise between labor-intensive manual curation, costly commercial platforms, and/or privacy-compromising cloud-based services. The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.

- **Summary**: Semantic ultra high resolution image (UHR) segmentation is essential in remote sensing applications such as aerial mapping and environmental monitoring. Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR, CASWiT achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing the current SoTA by +0.9% under the official evaluation protocol. All codes are provided on: https://huggingface.co/collections/heig-vd-geo/caswit.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the ability to generate high-level, interpretable descriptions of complex activities from images and videos, making them valuable for situational awareness (SA) applications. In such settings, the focus is on identifying infrequent but significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while also extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.

- **Summary**: Separating the contributions of individual chromogenic stains in RGB histology whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for stain normalization, quantitative assessment of marker expression, and cell-level readouts in immunohistochemistry (IHC). Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

- **Summary**: Climate change is intensifying human heat exposure, particularly in densely built urban centers of the Global South. Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning. Our results point to the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment in shaping climate adaptation strategies that deliver equitable outcomes.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced video understanding. However, their performance on long-form videos remains limited by computational constraints and suboptimal frame selection. We present Think-Clip-Sample (TCS), a training-free framework that enhances long video understanding through two key components: (i) Multi-Query Reasoning, which generates multiple queries to capture complementary aspects of the question and video; and (ii) Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling, which adaptively balances dense local details and sparse global context. Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.

- **Summary**: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables image search by combining a reference image with modification text. Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.

- **Summary**: As autonomous driving moves toward full scene understanding, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has emerged as a crucial perception task, offering voxel-level semantics beyond traditional detection and segmentation paradigms. However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.

- **Summary**: Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.

- **Summary**: Surface defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) directly compromise product reliability and safety. However, achieving high-precision detection is challenging because PCB defects are typically characterized by tiny sizes, high texture similarity, and uneven scale distributions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework based on YOLOv11n, named SME-YOLO (Small-target Multi-scale Enhanced YOLO). First, we employ the Normalized Wasserstein Distance Loss (NWDLoss). This metric effectively mitigates the sensitivity of Intersection over Union (IoU) to positional deviations in tiny objects. Second, the original upsampling module is replaced by the Efficient Upsampling Convolution Block (EUCB). By utilizing multi-scale convolutions, the EUCB gradually recovers spatial resolution and enhances the preservation of edge and texture details for tiny defects. Finally, this paper proposes the Multi-Scale Focused Attention (MSFA) module. Tailored to the specific spatial distribution of PCB defects, this module adaptively strengthens perception within key scale intervals, achieving efficient fusion of local fine-grained features and global context information. Experimental results on the PKU-PCB dataset demonstrate that SME-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, SME-YOLO improves mAP by 2.2% and Precision by 4%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Existing research highlights the crucial role of topological priors in image segmentation, particularly in preserving essential structures such as connectivity and genus. Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.

- **Summary**: We propose Map2Thought, a framework that enables explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs. The framework is grounded in two key components: Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT). Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% under 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets, respectively, on the VSI-Bench.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).

- **Summary**: Large-scale livestock operations pose significant risks to human health and the environment, while also being vulnerable to threats such as infectious diseases and extreme weather events. As the number of such operations continues to grow, accurate and scalable mapping has become increasingly important. In this work, we present an infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline for identifying and characterizing Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) from aerial and satellite imagery. Our method (1) detects candidate infrastructure (e.g., barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) with a domain-tuned YOLOv8 detector, then derives SAM2 masks from these boxes and filters component-specific criteria, (2) extracts structured descriptors (e.g., counts, areas, orientations, and spatial relations) and fuses them with deep visual features using a lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier, and (3) outputs both CAFO type predictions and mask-level attributions that link decisions to visible infrastructure. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Swin-B+PRISM-CAFO surpassing the best performing baseline by up to 15\%. Beyond strong predictive performance across diverse U.S. regions, we run systematic gradient--activation analyses that quantify the impact of domain priors and show ho

- **Summary**: As vision-language models (VLMs) tackle increasingly complex and multimodal tasks, the rapid growth of Key-Value (KV) cache imposes significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference. While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as highly effective planning models for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness. These results highlight the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: In the generative AI era, where even critical medical tasks are increasingly automated, radiology report generation (RRG) continues to rely on suboptimal metrics for quality assessment. Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 "disagreement" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection. We will release the framework, code, and allowable portion of the anonymized evaluation data (rephrased/error-injected CT reports), to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and future metric development.

- **Summary**: Indoor environments evolve as objects move, appear, or disappear. Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.

- **Summary**: Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.
