- **Summary**: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield, and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually, requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task (time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github. com/ronan-39/tlt/).

- **Summary**: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family (e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP, which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the $\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space.

- **Summary**: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes, four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than 100%.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient, as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks: super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from unauthorized knowledge distillation.

- **Summary**: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However, their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD) counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73% performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The code and data will be released shortly.

- **Summary**: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

- **Summary**: Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims at deliver accurate and reliable results for clinical decision-making. Most existing methods adopt the evidence deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and theoretical robustness. However, the EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary segmentation. To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature representation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank learning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for challenging regions. Concurrently, standard EDL methods suppress evidence of incorrect class indiscriminately via Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization, impairing the uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas and consequently distorts the corresponding attention guidance. We thus introduce a semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy, integrating a semantic-smooth evidence generator and a fidelity-enhancing regularization term to retain critical semantics. Finally, by embedding PEUA and SAEL with the state-of-the-art U-KAN, we proposes Evidential U-KAN, a novel solution for trustworthy medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over the competing methods.

- **Summary**: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers enhanced spatial resolution and tissue contrast that enables the detection of subtle pathological changes in neurological disorders. However, the limited availability of 7T scanners restricts widespread clinical adoption due to substantial infrastructure costs and technical demands. Computational approaches for synthesizing 7T-quality images from accessible 3T acquisitions present a viable solution to this accessibility challenge. Existing CNN approaches suffer from limited spatial coverage, while Transformer models demand excessive computational overhead. RWKV architectures offer an efficient alternative for global feature modeling in medical image synthesis, combining linear computational complexity with strong long-range dependency capture. Building on this foundation, we propose Frequency Spatial-RWKV (FS-RWKV), an RWKV-based framework for 3T-to-7T MRI translation. To better address the challenges of anatomical detail preservation and global tissue contrast recovery, FS-RWKV incorporates two key modules: (1) Frequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift (FSO-Shift), which performs discrete wavelet decomposition followed by omnidirectional spatial shifting on the low-frequency branch to enhance global contextual representation while preserving high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) Structural Fidelity Enhancement Block (SFEB), a module that adaptively reinforces anatomical structure through frequency-aware feature fusion. Comprehensive experiments on UNC and BNU datasets demonstrate that FS-RWKV consistently outperforms existing CNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines across both T1w and T2w modalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality.

- **Summary**: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small, occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds, environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios, bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.



### Unleashing Perception-Time Scaling to Multimodal Reasoning Models

- **Summary**: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks. Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%, and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of 3D medical images is critical for clinical applications like disease assessment and treatment planning. While the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable success in video object segmentation by leveraging temporal cues, its direct application to 3D medical images faces two fundamental domain gaps: 1) the bidirectional anatomical continuity between slices contrasts sharply with the unidirectional temporal flow in videos, and 2) precise boundary delineation, crucial for morphological analysis, is often underexplored in video tasks. To bridge these gaps, we propose SAM2-3dMed, an adaptation of SAM2 for 3D medical imaging. Our framework introduces two key innovations: 1) a Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP) module explicitly models bidirectional inter-slice dependencies by guiding SAM2 to predict the relative positions of different slices in a self-supervised manner; 2) a Boundary Detection (BD) module enhances segmentation accuracy along critical organ and tissue boundaries. Extensive experiments on three diverse medical datasets (the Lung, Spleen, and Pancreas in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset) demonstrate that SAM2-3dMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in segmentation overlap and boundary precision. Our approach not only advances 3D medical image segmentation performance but also offers a general paradigm for adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.

- **Summary**: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations, over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below 4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications. However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval - HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment. Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.



### HandEval: Taking the First Step Towards Hand Quality Evaluation in Generated Images

- **Summary**: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

- **Summary**: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

- **Summary**: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory. Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE) with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other prior arts.

- **Summary**: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive (AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution. Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed. Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding, achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation quality and sampling speed.

- **Summary**: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL) and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data. We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks.

- **Summary**: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500 samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably, Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

- **Summary**: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817 patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models. Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse medical image translation tasks.

- **Summary**: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across its business units.

- **Summary**: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation. Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints, approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically, across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

- **Summary**: We introduce MMAudioSep, a generative model for video/text-queried sound separation that is founded on a pretrained video-to-audio model. By leveraging knowledge about the relationship between video/text and audio learned through a pretrained audio generative model, we can train the model more efficiently, i.e., the model does not need to be trained from scratch. We evaluate the performance of MMAudioSep by comparing it to existing separation models, including models based on both deterministic and generative approaches, and find it is superior to the baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even after acquiring functionality for sound separation via fine-tuning, the model retains the ability for original video-to-audio generation. This highlights the potential of foundational sound generation models to be adopted for sound-related downstream tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/sony/mmaudiosep.

- **Summary**: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point, respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image datasets collected from our implantation system.

- **Summary**: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However, existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

- **Summary**: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT) technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However, complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g., FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\% while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for efficient text-to-image generation.

- **Summary**: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features. This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline, from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets. Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set, achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical diagnostics.

- **Summary**: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.   We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K) on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4 $N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in visual grounding.

- **Summary**: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies, present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

- **Summary**: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$ complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$, representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis applications.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features (e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution methods fail to expose.

- **Summary**: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities. The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test sequences.

- **Summary**: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption, limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to 29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power hardware.

- **Summary**: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model, achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety, i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement and causal correlation among multiple explanations.

- **Summary**: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health, productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6 dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking, standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows. Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding, drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.



### 3D Reconstruction from Transient Measurements with Time-Resolved Transformer

- **Summary**: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the 3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements. Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

- **Summary**: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting (e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions (e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks, including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

- **Summary**: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations. A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer electronics.

- **Summary**: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are further classified based on their scope: single-task models, multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart transportation environments. Lastly, to stay current with rapid advancements in this field, we will maintain regular updates of the latest relevant papers and their open-source implementations at https://github.com/ChaudharyUPES/A-comprehensive-review-on-Multi-weather-restoration

- **Summary**: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis), are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework (HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons, the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by 79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video understanding in the medical field.

- **Summary**: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods. Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image perturbations.

- **Summary**: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500 images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across 706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and 63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering strategy for clinical VLM applications.

- **Summary**: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis, and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations - Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and 0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability. The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer interaction.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers. Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions. In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at https://goba-attack.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues, while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated \texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP), which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate accumulated errors.

- **Summary**: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks, VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models, with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales. Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of LVLMs.

- **Summary**: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications, including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However, deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups, overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets, methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex, real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and adaptive CVS.

- **Summary**: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study, we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4 million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

- **Summary**: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to 73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance, enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is critical for studying early neurodevelopment and diagnosing neurological disorders. Yet, it remains a fundamental challenge due to continuously evolving anatomy of the subjects, motion artifacts, and the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. In this work, we present LODi, a novel framework that utilizes prior knowledge from an adult brain MRI segmentation model to enhance the segmentation performance of infant scans. Given the abundance of publicly available adult brain MRI data, we pre-train a segmentation model on a large adult dataset as a starting point. Through transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies, we progressively adapt the model to the 0-2 year-old population, enabling it to account for the anatomical and imaging variability typical of infant scans. The adaptation of the adult model is carried out using weakly supervised learning on infant brain scans, leveraging silver-standard ground truth labels obtained with FreeSurfer. By introducing a novel training strategy that integrates hierarchical feature refinement and multi-level consistency constraints, our method enables fast, accurate, age-adaptive segmentation, while mitigating scanner and site-specific biases. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional supervised learning and domain-specific models. Our findings highlight the advantage of leveraging adult brain priors as a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging analysis, paving the way for more reliable and generalizable brain MRI segmentation across the lifespan.

- **Summary**: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency, which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling. Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over 4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline (RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable, energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G networks.

- **Summary**: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2, ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception.

- **Summary**: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods, while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully supervised methods in some scenarios.

- **Summary**: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence. Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust, interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

- **Summary**: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details, but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a notable 8.76\% improvement.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs. Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the "overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress, particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models. BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically, achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inpainting supports numerous clinical and research applications. We introduce the first generative model that conditions on voxel-level, continuous tumor concentrations to synthesize high-fidelity brain tumor MRIs. For the BraTS 2025 Inpainting Challenge, we adapt this architecture to the complementary task of healthy tissue restoration by setting the tumor concentrations to zero. Our latent diffusion model conditioned on both tissue segmentations and the tumor concentrations generates 3D spatially coherent and anatomically consistent images for both tumor synthesis and healthy tissue inpainting. For healthy inpainting, we achieve a PSNR of 18.5, and for tumor inpainting, we achieve 17.4. Our code is available at: https://github.com/valentin-biller/ldm.git

- **Summary**: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring. While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM) into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

- **Summary**: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models (VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs. Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

- **Summary**: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge, especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification (SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers without full model retraining.

- **Summary**: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication. However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies: Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn exchanges in code generation.

- **Summary**: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor, a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally, targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

- **Summary**: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast, and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images. Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP) of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/SilvaScenes.

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

- **Summary**: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters, thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and highlighting the potential of our method.

- **Summary**: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust, generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However, inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g. SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

- **Summary**: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

- **Summary**: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification. We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

- **Summary**: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations, where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements, but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp (ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD, and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

- **Summary**: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics, requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however, extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING (FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications - including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing - show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at http://schardong.github.io/flowing.

- **Summary**: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic, multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic, parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

- **Summary**: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' - the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions. ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2, we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts. Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon, planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in the ever more challenging environments.

- **Summary**: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision. Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in low-shot and open-set scenarios.

- **Summary**: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across 26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2) steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs, parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones; contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues and years.

- **Summary**: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty, diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts, a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines.

- **Summary**: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness, and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+ datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30 archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity, demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware time series modeling.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas, all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image, reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important, without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA, DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when given such warped inputs.

- **Summary**: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally, extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench, demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However, training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement), which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks, a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks, which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense, per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning, improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by +5.96.

- **Summary**: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational circuits.

- **Summary**: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

- **Summary**: Today's visuo-tactile sensors come in many shapes and sizes, making it challenging to develop general-purpose tactile representations. This is because most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data (T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process. Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation, depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

- **Summary**: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

- **Summary**: The output of image the segmentation process is usually not very clear due to low quality features of Satellite images. The purpose of this study is to find a suitable Conditional Random Field (CRF) to achieve better clarity in a segmented image. We started with different types of CRFs and studied them as to why they are or are not suitable for our purpose. We evaluated our approach on two different datasets - Satellite imagery having low quality features and high quality Aerial photographs. During the study we experimented with various CRFs to find which CRF gives the best results on images and compared our results on these datasets to show the pitfalls and potentials of different approaches.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training. However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity, which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge, we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries), to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: The lightweight ad ranking layer, living after the retrieval stage and before the fine ranker, plays a critical role in the success of a cascaded ad recommendation system. Due to the fact that there are multiple optimization tasks depending on the ad domain, e.g., Click Through Rate (CTR) for click ads and Conversion Rate (CVR) for conversion ads, as well as multiple surfaces where an ad is served (home feed, search, or related item recommendation) with diverse ad products (shopping or standard ad); it is an essentially challenging problem in industry on how to do joint holistic optimization in the lightweight ranker, such that the overall platform's value, advertiser's value, and user's value are maximized.   Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based multitask learning (MTL) can handle multiple goals naturally, with each prediction head mapping to a particular optimization goal. However, in practice, it is unclear how to unify data from different surfaces and ad products into a single model. It is critical to learn domain-specialized knowledge and explicitly transfer knowledge between domains to make MTL effective. We present a Multi-Task Multi-Domain (MTMD) architecture under the classic Two-Tower paradigm, with the following key contributions: 1) handle different prediction tasks, ad products, and ad serving surfaces in a unified framework; 2) propose a novel mixture-of-expert architecture to learn both specialized knowledge each domain and common knowledge shared between domains; 3) propose a domain adaption module to encourage knowledge transfer between experts; 4) constrain the modeling of different prediction tasks. MTMD improves the offline loss value by 12% to 36%, mapping to 2% online reduction in cost per click. We have deployed this single MTMD framework into production for Pinterest ad recommendation replacing 9 production models.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction. Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts, ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with linear motion, such as MOT17.

- **Summary**: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content (UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG: Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos, transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse, and real-world UGC dataset.

- **Summary**: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures. However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations, significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

- **Summary**: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

- **Summary**: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation, surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking. The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features, enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition, and environmental monitoring tasks.   Keywords: SpectralCA, deep learning, computer vision, hyperspectral imaging, unmanned aerial vehicle, object detection, semi-supervised learning.

- **Summary**: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration, reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both general image and aligned face datasets.
