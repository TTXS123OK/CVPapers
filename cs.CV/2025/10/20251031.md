- **Summary**: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level. This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing 3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention (ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks. Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes to democratization of generative AI models.

- **Summary**: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM), which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views, enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module (MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone" localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in "Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming, film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling, which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition. HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph (PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D scene construction.



### AFM-Net: Advanced Fusing Hierarchical CNN Visual Priors with Global Sequence Modeling for Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification

- **Summary**: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task, primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However, efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency.

- **Summary**: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g), peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant pathology.



### Generating Accurate and Detailed Captions for High-Resolution Images

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels). Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused, region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.



### M^3Detection: Multi-Frame Multi-Level Feature Fusion for Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection with Camera and 4D Imaging Radar

- **Summary**: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity, hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction. Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

- **Summary**: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks, human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and codes will be released upon acceptance.



### H2-Cache: A Novel Hierarchical Dual-Stage Cache for High-Performance Acceleration of Generative Diffusion Models

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of high-fidelity diffusion models.

  Symposium (PETS 2026)
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos. Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.

- **Summary**: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples. Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper, we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy. At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints. However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge transfer.

- **Summary**: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding, makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

- **Summary**: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83 (independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and generative logic.

- **Summary**: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning, which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent, \textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance. Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI navigation tasks. Code is available at https://leon022.github.io/GUI-Rise.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging, mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship between previously learned knowledge and new information across different training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images. Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other approaches.



### SpecAware: A Spectral-Content Aware Foundation Model for Unifying Multi-Sensor Learning in Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Mapping

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training. Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.

- **Summary**: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings. Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.

- **Summary**: Accurate building instance segmentation and height classification are critical for urban planning, 3D city modeling, and infrastructure monitoring. This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery. YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales, improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex urban scenes. Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000 annotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP). Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance, particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that YOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and inference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban mapping. This research highlights YOLOv11's potential to advance semantic urban reconstruction through streamlined categorical height modeling, offering actionable insights for future developments in remote sensing and geospatial intelligence.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of 3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense 3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective downstream applications without extra computation.

- **Summary**: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints. Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for 1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade GPUs.

- **Summary**: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs. However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity caused by diverse private training datasets and different network architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs, called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

- **Summary**: In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks, restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images, which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks. Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy, substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and adversarial training approaches.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of adversarial robustness in deep learning.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot action recognition by learning to associate video embeddings with class embeddings. However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and 68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600, respectively, underscoring the model's adaptability and effectiveness across various downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on average and increases question answering accuracy by 3.56\% while using only 71.42\% visual tokens compared to prior methods.

- **Summary**: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality: pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques, designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3 dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities. Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings.

- **Summary**: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this, we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism, combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence and supports more reliable GUI automation.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.   We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces. Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE (Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training time by 90%.

- **Summary**: Medical image super-resolution (SR) is essential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy while reducing acquisition cost and scanning time. However, modeling both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details with low computational overhead remains challenging. We propose FGMamba, a novel frequency-aware gated state-space model that unifies global dependency modeling and fine-detail enhancement into a lightweight architecture. Our method introduces two key innovations: a Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module (GASM) that integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial and channel attention, and a Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that captures high-frequency details across multiple resolutions via FFT-guided fusion. Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities (Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic) demonstrate that FGMamba achieves superior PSNR/SSIM while maintaining a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M), outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs. Our results validate the effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate medical image enhancement.

- **Summary**: Medical images play a crucial role in assisting diagnosis, remote consultation, and academic research. However, during the transmission and sharing process, they face serious risks of copyright ownership and content tampering. Therefore, protecting medical images is of great importance. As an effective means of image copyright protection, zero-watermarking technology focuses on constructing watermarks without modifying the original carrier by extracting its stable features, which provides an ideal approach for protecting medical images. This paper aims to propose a fragile zero-watermarking model based on dual quaternion matrix decomposition, which utilizes the operational relationship between the standard part and the dual part of dual quaternions to correlate the original carrier image with the watermark image, and generates zero-watermarking information based on the characteristics of dual quaternion matrix decomposition, ultimately achieving copyright protection and content tampering detection for medical images.

- **Summary**: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by 0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection (P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among existing baselines.

- **Summary**: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction, achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However, reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline. Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS, a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement. Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better visualization quality.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

  Challenge

- **Summary**: The ODELIA Breast MRI Challenge 2025 addresses a critical issue in breast cancer screening: improving early detection through more efficient and accurate interpretation of breast MRI scans. Even though methods for general-purpose whole-body lesion segmentation as well as multi-time-point analysis exist, breast cancer detection remains highly challenging, largely due to the limited availability of high-quality segmentation labels. Therefore, developing robust classification-based approaches is crucial for the future of early breast cancer detection, particularly in applications such as large-scale screening. In this write-up, we provide a comprehensive overview of our approach to the challenge. We begin by detailing the underlying concept and foundational assumptions that guided our work. We then describe the iterative development process, highlighting the key stages of experimentation, evaluation, and refinement that shaped the evolution of our solution. Finally, we present the reasoning and evidence that informed the design choices behind our final submission, with a focus on performance, robustness, and clinical relevance. We release our full implementation publicly at https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/MeisenMeister

- **Summary**: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage \textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions, eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks. Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing. CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset are available at \href{https://github.com/Jia-shao/Reasoning-Editing}{https://github.com/Jia-shao/Reasoning-Editing}.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images, offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements. Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch. Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities. We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available in https://huggingface.co/qihoo360/RzenEmbed.

- **Summary**: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters [1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2] require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.



### Fine-Tuning Open Video Generators for Cinematic Scene Synthesis: A Small-Data Pipeline with LoRA and Wan2.1 I2V

- **Summary**: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage, the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study, demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

- **Summary**: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities. Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold. Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

- **Summary**: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis, which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively. Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87 at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations (F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82 percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

- **Summary**: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently, embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

- **Summary**: Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where both the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI, a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in highly degraded scenarios.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size. These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.

- **Summary**: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and post-editability. However, current generative models have two major limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol. VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception, and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models, presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of illustrations.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers, medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements. The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate, and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

- **Summary**: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal artifacts. By matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and target content into cross-modal features, Referee jointly reasons about audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency. Extensive experiments on FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate that Referee achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation protocols. Experimental results highlight the importance of cross-modal identity verification for future deepfake detection. The code is available at https://github.com/ewha-mmai/referee.

- **Summary**: Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration, national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods, which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities. However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding, we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS. Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area.

- **Summary**: Accurate lung tumor segmentation is vital for improving diagnosis and treatment planning, and effectively combining anatomical and functional information from PET and CT remains a major challenge. In this study, we propose vMambaX, a lightweight multimodal framework integrating PET and CT scan images through a Context-Gated Cross-Modal Perception Module (CGM). Built on the Visual Mamba architecture, vMambaX adaptively enhances inter-modality feature interaction, emphasizing informative regions while suppressing noise. Evaluated on the PCLT20K dataset, the model outperforms baseline models while maintaining lower computational complexity. These results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive cross-modal gating for multimodal tumor segmentation and demonstrate the potential of vMambaX as an efficient and scalable framework for advanced lung cancer analysis.

- **Summary**: The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement, as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of 3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack, which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.

- **Summary**: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video, enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations. Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code to support future research.

- **Summary**: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training. Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data. Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance toward truly universal video retrieval.

- **Summary**: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

- **Summary**: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw. The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small, imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision. Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and robustness.

- **Summary**: The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones, raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing supervised detectors often struggle to generalize across unseen generators, requiring extensive labeled data and frequent retraining. We introduce FRIDA (Fake-image Recognition and source Identification via Diffusion-features Analysis), a lightweight framework that leverages internal activations from a pre-trained diffusion model for deepfake detection and source generator attribution. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier applied to diffusion features achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance without fine-tuning, while a compact neural model enables accurate source attribution. These results show that diffusion representations inherently encode generator-specific patterns, providing a simple and interpretable foundation for synthetic image forensics.

- **Summary**: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision, specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure: shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting, regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

- **Summary**: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this, we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods, while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by 13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data. These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world deployment.

- **Summary**: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored. To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet, DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k) synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/sketch_to_layout.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures, encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains, requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

- **Summary**: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents, consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator during training to derive the common representation from the local representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual transformation of features between the local representation space and the common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To better align local representations to the common representation containing multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully distilled into the sender.

- **Summary**: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD). Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization, which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets.

- **Summary**: Class imbalance poses a fundamental challenge in machine learning, frequently leading to unreliable classification performance. While prior methods focus on data- or loss-reweighting schemes, we view imbalance as a data condition that amplifies Clever Hans (CH) effects by underspecification of minority classes. In a counterfactual explanations-based approach, we propose to leverage Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate CH effects emerging under imbalance. Our method achieves competitive classification performance on three datasets and demonstrates how CH effects emerge under imbalance, a perspective largely overlooked by existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization. Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited techniques.

- **Summary**: Person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance is challenged by occlusion, viewpoint distortion, and poor image quality. Most existing methods rely on complex modules or perform well only on clear frontal images. We propose Sh-ViT (Shuffling Vision Transformer), a lightweight and robust model for occluded person ReID. Built on ViT-Base, Sh-ViT introduces three components: First, a Shuffle module in the final Transformer layer to break spatial correlations and enhance robustness to occlusion and blur; Second, scenario-adapted augmentation (geometric transforms, erasing, blur, and color adjustment) to simulate surveillance conditions; Third, DeiT-based knowledge distillation to improve learning with limited labels.To support real-world evaluation, we construct the MyTT dataset, containing over 10,000 pedestrians and 30,000+ images from base station inspections, with frequent equipment occlusion and camera variations. Experiments show that Sh-ViT achieves 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on MyTT, outperforming CNN and ViT baselines, and 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on Market1501, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.In summary, Sh-ViT improves robustness to occlusion and blur without external modules, offering a practical solution for surveillance-based personnel monitoring.

- **Summary**: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer screening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack LDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer detection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of 26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI) radiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar microstructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly improve early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning segmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of euthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular boundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A U-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI, or a combination of ATTN and DFI channels. Results show that the DFI-only model achieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51 percent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus 92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent sensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially improves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation radiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose alternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is unavailable.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data, small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset, we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET, CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.

- **Summary**: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However, limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency. While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative capabilities. We will release our code and models.

- **Summary**: Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers a promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet, a lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis (MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use fixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.
