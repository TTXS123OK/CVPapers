- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced video understanding, but their performance is limited by the number of input frames they can process. Existing frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, often fail to adapt to variations in information density or task complexity, resulting in inefficiency and information loss. To address this, we present FrameOracle, a lightweight and plug-and-play module that predicts both (1) which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are needed. FrameOracle is trained using a four-stage curriculum, with the first three stages relying on weak proxy signals such as cross-modal similarity. In the final stage, it leverages stronger supervision from a new dataset we introduce, FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA collection to provide keyframe annotations specifying the minimal set of frames required to answer each question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4 frames without any loss in accuracy. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it reduces the input to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by 1.4%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable video understanding.

- **Summary**: Manual identification of visual bugs in video games is a resource-intensive and costly process, often demanding specialized domain knowledge. While supervised visual bug detection models offer a promising solution, their reliance on extensive labeled datasets presents a significant challenge due to the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method that effectively integrates both labeled and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled samples from the target game and diverse co-domain games, additionally incorporating unlabeled data to enhance feature representation learning. This strategy maximizes the utility of all available data, substantially reducing the dependency on labeled examples from the specific target game. The developed framework demonstrates enhanced scalability and adaptability, facilitating efficient visual bug detection across various game titles. Our experimental results show the robustness of the proposed method for game visual bug detection, exhibiting superior performance compared to conventional baselines across multiple gaming environments. Furthermore, CFT maintains competitive performance even when trained with only 50% of the labeled data from the target game.

- **Summary**: This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches 65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains 77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model may allow it to improve greatly.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have made it possible to learn general-purpose visual features that capture both the high-level semantics and the fine-grained spatial structure of images. Most notably, the recent DINOv2 has established a new state of the art by surpassing weakly supervised methods (WSL) like OpenCLIP on most benchmarks. In this survey, we examine the core ideas behind its approach, multi-crop view augmentation and self-distillation with a mean teacher, and trace their development in previous work. We then compare the performance of DINO and DINOv2 with other SSL and WSL methods across various downstream tasks, and highlight some remarkable emergent properties of their learned features with transformer backbones. We conclude by briefly discussing DINOv2's limitations, its impact, and future research directions.

- **Summary**: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.

- **Summary**: Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors. Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000 vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and (3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and beyond.

- **Summary**: The integration of Diffusion Models into Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is a substantial improvement in the detection of accidents. We present a novel hybrid model integrating guidance classification with diffusion techniques. By leveraging fine-tuned ExceptionNet architecture outputs as input for our proposed diffusion model and processing image tensors as our conditioning, our approach creates a robust classification framework. Our model consists of multiple conditional modules, which aim to modulate the linear projection of inputs using time embeddings and image covariate embeddings, allowing the network to adapt its behavior dynamically throughout the diffusion process. To address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models, our implementation is cloud-based, enabling scalable and efficient processing. Our strategy overcomes the shortcomings of conventional classification approaches by leveraging diffusion models inherent capacity to effectively understand complicated data distributions. We investigate important diffusion characteristics, such as timestep schedulers, timestep encoding techniques, timestep count, and architectural design changes, using a thorough ablation study, and have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model against the baseline models on a publicly available dataset. The proposed diffusion model performs best in image-based accident detection with an accuracy of 97.32%.

- **Summary**: Brain stimulation is a powerful tool for understanding cortical function and holds promise for therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. Initial visual prosthetics apply electric microstimulation to early visual cortex which can evoke percepts of simple symbols such as letters. However, these approaches are fundamentally limited by hardware constraints and the low-level representational properties of this cortical region. In contrast, higher-level visual areas encode more complex object representations and therefore constitute a promising target for stimulation - but determining representational targets that reliably evoke object-level percepts constitutes a major challenge. We here introduce a computational framework to causally model and guide stimulation of high-level cortex, comprising three key components: (1) a perturbation module that translates microstimulation parameters into spatial changes to neural activity, (2) topographic models that capture the spatial organization of cortical neurons and thus enable prototyping of stimulation experiments, and (3) a mapping procedure that links model-optimized stimulation sites back to primate cortex. Applying this framework in two macaque monkeys performing a visual recognition task, model-predicted stimulation experiments produced significant in-vivo changes in perceptual choices. Per-site model predictions and monkey behavior were strongly correlated, underscoring the promise of model-guided stimulation. Image generation further revealed a qualitative similarity between in-silico stimulation of face-selective sites and a patient's report of facephenes. This proof-of-principle establishes a foundation for model-guided microstimulation and points toward next-generation visual prosthetics capable of inducing more complex visual experiences.

- **Summary**: RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment attractive objects by combining RGB and thermal infrared images. To enhance performance, the Segment Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high- and low- activations are ignored, thereby leaving room for further performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Fundamental experiments on RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on scribble supervised RGB-T SOD, fully supervised RGB-D SOD datasets and full-supervised RGB-D rail surface defect detection all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to localize the target object described by a natural language expression. Recent advances in vision-language learning have led to significant performance improvements in REC tasks. However, localizing extremely small objects remains a considerable challenge despite its importance in real-world applications such as autonomous driving. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset and method for REC targeting small objects. First, we present the small object REC (SOREC) dataset, which consists of 100,000 pairs of referring expressions and corresponding bounding boxes for small objects in driving scenarios. Second, we propose the progressive-iterative zooming adapter (PIZA), an adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the SOREC dataset. Our dataset, codes and pre-trained models are publicly available on the project page.

- **Summary**: We introduce EmbodiSwap - a method for producing photorealistic synthetic robot overlays over human video. We employ EmbodiSwap for zero-shot imitation learning, bridging the embodiment gap between in-the-wild ego-centric human video and a target robot embodiment. We train a closed-loop robot manipulation policy over the data produced by EmbodiSwap. We make novel use of V-JEPA as a visual backbone, repurposing V-JEPA from the domain of video understanding to imitation learning over synthetic robot videos. Adoption of V-JEPA outperforms alternative vision backbones more conventionally used within robotics. In real-world tests, our zero-shot trained V-JEPA model achieves an $82\%$ success rate, outperforming a few-shot trained $\pi_0$ network as well as $\pi_0$ trained over data produced by EmbodiSwap. We release (i) code for generating the synthetic robot overlays which takes as input human videos and an arbitrary robot URDF and generates a robot dataset, (ii) the robot dataset we synthesize over EPIC-Kitchens, HOI4D and Ego4D, and (iii) model checkpoints and inference code, to facilitate reproducible research and broader adoption.

- **Summary**: Segmenting of clinically important retinal blood vessels into arteries and veins is a prerequisite for retinal vessel analysis. Such analysis can provide potential insights and bio-markers for identifying and diagnosing various retinal eye diseases. Alteration in the regularity and width of the retinal blood vessels can act as an indicator of the health of the vasculature system all over the body. It can help identify patients at high risk of developing vasculature diseases like stroke and myocardial infarction. Over the years, various Deep Learning architectures have been proposed to perform retinal vessel segmentation. Recently, attention mechanisms have been increasingly used in image segmentation tasks. The work proposes a new Deep Learning approach for artery-vein segmentation. The new approach is based on the Attention mechanism that is incorporated into the WNet Deep Learning model, and we call the model as Attention-WNet. The proposed approach has been tested on publicly available datasets such as HRF and DRIVE datasets. The proposed approach has outperformed other state-of-art models available in the literature.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset composition and downstream model bias.

- **Summary**: While deep learning methods for detecting informal settlements have already been developed, they have not yet fully utilized the potential offered by recent pretrained neural networks. We compare two types of pretrained neural networks for detecting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: 1. Generic networks pretrained on large diverse datasets of unspecific images, 2. A specialized network pretrained on satellite imagery. While the latter is more specific to the target task, the former has been pretrained on significantly more images. Hence, this research investigates whether task specificity or data volume yields superior performance in urban informal settlement detection.

- **Summary**: Humans understand the world through the integration of multiple sensory modalities, enabling them to perceive, reason about, and imagine dynamic physical processes. Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and generation. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world models. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual reasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information, control generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We investigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation models and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of MFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning skills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal reasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand deeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore generative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and video modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable generation. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning, and multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring consistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent. We further extend these techniques to controllable 4D generation, enabling interactive, editable, and morphable object synthesis over time and space.

- **Summary**: Deepfakes pose significant societal risks, motivating the development of proactive defenses that embed adversarial perturbations in facial images to prevent manipulation. However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug-and-play LoRA patch into Deepfake generators to bypass state-of-the-art defenses. A learnable gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses. These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies.

- **Summary**: Given a query image, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is the task of retrieving an image of the same place from a reference database with robustness to viewpoint and appearance changes. Recent works show that some VPR benchmarks are solved by methods using Vision-Foundation-Model backbones and trained on large-scale and diverse VPR-specific datasets. Several benchmarks remain challenging, particularly when the test environments differ significantly from the usual VPR training datasets. We propose a complementary, unexplored source of information to bridge the train-test domain gap, which can further improve the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) VPR methods on such challenging benchmarks. Concretely, we identify that the test-time reference set, the "map", contains images and poses of the target domain, and must be available before the test-time query is received in several VPR applications. Therefore, we propose to perform simple Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF) of VPR models on the map, boosting the SOTA (~2.3% increase on average for Recall@1) on these challenging datasets. Finetuned models retain generalization, and RSF works across diverse test datasets.

- **Summary**: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization but doubles the computational cost of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by requiring twice the gradient calculations per optimization step. To mitigate this, we propose Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization) without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The code is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/ajiaaa/ARSAM.

- **Summary**: The transparency of deep learning models is essential for clinical diagnostics. Concept Bottleneck Model provides clear decision-making processes for diagnosis by transforming the latent space of black-box models into human-understandable concepts. However, concept-based methods still face challenges in concept capture capabilities. These methods often rely on encode features solely from the final layer, neglecting shallow and multiscale features, and lack effective guidance in concept encoding, hindering fine-grained concept extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Concept Prompting and Aggregating (CoPA), a novel framework designed to capture multilayer concepts under prompt guidance. This framework utilizes the Concept-aware Embedding Generator (CEG) to extract concept representations from each layer of the visual encoder. Simultaneously, these representations serve as prompts for Concept Prompt Tuning (CPT), steering the model towards amplifying critical concept-related visual cues. Visual representations from each layer are aggregated to align with textual concept representations. With the proposed method, valuable concept-wise information in the images is captured and utilized effectively, thus improving the performance of concept and disease prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CoPA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/yihengd/CoPA.

- **Summary**: The increasing size and complexity of medical imaging datasets, particularly in 3D formats, present significant barriers to collaborative research and transferability. This study investigates whether the ZFP compression technique can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a viable and powerful tool for enabling more efficient and accessible research on large-scale medical datasets, fostering broader collaboration across the community.

- **Summary**: In recent years, deep learning has shown near-expert performance in segmenting complex medical tissues and tumors. However, existing models are often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging, particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs, Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support reproducibility and further research.

- **Summary**: Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart city development. Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve 78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score) classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference. However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.

- **Summary**: Unpaired image-to-image translation involves learning mappings between source domain and target domain in the absence of aligned or corresponding samples. Score based diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in generative tasks. Their ability to approximate complex data distributions through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) enables them to generate high-fidelity and diverse outputs, making them particularly well-suited for unpaired I2I settings. In parallel, contrastive learning provides a powerful framework for learning semantic similarities without the need for explicit supervision or paired data. By pulling together representations of semantically similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, contrastive methods are inherently aligned with the objectives of unpaired translation. Its ability to selectively enforce semantic consistency at the feature level makes contrastive learning particularly effective for guiding generation in unpaired scenarios. In this work, we propose a time-dependent contrastive learning approach where a model is trained with SimCLR by considering an image and its domain invarient feature as a positive pair, enabling the preservation of domain-invariant features and the discarding of domain-specific ones. The learned contrastive model then guides the inference of a pretrained SDE for the I2I translation task. We empirically compare Contrastive-SDE with several baselines across three common unpaired I2I tasks, using four metrics for evaluation. Constrastive-SDE achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art on several metrics. Furthermore, we observe that our model converges significantly faster and requires no label supervision or classifier training, making it a more efficient alternative for this task.

- **Summary**: LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization and comprehension.

- **Summary**: Continuous space-time video super-resolution (C-STVSR) has garnered increasing interest for its capability to reconstruct high-resolution and high-frame-rate videos at arbitrary spatial and temporal scales. However, prevailing methods often generalize poorly, producing unsatisfactory results when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) scales. To overcome this limitation, we present EvEnhancer, a novel approach that marries the unique properties of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range encapsulated in event streams to achieve robust and generalizable C-STVSR. Our approach incorporates event-adapted synthesis that capitalizes on the spatiotemporal correlations between frames and events to capture long-term motion trajectories, enabling adaptive interpolation and fusion across space and time. This is then coupled with a local implicit video transformer that integrates local implicit video neural function with cross-scale spatiotemporal attention to learn continuous video representations and generate plausible videos at arbitrary resolutions and frame rates. We further develop EvEnhancerPlus, which builds a controllable switching mechanism that dynamically determines the reconstruction difficulty for each spatiotemporal pixel based on local event statistics. This allows the model to adaptively route reconstruction along the most suitable pathways at a fine-grained pixel level, substantially reducing computational overhead while maintaining excellent performance. Furthermore, we devise a cross-derivative training strategy that stabilizes the convergence of such a multi-pathway framework through staged cross-optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, while maintaining superior generalizability at OOD scales.

- **Summary**: We propose a simple, data-efficient pipeline that augments an implicit reconstruction network based on neural SDF-based CAD parts with a part-segmentation head trained under PartField-generated supervision. Unlike methods tied to fixed taxonomies, our model accepts meshes with any number of parts and produces coherent, geometry-aligned labels in a single pass. We evaluate on randomly sampled CAD meshes from the ABC dataset with intentionally varied part cardinalities, including over-segmented shapes, and report strong performance across reconstruction (CDL1/CDL2, F1-micro, NC) and segmentation (mIoU, Accuracy), together with a new Segmentation Consistency metric that captures local label smoothness. We attach a lightweight segmentation head to the Flat-CAD SDF trunk; on a paired evaluation it does not alter reconstruction while providing accurate part labels for meshes with any number of parts. Even under degraded reconstructions on thin or intricate geometries, segmentation remains accurate and label-coherent, often preserving the correct part count. Our approach therefore offers a practical route to semantically structured CAD meshes without requiring curated taxonomies or exact palette matches. We discuss limitations in boundary precision, partly due to per-face supervision, and outline paths toward boundary-aware training and higher resolution labels.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in image generation models have led to models that produce synthetic images that are increasingly difficult for standard AI detectors to identify, even though they often remain distinguishable by humans. To identify this discrepancy, we introduce \textbf{Mirage}, a curated dataset comprising a diverse range of AI-generated images exhibiting visible artifacts, where current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.

- **Summary**: We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{<SEG>} as prompt''. UGround addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues (\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer, MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise (empty target).

- **Summary**: Background: Pleural Effusions (PE) is a common finding in many different clinical conditions, but accurately measuring their volume from CT scans is challenging. Purpose: To improve PE segmentation and quantification for enhanced clinical management, we have developed and trained a semi-supervised deep learning framework on contrast-enhanced CT volumes. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study collected CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) data from internal and external datasets. A subset of 100 cases was manually annotated for model training, while the remaining cases were used for testing and validation. A novel semi-supervised deep learning framework, Teacher-Teaching Assistant-Student (TTAS), was developed and used to enable efficient training in non-segmented examinations. Segmentation performance was compared to that of state-of-the-art models. Results: 100 patients (mean age, 72 years, 28 [standard deviation]; 55 men) were included in the study. The TTAS model demonstrated superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving a mean Dice score of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79 - 0.84) versus 0.73 for nnU-Net (p < 0.0001, Student's T test). Additionally, TTAS exhibited a four-fold lower mean Absolute Volume Difference (AbVD) of 6.49 mL (95% CI, 4.80 - 8.20) compared to nnU-Net's AbVD of 23.16 mL (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The developed TTAS framework offered superior PE segmentation, aiding accurate volume determination from CT scans.

- **Summary**: 4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions. However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations, further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new possibilities for a wide range of applications.

- **Summary**: Traditional object detection models are typically trained on a fixed set of classes, limiting their flexibility and making it costly to incorporate new categories. Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training. Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView, DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach. Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16 mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance, thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in aerial applications.

- **Summary**: Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer worldwide, which highlights the critical importance of early detection and diagnosis in improving patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) has shown significant promise in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of automated skin disease diagnosis, particularly in detecting and evaluating skin lesions and classification. However, there are still several challenges for DL-based skin cancer diagnosis, including complex features, image noise, intra-class variation, inter-class similarity, and data imbalance. By synthesizing recent research, this review discusses innovative approaches to cope with these challenges, such as data augmentation, hybrid models, and feature fusion, etc. Furthermore, the review highlights the integration of DL models into clinical workflows, offering insights into the potential of deep learning to revolutionize skin disease diagnosis and improve clinical decision-making. This article follows a comprehensive methodology based on the PRISMA framework and emphasizes the need for continued advancements to fully unlock the transformative potential of DL in dermatological care.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieve excellent performance in generative tasks, such as image super-resolution, but their computational requirements make difficult their deployment on resource-constrained devices. While knowledge distillation is a promising research direction for GAN compression, effectively training a smaller student generator is challenging due to the capacity mismatch between the student generator and the teacher discriminator. In this work, we propose Student Discriminator Assisted Knowledge Distillation (SDAKD), a novel GAN distillation methodology that introduces a student discriminator to mitigate this capacity mismatch. SDAKD follows a three-stage training strategy, and integrates an adapted feature map distillation approach in its last two training stages. We evaluated SDAKD on two well-performing super-resolution GANs, GCFSR and Real-ESRGAN. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over the baselines and SOTA GAN knowledge distillation methods. The SDAKD source code will be made openly available upon acceptance of the paper.

- **Summary**: Diagnosing ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) requires a comprehensive analysis of both head pose and ocular movements. However, existing datasets focus on these aspects separately, limiting the development of integrated diagnostic approaches and restricting AI-driven advancements in AHP analysis. To address this gap, we introduce PoseGaze-AHP, a novel 3D dataset that synchronously captures head pose and gaze movement information for ocular-induced AHP assessment. Structured clinical data were extracted from medical literature using large language models (LLMs) through an iterative process with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, combining stepwise, hierarchical, and complex prompting strategies. The extracted records were systematically imputed and transformed into 3D representations using the Neural Head Avatar (NHA) framework. The dataset includes 7,920 images generated from two head textures, covering a broad spectrum of ocular conditions. The extraction method achieved an overall accuracy of 91.92%, demonstrating its reliability for clinical dataset construction. PoseGaze-AHP is the first publicly available resource tailored for AI-driven ocular-induced AHP diagnosis, supporting the development of accurate and privacy-compliant diagnostic tools.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of 3D scanning and reconstruction technologies, dynamic digital human avatars based on 4D meshes have become increasingly popular. A high-precision dynamic digital human avatar can be applied to various fields such as game production, animation generation, and remote immersive communication. However, these 4D human avatar meshes are prone to being degraded by various types of noise during the processes of collection, compression, and transmission, thereby affecting the viewing experience of users. In light of this fact, quality assessment of dynamic 4D digital humans becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale dynamic digital human quality assessment dataset, DHQA-4D, which contains 32 high-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D human meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their corresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs). Equipped with DHQA-4D dataset, we analyze the influence of different types of distortion on human perception for textured dynamic 4D meshes and non-textured dynamic 4D meshes. Additionally, we propose DynaMesh-Rater, a novel large multimodal model (LMM) based approach that is able to assess both textured 4D meshes and non-textured 4D meshes. Concretely, DynaMesh-Rater elaborately extracts multi-dimensional features, including visual features from a projected 2D video, motion features from cropped video clips, and geometry features from the 4D human mesh to provide comprehensive quality-related information. Then we utilize a LMM model to integrate the multi-dimensional features and conduct a LoRA-based instruction tuning technique to teach the LMM model to predict the quality scores. Extensive experimental results on the DHQA-4D dataset demonstrate the superiority of our DynaMesh-Rater method over previous quality assessment methods.

- **Summary**: Skin cancer classification remains a challenging problem due to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and image noise in dermoscopic images. To address these issues, we propose an improved ResNet-50 model enhanced with Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF), which adaptively integrates multi-scale semantic and surface features to improve feature representation and reduce overfitting. The ResNet-50 model is enhanced with an adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve more effective multi-scale feature extraction and improve overall performance. Specifically, a dual-branch design fuses high-level semantic and mid-level detail features, which are processed through global average pooling and fully connected layers to generate adaptive weights for weighted fusion, thereby strengthening feature learning and reducing the impact of noise on classification. The method is evaluated on a subset of the ISIC 2020 dataset containing 3297 benign and malignant skin lesion images. Experimental results show that the proposed ASFF-based ResNet-50 achieves the best overall performance compared with 5 classic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models. The proposed model reached an accuracy of 93.18% along with higher precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The improved model achieves an AUC value of 0.9670 and 0.9717 in the P-R and ROC curve, respectively. Then, the evaluation based on Grad-CAM further proved that the improved model adaptively focuses on lesion-relevant regions while suppressing irrelevant background information, thereby validating its enhanced feature learning capability from a deep representation perspective. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a more effective and efficient solution for computer-aided skin cancer diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Aims Late diagnosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) contributes significantly to its high global mortality rate, with over 50\% of cases detected at advanced stages and a 5-year survival rate below 50\% according to WHO statistics. This study aims to improve early detection of OSCC by developing a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates clinical, radiological, and histopathological images using a weighted ensemble of DenseNet-121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Material and Methods A retrospective study was conducted using publicly available datasets representing three distinct medical imaging modalities. Each modality-specific dataset was used to train a DenseNet-121 CNN via transfer learning. Augmentation and modality-specific preprocessing were applied to increase robustness. Predictions were fused using a validation-weighted ensemble strategy. Evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. Results High validation accuracy was achieved for radiological (100\%) and histopathological (95.12\%) modalities, with clinical images performing lower (63.10\%) due to visual heterogeneity. The ensemble model demonstrated improved diagnostic robustness with an overall accuracy of 84.58\% on a multimodal validation dataset of 55 samples. Conclusion The multimodal ensemble framework bridges gaps in the current diagnostic workflow by offering a non-invasive, AI-assisted triage tool that enhances early identification of high-risk lesions. It supports clinicians in decision-making, aligning with global oncology guidelines to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes.

- **Summary**: In recent years, with the rapid development of powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs), explainable image quality assessment (IQA) has gradually become popular, aiming at providing quality-related descriptions and answers of images. To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a large-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality perception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large amount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and redundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model. To cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and systematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning dataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first investigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different sizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data set randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than training with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the redundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly sampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with three stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and cluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each stage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for explainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can achieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10% selected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing computational costs while achieving better performance.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment, most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.

- **Summary**: Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture, generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data. While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from "acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible. Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on vision-language reasoning tasks. However, their potential for zero-shot fine-grained image classification, a challenging task requiring precise differentiation between visually similar categories, remains underexplored. We present a novel method that transforms zero-shot fine-grained image classification into a visual question-answering framework, leveraging LVLMs' comprehensive understanding capabilities rather than relying on direct class name generation. We enhance model performance through a novel attention intervention technique. We also address a key limitation in existing datasets by developing more comprehensive and precise class description benchmarks. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation across multiple fine-grained image classification benchmarks. Our proposed method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our method and the broader potential of LVLMs for zero-shot fine-grained classification tasks.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants (filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images. Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves autonomous perception in adverse weather.

- **Summary**: Human video generation is becoming an increasingly important task with broad applications in graphics, entertainment, and embodied AI. Despite the rapid progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation. It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs, mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions, conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use cases.

- **Summary**: World-scale augmented reality (AR) applications need a ubiquitous 6DoF localization backend to anchor content to the real world consistently across devices. Large organizations such as Google and Niantic are 3D scanning outdoor public spaces in order to build their own Visual Positioning Systems (VPS). These centralized VPS solutions fail to meet the needs of many future AR applications -- they do not cover private indoor spaces because of privacy concerns, regulations, and the labor bottleneck of updating and maintaining 3D scans. In this paper, we present OpenFLAME, a federated VPS backend that allows independent organizations to 3D scan and maintain a separate VPS service for their own spaces. This enables access control of indoor 3D scans, distributed maintenance of the VPS backend, and encourages larger coverage. Sharding of VPS services introduces several unique challenges -- coherency of localization results across spaces, quality control of VPS services, selection of the right VPS service for a location, and many others. We introduce the concept of federated image-based localization and provide reference solutions for managing and merging data across maps without sharing private data.

- **Summary**: Automated tennis stroke analysis has advanced significantly with the integration of biomechanical motion cues alongside deep learning techniques, enhancing stroke classification accuracy and player performance evaluation. Despite these advancements, existing systems often fail to connect biomechanical insights with actionable language feedback that is both accessible and meaningful to players and coaches. This research project addresses this gap by developing a novel framework that extracts key biomechanical features (such as joint angles, limb velocities, and kinetic chain patterns) from motion data using Convolutional Neural Network Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)-based models. These features are analyzed for relationships influencing stroke effectiveness and injury risk, forming the basis for feedback generation using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the THETIS dataset and feature extraction techniques, our approach aims to produce feedback that is technically accurate, biomechanically grounded, and actionable for end-users. The experimental setup evaluates this framework on classification performance and interpretability, bridging the gap between explainable AI and sports biomechanics.

- **Summary**: To manage the complexity of transformers in video compression, local attention mechanisms are a practical necessity. The common approach of partitioning frames into patches, however, creates architectural flaws like irregular receptive fields. When adapted for temporal autoregressive models, this paradigm, exemplified by the Video Compression Transformer (VCT), also necessitates computationally redundant overlapping windows. This work introduces 3D Sliding Window Attention (SWA), a patchless form of local attention. By enabling a decoder-only architecture that unifies spatial and temporal context processing, and by providing a uniform receptive field, our method significantly improves rate-distortion performance, achieving Bj{\o}rntegaard Delta-rate savings of up to 18.6 % against the VCT baseline. Simultaneously, by eliminating the need for overlapping windows, our method reduces overall decoder complexity by a factor of 2.8, while its entropy model is nearly 3.5 times more efficient. We further analyze our model's behavior and show that while it benefits from long-range temporal context, excessive context can degrade performance.

- **Summary**: Image projection systems must be efficient in data storage, computation and transmission while maintaining a large space-bandwidth-product (SBP) at their output. Here, we introduce a hybrid image projection system that achieves extended depth-of-field (DOF) with improved resolution, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based digital encoder with an all-optical diffractive decoder. A CNN-based encoder compresses input images into compact phase representations, which are subsequently displayed by a low-resolution (LR) projector and processed by an analog diffractive decoder for all-optical image reconstruction. This optical decoder is completely passive, designed to synthesize pixel super-resolved image projections that feature an extended DOF while eliminating the need for additional power consumption for super-resolved image reconstruction. Our pixel super-resolution (PSR) image projection system demonstrates high-fidelity image synthesis over an extended DOF of ~267xW, where W is the illumination wavelength, concurrently offering up to ~16-fold SBP improvement at each lateral plane. The proof of concept of this approach is validated through an experiment conducted in the THz spectrum, and the system is scalable across different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This image projection architecture can reduce data storage and transmission requirements for display systems without imposing additional power constraints on the optical decoder. Beyond extended DOF PSR image projection, the underlying principles of this approach can be extended to various applications, including optical metrology and microscopy.

- **Summary**: While Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across general video understanding benchmarks-particularly in video captioning and descriptive tasks-they consistently underperform on tasks that require fine-grained temporal understanding. This limitation arises due to the lack of visual complexity and temporal nuance in current fine-tuning datasets, leading these models to rely heavily on language-based reasoning rather than truly understanding video dynamics. In this work, we propose TimeWarp, a systematic method to create a targeted synthetic temporal dataset to fine-tune the model's responses to encourage it to focus on the given input video. We introduce a large-scale preference dataset, created using TimeWarp, that captures intricate temporal dynamics often overlooked, grounding the model's responses to visual and temporal information. We demonstrate that when our method is applied to existing models, it significantly improves performance on temporal understanding benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed datasets in advancing temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, resulting in an absolute improvement in performance across seven benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Pollinators are critical to the world's ecosystems and food supply, yet recent studies have found pollination shortfalls in several crops, including strawberry. This is troubling because wild and managed pollinators are currently experiencing declines. One possibility is to try and provide supplemental pollination solutions. These solutions should be affordable and simple for farmers to implement if their use is to be widespread; quadcopters are a great example, already used for monitoring on many farms. This paper investigates a new method for artificial pollination based on wind pollination that bears further investigation. After determining the height where the lateral flow is maximized, we performed field experiments with a quadcopter assisting natural pollinators. Although our results in the field were inconclusive, lab studies show that the idea shows promise and could be adapted for better field results.

- **Summary**: Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions. Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance. Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.
