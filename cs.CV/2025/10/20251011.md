- **Summary**: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets, and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

- **Summary**: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves 81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task, outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

- **Summary**: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate, robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset, STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art detection methods.



### J-RAS: Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation via Retrieval-Augmented Joint Training

- **Summary**: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions, is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model. Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of 1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across architectures and datasets.



### Scaling Traffic Insights with AI and Language Model-Powered Camera Systems for Data-Driven Transportation Decision Making

- **Summary**: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

- **Summary**: Perceptual optimization is widely recognized as essential for neural compression, yet balancing the rate-distortion-perception tradeoff remains challenging. This difficulty is especially pronounced in video compression, where frame-wise quality fluctuations often cause perceptually optimized neural video codecs to suffer from flickering artifacts. In this paper, inspired by the success of latent generative models, we present Generative Latent Video Compression (GLVC), an effective framework for perceptual video compression. GLVC employs a pretrained continuous tokenizer to project video frames into a perceptually aligned latent space, thereby offloading perceptual constraints from the rate-distortion optimization. We redesign the codec architecture explicitly for the latent domain, drawing on extensive insights from prior neural video codecs, and further equip it with innovations such as unified intra/inter coding and a recurrent memory mechanism. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that GLVC achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of DISTS and LPIPS metrics. Notably, our user study confirms GLVC rivals the latest neural video codecs at nearly half their rate while maintaining stable temporal coherence, marking a step toward practical perceptual video compression.

- **Summary**: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation, the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both 2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and dataset.



### BurstDeflicker: A Benchmark Dataset for Flicker Removal in Dynamic Scenes

- **Summary**: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting. These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity, area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker removal.

- **Summary**: Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels (DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm: Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity. This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of performance targets.

- **Summary**: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding capabilities, which are not available in previous models.



### Q-Adapter: Visual Query Adapter for Extracting Textually-related Features in Video Captioning

- **Summary**: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning" paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task. Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness, providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning. These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for video-language modeling.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance, especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this, we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to \textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and real-world scenes, respectively.

- **Summary**: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames. Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

- **Summary**: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues. In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising 1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the "think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of medical AI.

- **Summary**: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and other related areas.

- **Summary**: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically, we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

- **Summary**: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words) to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively. Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast, convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper, we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named {\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution) achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention.

- **Summary**: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset. All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents are emerging as powerful tools for automating complex online tasks. However, when deployed in real-world environments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of security evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt manipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \tool{}, the first holistic benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \tool{} first introduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic web environments (\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes 2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The suite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both user-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a multi-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three critical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task outcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple success metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9 representative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose, agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal critical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1) a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered evaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of modern LVLM-based web agents, \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing trustworthy web agent deployment.

- **Summary**: We tackle the challenge of robust, in-the-wild imaging using ultra-thin nanophotonic metalens cameras. Meta-lenses, composed of planar arrays of nanoscale scatterers, promise dramatic reductions in size and weight compared to conventional refractive optics. However, severe chromatic aberration, pronounced light scattering, narrow spectral bandwidth, and low light efficiency continue to limit their practical adoption. In this work, we present an end-to-end solution for in-the-wild imaging that pairs a metalens several times thinner than conventional optics with a bespoke multi-image restoration framework optimized for practical metalens cameras. Our method centers on a lightweight convolutional network paired with a memory-efficient burst fusion algorithm that adaptively corrects noise, saturation clipping, and lens-induced distortions across rapid sequences of extremely degraded metalens captures. Extensive experiments on diverse, real-world handheld captures demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing burst-mode and single-image restoration techniques.These results point toward a practical route for deploying metalens-based cameras in everyday imaging applications.

- **Summary**: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors, enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification. Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided, auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars, capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP) have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative \underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}). Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to baseline methods.

### Answer-Consistent Chain-of-thought Reinforcement Learning For Multi-modal Large Langauge Models

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning (ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check. After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\% and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the GRPO baseline.

- **Summary**: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke detection.

- **Summary**: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations. Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability. Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

- **Summary**: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion, intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture. Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets, containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment. Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust immersive recognition.

- **Summary**: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency, and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

- **Summary**: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently, low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed. According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7 percent according to the validation set.

- **Summary**: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues, three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference. Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline - while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%. Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments, showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view, enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich renderings with precise user control.

- **Summary**: A key challenge in ischemic stroke diagnosis using medical imaging is the accurate localization of the occluded vessel. Current machine learning methods in focus primarily on lesion segmentation, with limited work on vessel localization. In this study, we introduce Stroke Locus Net, an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for detection, segmentation, and occluded vessel localization using only MRI scans. The proposed system combines a segmentation branch using nnUNet for lesion detection with an arterial atlas for vessel mapping and identification, and a generation branch using pGAN to synthesize MRA images from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and more informed stroke diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1) have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts, pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

- **Summary**: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models. The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool, integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality segmentation masks to process their data.

- **Summary**: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual concepts. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/CristianoPatricio/viconex-med.

- **Summary**: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However, current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm. Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets.

- **Summary**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time, high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos. Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320 fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings, environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation, and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8% R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset and method. The code and dataset will be released.

- **Summary**: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment, EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability, robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior after deployment.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained success in various signal processing tasks due to their advantages of continuity and infinite resolution. However, the factors influencing their effectiveness and limitations remain underexplored. To better understand these factors, we leverage insights from Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyze how model architectures (classic MLP and emerging KAN), positional encoding, and nonlinear primitives affect the response to signals of varying frequencies. Building on this analysis, we introduce INR-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for multimodal INR tasks. It includes 56 variants of Coordinate-MLP models (featuring 4 types of positional encoding and 14 activation functions) and 22 Coordinate-KAN models with distinct basis functions, evaluated across 9 implicit multimodal tasks. These tasks cover both forward and inverse problems, offering a robust platform to highlight the strengths and limitations of different neural models, thereby establishing a solid foundation for future research.

- **Summary**: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to ground-truth annotations.   We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2) stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81% overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

- **Summary**: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary relational perception in 3D localization.

- **Summary**: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system, developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5 million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

- **Summary**: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of data-driven autonomous driving systems.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of   AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies}, including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies   is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity assessment. In this paper,   we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC images and   introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}. Annotations are produced by   a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.   At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We further   show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric (\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).   Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary, AnomReason and AnomAgent   serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and interpretable AIGC forensics.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan, producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on 4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation models built on video models.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view synthesis.

- **Summary**: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective training across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment, heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich, diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity. Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B instantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep of benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities, from flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments, and tasks.

- **Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic, two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2 leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations, even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic, reconnaissance-based attacks.

- **Summary**: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2 features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more reliable perception for autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however, fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets, SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation, respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

- **Summary**: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet scenes.

- **Summary**: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7 percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

- **Summary**: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\% inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\% reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of AI-driven monitoring systems.

- **Summary**: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However, existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud completion.
