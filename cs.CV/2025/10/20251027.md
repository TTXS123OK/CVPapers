- **Summary**: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm * 30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors (AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual, spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in a Kaggle competition that challenges the international Machine Learning community with the task of pasture biomass estimation. The dataset is available on the official Kaggle webpage: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/csiro-biomass

- **Summary**: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments. State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat, that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive 3D AI applications.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding (\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM reasoning.

- **Summary**: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend this work to other biometrics in the future.

- **Summary**: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes, such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

- **Summary**: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and (2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

- **Summary**: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME} for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings. Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing VE baselines.

- **Summary**: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks. Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping, agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.



### VALA: Learning Latent Anchors for Training-Free and Temporally Consistent

- **Summary**: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments, VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective. Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over prior methods.



### Scaling Up Occupancy-centric Driving Scene Generation: Dataset and Method

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving, enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation. Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark. Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation, and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value in downstream tasks.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases, and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in accuracy and speed.



### Exploring Semantic-constrained Adversarial Example with Instruction Uncertainty Reduction

- **Summary**: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues, this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction (InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable, adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method, we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler, therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation, we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial examples for the first time.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities, offering real-time, radiation-free assessment across diverse clinical domains. However, interpretation of ultrasound images remains challenging due to high noise levels, operator dependence, and limited field of view, resulting in substantial inter-observer variability. Current Deep Learning approaches are hindered by the scarcity of large labeled datasets and the domain gap between general and sonographic images, which limits the transferability of models pretrained on non-medical data. To address these challenges, we introduce the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), the first large-scale self-supervised MAE framework pretrained exclusively on ultrasound data. The model was pre-trained on 370,000 2D and 3D ultrasound images curated from 46 open-source datasets, collectively termed OpenUS-46, spanning over twenty anatomical regions. This curated dataset has been made publicly available to facilitate further research and reproducibility. Using a Vision Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, USF-MAE reconstructs masked image patches, enabling it to learn rich, modality-specific representations directly from unlabeled data. The pretrained encoder was fine-tuned on three public downstream classification benchmarks: BUS-BRA (breast cancer), MMOTU-2D (ovarian tumors), and GIST514-DB (gastrointestinal stromal tumors). Across all tasks, USF-MAE consistently outperformed conventional CNN and ViT baselines, achieving F1-scores of 81.6%, 79.6%, and 82.4%, respectively. Despite not using labels during pretraining, USF-MAE approached the performance of the supervised foundation model UltraSam on breast cancer classification and surpassed it on the other tasks, demonstrating strong cross-anatomical generalization.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images. While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and (ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a ``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator, highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films, and games.



### LoMix: Learnable Weighted Multi-Scale Logits Mixing for Medical Image Segmentation

- **Summary**: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final, highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations. Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication, concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales, mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures (i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency. Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully interpretable, and overhead-free at inference.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces an intelligent water-saving irrigation system designed to address critical challenges in precision agriculture, such as inefficient water use and poor terrain adaptability. The system integrates advanced computer vision, robotic control, and real-time stabilization technologies via a multi-sensor fusion approach. A lightweight YOLO model, deployed on an embedded vision processor (K210), enables real-time plant container detection with over 96% accuracy under varying lighting conditions. A simplified hand-eye calibration algorithm-designed for 'handheld camera' robot arm configurations-ensures that the end effector can be precisely positioned, with a success rate exceeding 90%. The active leveling system, driven by the STM32F103ZET6 main control chip and JY901S inertial measurement data, can stabilize the irrigation platform on slopes up to 10 degrees, with a response time of 1.8 seconds. Experimental results across three simulated agricultural environments (standard greenhouse, hilly terrain, complex lighting) demonstrate a 30-50% reduction in water consumption compared to conventional flood irrigation, with water use efficiency exceeding 92% in all test cases.

- **Summary**: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for $\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation, enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video. CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second, in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video generation.

- **Summary**: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs; however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement (PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions. UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets: 8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29), UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with 56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it improved perceptual quality significantly.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale, multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark. Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made publicly available after the paper is accepted.}

- **Summary**: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide a robust foundation for future research.

- **Summary**: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However, their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model, which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

- **Summary**: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP) blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long, untrimmed videos.

- **Summary**: We present Seq-DeepIPC, a sequential end-to-end perception-to-control model for legged robot navigation in realworld environments. Seq-DeepIPC advances intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion and control. The model jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, giving richer spatial features for planning and control. For efficient deployment on edge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while maintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy IMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS positions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both road and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative and ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control in our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves competitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only heading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas. Overall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to more versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we will release the codes to our GitHub repository at https://github.com/oskarnatan/Seq-DeepIPC.

- **Summary**: Deep learning based deformable registration methods have become popular in recent years. However, their ability to generalize beyond training data distribution can be poor, significantly hindering their usability. LUMIR brain registration challenge for Learn2Reg 2025 aims to advance the field by evaluating the performance of the registration on contrasts and modalities different from those included in the training set. Here we describe our submission to the challenge, which proposes a very simple idea for significantly improving robustness by transforming the images into MIND feature space before feeding them into the model. In addition, a special ensembling strategy is proposed that shows a small but consistent improvement.

- **Summary**: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However, endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most 3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing 3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the 3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual accuracy compared to the baseline method.

- **Summary**: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal understanding. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/JJJYmmm/Multimodal-RoPEs.

- **Summary**: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides, they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks.

- **Summary**: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

- **Summary**: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific fusion by 6% in R^2 and 2% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and weights will be released under a permissive license.

- **Summary**: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so, reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks. DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of the salinity variance.

- **Summary**: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares (TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which, although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion, provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects. However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection (DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object. Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\% in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection Score (NDS).

- **Summary**: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work, we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in 3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism. Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in complex industrial scenes.

- **Summary**: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies. In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from 3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in trajectory and waypoint transfer.

- **Summary**: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating VLMs is publicly available at: https://github.com/pascalbenschopTU/VLLM_AnomalyRecognition

- **Summary**: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders, class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii) halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge.

- **Summary**: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints, enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

- **Summary**: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1) mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination, and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence, and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology.

- **Summary**: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF, DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake, referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques. Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods, intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

- **Summary**: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing. A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones. Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the textual prompt, improving content adherence.

  Resource-Efficient Curriculum Learning for Dense Prediction Tasks"

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably, across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

- **Summary**: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering (VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors.

- **Summary**: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes. Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often overlook.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom.

- **Summary**: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions. Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0 and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image scenarios.

- **Summary**: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors (e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components: modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of 9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios, respectively.

- **Summary**: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both global structure and local details.Project page: https://jiahao620.github.io/reconviagen.

- **Summary**: This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis: the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations, presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep learning in medical imaging.   Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain adaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image datasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic input-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and integration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex 3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.   Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in medical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing the model's interpretative abilities. This approach is validated through rigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset, demonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features applicable to various downstream tasks.   In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image analysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on labeled data. It paves the way for more accurate, efficient diagnostic tools in healthcare, signifying a major step forward in the application of deep learning in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Medical image analysis is central to drug discovery and preclinical evaluation, where scalable, objective readouts can accelerate decision-making. We address classification of paclitaxel (Taxol) exposure from phase-contrast microscopy of C6 glioma cells -- a task with subtle dose differences that challenges full-image models. We propose a simple tiling-and-aggregation pipeline that operates on local patches and combines tile outputs into an image label, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the benchmark dataset and improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance model interpretability and point toward robustness-oriented directions for future medical image research.

- **Summary**: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short- and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations, each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at https://github.com/HengLan/PlanarTrack

- **Summary**: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models, especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB) and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution, yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1: 0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision agriculture.

- **Summary**: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples. (1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically, we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at https://github.com/ldong1111/VideoTG-R1.

- **Summary**: The project has carried out the re-optimization of image coloring in accordance with the existing Autocolorization direction model DDColor. For the experiments on the existing weights of DDColor, we found that it has limitations in some frequency bands and the color cast problem caused by insufficient input dimension. We construct two optimization schemes and combine them, which achieves the performance improvement of indicators such as PSNR and SSIM of the images after DDColor.

- **Summary**: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples, enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and innovation in point cloud learning.

- **Summary**: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms. It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

- **Summary**: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic city monitoring.

- **Summary**: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up, geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs, and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details. Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling: sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task. Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the reconstruction process.

- **Summary**: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques, leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However, the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples, enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50. Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%, 80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

- **Summary**: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain \textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and +2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation.

- **Summary**: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance, where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation: We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image, video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker, which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability. Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions, they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable, limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments. Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12 infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection environment.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality. To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency, surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in classification and MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention, indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at enhancing representation quality.

- **Summary**: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric video relighting.

- **Summary**: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end, VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a text-only teacher.

- **Summary**: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages, including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac, exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods. Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification, particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships among visual entities.

- **Summary**: Despite their mechanical sophistication, surgical robots remain blind to their surroundings. This lack of spatial awareness causes collisions, system recoveries, and workflow disruptions, issues that will intensify with the introduction of distributed robots with independent interacting arms. Existing tracking systems rely on bulky infrared cameras and reflective markers, providing only limited views of the surgical scene and adding hardware burden in crowded operating rooms. We present a marker-free proprioception method that enables precise localisation of surgical robots under their sterile draping despite associated obstruction of visual cues. Our method solely relies on lightweight stereo-RGB cameras and novel transformer-based deep learning models. It builds on the largest multi-centre spatial robotic surgery dataset to date (1.4M self-annotated images from human cadaveric and preclinical in vivo studies). By tracking the entire robot and surgical scene, rather than individual markers, our approach provides a holistic view robust to occlusions, supporting surgical scene understanding and context-aware control. We demonstrate an example of potential clinical benefits during in vivo breathing compensation with access to tissue dynamics, unobservable under state of the art tracking, and accurately locate in multi-robot systems for future intelligent interaction. In addition, and compared with existing systems, our method eliminates markers and improves tracking visibility by 25%. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of marker-free proprioception for fully draped surgical robots, reducing setup complexity, enhancing safety, and paving the way toward modular and autonomous robotic surgery.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs, no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However, we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

- **Summary**: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However, progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data, a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions, visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models. Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model, trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5 languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for translating text directly from images.

- **Summary**: First Order Motion Model is a generative model that animates human heads based on very little motion information derived from keypoints. It is a promising solution for video communication because first it operates at very low bitrate and second its computational complexity is moderate compared to other learning based video codecs. However, it has strong limitations by design. Since it generates facial animations by warping source-images, it fails to recreate videos with strong head movements. This works concentrates on one specific kind of head movements, namely head rotations. We show that replacing the Jacobian transformations in FOMM by a global rotation helps the system to perform better on items with head-rotations while saving 40% to 80% of bitrate on P-frames. Moreover, we apply state-of-the-art normalization techniques to the discriminator to stabilize the adversarial training which is essential for generating visually appealing videos. We evaluate the performance by the learned metics LPIPS and DISTS to show the success our optimizations.

- **Summary**: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M, a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained spatio-temporal localization tasks.

- **Summary**: The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments. As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify, since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts. Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup, resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's robotics landscape.

- **Summary**: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation, starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters. Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills: low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban. Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world uncertainties.

- **Summary**: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization, identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal conditioning across several different architectures.

- **Summary**: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive (AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

- **Summary**: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from 386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics. To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on vision-language tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain sometimes unreliable. We introduce PRISM-Bench, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error, models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper, we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

- **Summary**: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism, efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE (Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation. It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified. Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed, such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with 2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation, in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7% mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.
