- **Summary**: As we deploy machine learning systems in the real world, a core challenge is to maintain a model that is performant even as the data shifts. Such shifts can take many forms: new classes may emerge that were absent during training, a problem known as open-set recognition, and the distribution of known categories may change. Guarantees on open-set recognition are mostly derived under the assumption that the distribution of known classes, which we call \emph{the background distribution}, is fixed. In this paper we develop \ours{}, a method that is guaranteed to solve open-set recognition even in the challenging case where the background distribution shifts. We prove that the method works under benign assumptions that the novel class is separable from the non-novel classes, and provide theoretical guarantees that it outperforms a representative baseline in a simplified overparameterized setting. We develop techniques to make \ours{} scalable and robust, and perform comprehensive empirical evaluations on image and text data. The results show that \ours{} significantly outperforms existing open-set recognition methods under background shift. Moreover, we provide new insights into how factors such as the size of the novel class influences performance, an aspect that has not been extensively explored in prior work.

- **Summary**: Adversarially guided diffusion sampling often achieves the target class, but sample quality degrades as deviations between the adversarially controlled and nominal trajectories accumulate. We formalize this degradation as a path-space Kullback-Leibler divergence(path-KL) between controlled and nominal (uncontrolled) diffusion processes, thereby showing via Girsanov's theorem that it exactly equals the control energy. Building on this stochastic optimal control (SOC) view, we theoretically establish that minimizing this path-KL simultaneously tightens upper bounds on both the 2-Wasserstein distance and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), revealing a principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity. From a variational perspective, we derive a first-order optimality condition for the control: among all directions that yield the same classification gain, the component tangent to iso-(log-)density surfaces (i.e., orthogonal to the score) minimizes path-KL, whereas the normal component directly increases distributional drift. This leads to DPAC (Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control), a diffusion guidance rule that projects adversarial gradients onto the tangent space defined by the generative score geometry. We further show that in discrete solvers, the tangent projection cancels the O(Δt) leading error term in the Wasserstein distance, achieving an O(Δt^2) quality gap; moreover, it remains second-order robust to score or metric approximation. Empirical studies on ImageNet-100 validate the theoretical predictions, confirming that DPAC achieves lower FID and estimated path-KL at matched attack success rates.

- **Summary**: Efficient and accurate annotation of datasets remains a significant challenge for deploying object detection models such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional annotation techniques are labor-intensive, requiring extensive manual labeling post data collection. This paper presents a novel real-time annotation approach leveraging YOLO models deployed on edge devices, enabling immediate labeling during image capture. To comprehensively evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed system, we conducted an extensive comparative analysis using three prominent YOLO architectures (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv12) under various configurations: single-class versus multi-class annotation and pretrained versus scratch-based training. Our analysis includes detailed statistical tests and learning dynamics, demonstrating significant advantages of pretrained and single-class configurations in terms of model convergence, performance, and robustness. Results strongly validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our real-time annotation framework, highlighting its capability to drastically reduce dataset preparation time while maintaining high annotation quality.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D object detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in 3D scene understanding. Existing approaches heavily depend on supervised learning with extensive 3D annotations, which are often acquired from LiDAR point clouds through labor-intensive labeling processes. To tackle this problem, we propose VSRD++, a novel weakly supervised framework for monocular 3D object detection that eliminates the reliance on 3D annotations and leverages neural-field-based volumetric rendering with weak 2D supervision. VSRD++ consists of a two-stage pipeline: multi-view 3D autolabeling and subsequent monocular 3D detector training. In the multi-view autolabeling stage, object surfaces are represented as signed distance fields (SDFs) and rendered as instance masks via the proposed instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering. To optimize 3D bounding boxes, we decompose each instance's SDF into a cuboid SDF and a residual distance field (RDF) that captures deviations from the cuboid. To address the geometry inconsistency commonly observed in volume rendering methods applied to dynamic objects, we model the dynamic objects by including velocity into bounding box attributes as well as assigning confidence to each pseudo-label. Moreover, we also employ a 3D attribute initialization module to initialize the dynamic bounding box parameters. In the monocular 3D object detection phase, the optimized 3D bounding boxes serve as pseudo labels for training monocular 3D object detectors. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that VSRD++ significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised approaches for monocular 3D object detection on both static and dynamic scenes.

- **Summary**: Geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs) promise broad generalisation capacity for Earth observation (EO) tasks, particularly under data-limited conditions. However, their large size poses a barrier to deployment on resource-constrained space hardware. To address this, we present compact variants of a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based GeoFM that preserve downstream task performance while enabling onboard execution. Evaluation across five downstream tasks and validation in two representative flight environments show that model compression and domain adaptation are critical to reducing size and resource demands while maintaining high performance under operational conditions. We further demonstrate reliable on-orbit inference with the IMAGIN-e payload aboard the International Space Station. These results establish a pathway from large GeoFMs to flight-ready, resource-efficient deployments, expanding the feasibility of onboard AI for EO missions.



### TabletopGen: Instance-Level Interactive 3D Tabletop Scene Generation from Text or Single Image

- **Summary**: Generating high-fidelity, physically interactive 3D simulated tabletop scenes is essential for embodied AI--especially for robotic manipulation policy learning and data synthesis. However, current text- or image-driven 3D scene generation methods mainly focus on large-scale scenes, struggling to capture the high-density layouts and complex spatial relations that characterize tabletop scenes. To address these challenges, we propose TabletopGen, a training-free, fully automatic framework that generates diverse, instance-level interactive 3D tabletop scenes. TabletopGen accepts a reference image as input, which can be synthesized by a text-to-image model to enhance scene diversity. We then perform instance segmentation and completion on the reference to obtain per-instance images. Each instance is reconstructed into a 3D model followed by canonical coordinate alignment. The aligned 3D models then undergo pose and scale estimation before being assembled into a collision-free, simulation-ready tabletop scene. A key component of our framework is a novel pose and scale alignment approach that decouples the complex spatial reasoning into two stages: a Differentiable Rotation Optimizer for precise rotation recovery and a Top-view Spatial Alignment mechanism for robust translation and scale estimation, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D reference. Extensive experiments and user studies show that TabletopGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, markedly surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility, capable of generating realistic tabletop scenes with rich stylistic and spatial diversity. Our code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: As a variant of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the partial AUC (PAUC) focuses on a specific range of false positive rate (FPR) and/or true positive rate (TPR) in the ROC curve. It is a pivotal evaluation metric in real-world scenarios with both class imbalance and decision constraints. However, selecting instances within these constrained intervals during its calculation is NP-hard, and thus typically requires approximation techniques for practical resolution. Despite the progress made in PAUC optimization over the last few years, most existing methods still suffer from uncontrollable approximation errors or a limited scalability when optimizing the approximate PAUC objectives. In this paper, we close the approximation gap of PAUC optimization by presenting two simple instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with an asymptotically vanishing gap, the other with the unbiasedness at the cost of more variables. Our key idea is to first establish an equivalent instance-wise problem to lower the time complexity, simplify the complicated sample selection procedure by threshold learning, and then apply different smoothing techniques. Equipped with an efficient solver, the resulting algorithms enjoy a linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a convergence rate of $O(ε^{-1/3})$ for typical one-way and two-way PAUCs. Moreover, we provide a tight generalization bound of our minimax reformulations. The result explicitly demonstrates the impact of the TPR/FPR constraints $α$/$β$ on the generalization and exhibits a sharp order of $\tilde{O}(α^{-1}\n_+^{-1} + β^{-1}\n_-^{-1})$. Finally, extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the strength of our proposed methods.

- **Summary**: In the contemporary digital landscape, multi-modal media manipulation has emerged as a significant societal threat, impacting the reliability and integrity of information dissemination. Current detection methodologies in this domain often overlook the crucial aspect of localized information, despite the fact that manipulations frequently occur in specific areas, particularly in facial regions. In response to this critical observation, we propose the M4-BLIP framework. This innovative framework utilizes the BLIP-2 model, renowned for its ability to extract local features, as the cornerstone for feature extraction. Complementing this, we incorporate local facial information as prior knowledge. A specially designed alignment and fusion module within M4-BLIP meticulously integrates these local and global features, creating a harmonious blend that enhances detection accuracy. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly integrates with Large Language Models (LLM), significantly improving the interpretability of the detection outcomes. Extensive quantitative and visualization experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework against the state-of-the-art competitors.

- **Summary**: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) focuses on locating objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions, serving as a fundamental task for embodied AI and robotics. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have motivated research into extending them to 3DVG. However, MLLMs primarily process 2D visual inputs and struggle with understanding 3D spatial structure of scenes solely from these limited perspectives. Existing methods mainly utilize viewpoint-dependent rendering of reconstructed point clouds to provide explicit structural guidance for MLLMs in 3DVG tasks, leading to inefficiency and limited spatial reasoning. To address this issue, we propose S$^2$-MLLM, an efficient framework that enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce a spatial guidance strategy that leverages the structure awareness of feed-forward 3D reconstruction. By acquiring 3D structural understanding during training, our model can implicitly reason about 3D scenes without relying on inefficient point cloud reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a structure-enhanced module (SE), which first employs intra-view and inter-view attention mechanisms to capture dependencies within views and correspondences across views. The module further integrates multi-level position encoding to associate visual representations with spatial positions and viewpoint information, enabling more accurate structural understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S$^2$-MLLM unifies superior performance, generalization, and efficiency, achieving significant performance over existing methods across the ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D datasets. Code will be available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Personalized generation models for a single subject have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness, highlighting their significant potential. However, when extended to multiple subjects, existing models often exhibit degraded performance, particularly in maintaining subject consistency and adhering to textual prompts. We attribute these limitations to the absence of high-quality multi-subject datasets and refined post-training strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable multi-subject data generation pipeline that leverages powerful single-subject generation models to construct diverse and high-quality multi-subject training data. Through this dataset, we first enable single-subject personalization models to acquire knowledge of synthesizing multi-image and multi-subject scenarios. Furthermore, to enhance both subject consistency and text controllability, we design a set of Pairwise Subject-Consistency Rewards and general-purpose rewards, which are incorporated into a refined reinforcement learning stage. To comprehensively evaluate multi-subject personalization, we introduce a new benchmark that assesses model performance using seven subsets across three dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in advancing multi-subject personalized image generation. Github Link: https://github.com/wang-shulei/PSR



### Generative Adversarial Gumbel MCTS for Abstract Visual Composition Generation

- **Summary**: We study abstract visual composition, in which identity is primarily determined by the spatial configuration and relations among a small set of geometric primitives (e.g., parts, symmetry, topology). They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.

- **Summary**: Table recognition (TR) aims to transform table images into semi-structured representations such as HTML or Markdown. As a core component of document parsing, TR has long relied on supervised learning, with recent efforts dominated by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) using labeled data. While VLMs have brought TR to the next level, pushing performance further demands large-scale labeled data that is costly to obtain. Consequently, although proprietary models have continuously pushed the performance boundary, open-source models, often trained with limited resources and, in practice, the only viable option for many due to privacy regulations, still lag far behind. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRivia, a self-supervised fine-tuning method that enables pretrained VLMs to learn TR directly from unlabeled table images in the wild. Built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization, TRivia automatically identifies unlabeled samples that most effectively facilitate learning and eliminates the need for human annotations through a question-answering-based reward mechanism. An attention-guided module generates diverse questions for each table image, and the ability to interpret the recognition results and answer them correctly provides feedback to optimize the TR model. This closed-loop process allows the TR model to autonomously learn to recognize, structure, and reason over tables without labeled data. Leveraging this pipeline, we present TRivia-3B, an open-sourced, compact, and state-of-the-art TR model that surpasses existing systems (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, MinerU2.5) on three popular benchmarks. Model and code are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/TRivia

- **Summary**: Recent efforts on Diffusion Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have primarily focused on developing more sophisticated routing mechanisms. However, we observe that the underlying architectural configuration space remains markedly under-explored. Inspired by the MoE design paradigms established in large language models (LLMs), we identify a set of crucial architectural factors for building effective Diffusion MoE models--including DeepSeek-style expert modules, alternative intermediate widths, varying expert counts, and enhanced attention positional encodings. Our systematic study reveals that carefully tuning these configurations is essential for unlocking the full potential of Diffusion MoE models, often yielding gains that exceed those achieved by routing innovations alone. Through extensive experiments, we present novel architectures that can be efficiently applied to both latent and pixel-space diffusion frameworks, which provide a practical and efficient training recipe that enables Diffusion MoE models to surpass strong baselines while using equal or fewer activated parameters. All code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/yhlleo/EfficientMoE.

- **Summary**: Viscosity measurement is essential for process monitoring and autonomous laboratory operation, yet conventional viscometers remain invasive and require controlled laboratory environments that differ substantially from real process conditions. We present a computer-vision-based viscometer that infers viscosity by exploiting how a fixed background pattern becomes optically distorted as light refracts through the mixing-driven, continuously deforming free surface. Under diverse lighting conditions, the system achieves a mean absolute error of 0.113 in log m2 s^-1 units for regression and reaches up to 81% accuracy in viscosity-class prediction. Although performance declines for classes with closely clustered viscosity values, a multi-pattern strategy improves robustness by providing enriched visual cues. To ensure sensor reliability, we incorporate uncertainty quantification, enabling viscosity predictions with confidence estimates. This stand-off viscometer offers a practical, automation-ready alternative to existing viscometry methods.

- **Summary**: Retinal imaging is a critical, non-invasive modality for the early detection and monitoring of ocular and systemic diseases. Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has significant progress in automated retinal analysis, supporting tasks such as fundus image classification, lesion detection, and vessel segmentation. As a representative lightweight network, nnMobileNet has demonstrated strong performance across multiple retinal benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient. However, purely convolutional architectures inherently struggle to capture long-range dependencies and model the irregular lesions and elongated vascular patterns that characterize on retinal images, despite the critical importance of vascular features for reliable clinical diagnosis. To further advance this line of work and extend the original vision of nnMobileNet, we propose nnMobileNet++, a hybrid architecture that progressively bridges convolutional and transformer representations. The framework integrates three key components: (i) dynamic snake convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, (ii) stage-specific transformer blocks introduced after the second down-sampling stage for global context modeling, and (iii) retinal image pretraining to improve generalization. Experiments on multiple public retinal datasets for classification, together with ablation studies, demonstrate that nnMobileNet++ achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive accuracy while maintaining low computational cost, underscoring its potential as a lightweight yet effective framework for retinal image analysis.

- **Summary**: Acoustic sonar image analysis plays a critical role in object detection and classification, with applications in both civilian and defense domains. Despite the availability of real and synthetic datasets, existing AI models that achieve high accuracy often over-rely on seafloor features, leading to poor generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates two key modules: (i) a Targeted Contrastive Unlearning (TCU) module, which extends the traditional triplet loss to reduce seafloor-induced background bias and improve generalization, and (ii) the Unlearn to Explain Sonar Framework (UESF), which provides visual insights into what the model has deliberately forgotten while adapting the LIME explainer to generate more faithful and localized attributions for unlearning evaluation. Extensive experiments across both real and synthetic sonar datasets validate our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in unlearning effectiveness, model robustness, and interpretability.

Traditional methods typically produce a single segmentation mask, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Recent generative models enable the creation of multiple plausible masks per image, mimicking the collaborative interpretation of several clinicians. However, these approaches remain computationally heavy. We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules. MedSegLatDiff is evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules). It achieves state of the art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores while simultaneously generating diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps. This provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making the model particularly suitable for clinical deployment.

- **Summary**: Real-time 3D reconstruction is a fundamental task in computer graphics. Recently, differentiable-rendering-based SLAM system has demonstrated significant potential, enabling photorealistic scene rendering through learnable scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Current differentiable rendering methods face dual challenges in real-time computation and sensor noise sensitivity, leading to degraded geometric fidelity in scene reconstruction and limited practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel real-time system EGG-Fusion, featuring robust sparse-to-dense camera tracking and a geometry-aware Gaussian surfel mapping module, introducing an information filter-based fusion method that explicitly accounts for sensor noise to achieve high-precision surface reconstruction. The proposed differentiable Gaussian surfel mapping effectively models multi-view consistent surfaces while enabling efficient parameter optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a surface reconstruction error of 0.6\textit{cm} on standardized benchmark datasets including Replica and ScanNet++, representing over 20\% improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GS-based methods. Notably, the system maintains real-time processing capabilities at 24 FPS, establishing it as one of the most accurate differentiable-rendering-based real-time reconstruction systems.

- **Summary**: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) remains a fundamental challenge in video understanding, aiming to identify the start time, end time, and category of all action instances within untrimmed videos. While recent single-stage, anchor-free models like ActionFormer have set a high standard by leveraging Transformers for temporal reasoning, they often struggle with two persistent issues: the precise localization of actions with ambiguous or "fuzzy" temporal boundaries and the effective fusion of multi-scale contextual information. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Boundary Transformer (TBT-Former), a new architecture that directly addresses these limitations. TBT-Former enhances the strong ActionFormer baseline with three core contributions: (1) a higher-capacity scaled Transformer backbone with an increased number of attention heads and an expanded Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) dimension for more powerful temporal feature extraction; (2) a cross-scale feature pyramid network (FPN) that integrates a top-down pathway with lateral connections, enabling richer fusion of high-level semantics and low-level temporal details; and (3) a novel boundary distribution regression head. Inspired by the principles of Generalized Focal Loss (GFL), this new head recasts the challenging task of boundary regression as a more flexible probability distribution learning problem, allowing the model to explicitly represent and reason about boundary uncertainty. Within the paradigm of Transformer-based architectures, TBT-Former advances the formidable benchmark set by its predecessors, establishing a new level of performance on the highly competitive THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens 100 datasets, while remaining competitive on the large-scale ActivityNet-1.3.

- **Summary**: Despite recent text-to-image models achieving highfidelity text rendering, they still struggle with long or multiple texts due to diluted global attention. We propose DCText, a training-free visual text generation method that adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, leveraging the reliable short-text generation of Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers. Our method first decomposes a prompt by extracting and dividing the target text, then assigns each to a designated region. To accurately render each segment within their regions while preserving overall image coherence, we introduce two attention masks - Text-Focus and Context-Expansion - applied sequentially during denoising. Additionally, Localized Noise Initialization further improves text accuracy and region alignment without increasing computational cost. Extensive experiments on single- and multisentence benchmarks show that DCText achieves the best text accuracy without compromising image quality while also delivering the lowest generation latency.

- **Summary**: Branches swaying in the breeze, flags rippling in the wind, and boats rocking on the water all show how aerodynamics shape natural motion -- an effect crucial for realism in vision and graphics. In this paper, we present Gaussian Swaying, a surface-based framework for aerodynamic simulation using 3D Gaussians. Unlike mesh-based methods that require costly meshing, or particle-based approaches that rely on discrete positional data, Gaussian Swaying models surfaces continuously with 3D Gaussians, enabling efficient and fine-grained aerodynamic interaction. Our framework unifies simulation and rendering on the same representation: Gaussian patches, which support force computation for dynamics while simultaneously providing normals for lightweight shading. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets across multiple metrics demonstrate that Gaussian Swaying achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for realistic aerodynamic scene simulation.

- **Summary**: Large-scale brain imaging datasets provide unprecedented opportunities for developing domain foundation models through pretraining. However, unlike natural image datasets in computer vision, these neuroimaging data often exhibit high heterogeneity in quality, ranging from well-structured scans to severely distorted or incomplete brain volumes. This raises a fundamental question: can noise or low-quality scans contribute meaningfully to pretraining, or do they instead hinder model learning? In this study, we systematically explore the role of data quality level in pretraining and its impact on downstream tasks. Specifically, we perform pretraining on datasets with different quality levels and perform fine-tuning for brain age prediction on external cohorts. Our results show significant performance differences across quality levels, revealing both opportunities and limitations. We further discuss the gap between computer vision practices and clinical neuroimaging standards, emphasizing the necessity of domain-aware curation to ensure trusted and generalizable domain-specific foundation models.

- **Summary**: In recent years, significant developments have been made in both video retrieval and video moment retrieval tasks, which respectively retrieve complete videos or moments for a given text query. These advancements have greatly improved user satisfaction during the search process. However, previous work has failed to establish meaningful "interaction" between the retrieval system and the user, and its one-way retrieval paradigm can no longer fully meet the personalization and dynamic needs of at least 80.8\% of users. In this paper, we introduce the Interactive Video Corpus Retrieval (IVCR) task, a more realistic setting that enables multi-turn, conversational, and realistic interactions between the user and the retrieval system. To facilitate research on this challenging task, we introduce IVCR-200K, a high-quality, bilingual, multi-turn, conversational, and abstract semantic dataset that supports video retrieval and even moment retrieval. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive framework based on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to help users interact in several modes with more explainable solutions. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and framework.

- **Summary**: In the digital economy era, digital watermarking serves as a critical basis for ownership proof of massive replicable content, including AI-generated and other virtual assets. Designing robust watermarks capable of withstanding various attacks and processing operations is even more paramount. We introduce TokenPure, a novel Diffusion Transformer-based framework designed for effective and consistent watermark removal. TokenPure solves the trade-off between thorough watermark destruction and content consistency by leveraging token-based conditional reconstruction. It reframes the task as conditional generation, entirely bypassing the initial watermark-carrying noise. We achieve this by decomposing the watermarked image into two complementary token sets: visual tokens for texture and structural tokens for geometry. These tokens jointly condition the diffusion process, enabling the framework to synthesize watermark-free images with fine-grained consistency and structural integrity. Comprehensive experiments show that TokenPure achieves state-of-the-art watermark removal and reconstruction fidelity, substantially outperforming existing baselines in both perceptual quality and consistency.

- **Summary**: Foreign Object Debris (FOD) within aircraft fuel tanks presents critical safety hazards including fuel contamination, system malfunctions, and increased maintenance costs. Despite the severity of these risks, there is a notable lack of dedicated datasets for the complex, enclosed environments found inside fuel tanks. To bridge this gap, we present a novel dataset, FOD-S2R, composed of real and synthetic images of the FOD within a simulated aircraft fuel tank. Unlike existing datasets that focus on external or open-air environments, our dataset is the first to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the real-world FOD detection performance in confined, closed structures. The real-world subset consists of 3,114 high-resolution HD images captured in a controlled fuel tank replica, while the synthetic subset includes 3,137 images generated using Unreal Engine. The dataset is composed of various Field of views (FOV), object distances, lighting conditions, color, and object size. Prior research has demonstrated that synthetic data can reduce reliance on extensive real-world annotations and improve the generalizability of vision models. Thus, we benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection models and demonstrate that introducing synthetic data improves the detection accuracy and generalization to real-world conditions. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the model performance and narrowing the Sim2Real gap, providing a valuable foundation for developing automated FOD detection systems for aviation maintenance.

- **Summary**: The precise segmentation of intracranial aneurysms and their parent vessels (IA-Vessel) is a critical step for hemodynamic analyses, which mainly depends on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, current segmentation methods predominantly focus on image-based evaluation metrics, often neglecting their practical effectiveness in subsequent CFD applications. To address this deficiency, we present the Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation (IAVS) dataset, the first comprehensive, multi-center collection comprising 641 3D MRA images with 587 annotations of aneurysms and IA-Vessels. In addition to image-mask pairs, IAVS dataset includes detailed hemodynamic analysis outcomes, addressing the limitations of existing datasets that neglect topological integrity and CFD applicability. To facilitate the development and evaluation of clinically relevant techniques, we construct two evaluation benchmarks including global localization of aneurysms (Stage I) and fine-grained segmentation of IA-Vessel (Stage II) and develop a simple and effective two-stage framework, which can be used as a out-of-the-box method and strong baseline. For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes. The dataset, code, and model will be public available at https://github.com/AbsoluteResonance/IAVS.

- **Summary**: Liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs) provide dense, high-fidelity 3D measurements of particle interactions and underpin current and future neutrino and rare-event experiments. Physics reconstruction typically relies on complex detector-specific pipelines that use tens of hand-engineered pattern recognition algorithms or cascades of task-specific neural networks that require extensive, labeled simulation that requires a careful, time-consuming calibration process. We introduce \textbf{Panda}, a model that learns reusable sensor-level representations directly from raw unlabeled LArTPC data. Panda couples a hierarchical sparse 3D encoder with a multi-view, prototype-based self-distillation objective. On a simulated dataset, Panda substantially improves label efficiency and reconstruction quality, beating the previous state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model with 1,000$\times$ fewer labels. We also show that a single set-prediction head 1/20th the size of the backbone with no physical priors trained on frozen outputs from Panda can result in particle identification that is comparable with state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction tools. Full fine-tuning further improves performance across all tasks.

- **Summary**: Topology-consistent dynamic model sequences are essential for applications such as animation and model editing. However, existing 4D reconstruction methods face challenges in generating high-quality topology-consistent meshes. To address this, we propose a topology-aware dynamic reconstruction framework based on Gaussian Splatting. We introduce a Gaussian topological structure that explicitly encodes spatial connectivity. This structure enables topology-aware densification and pruning, preserving the manifold consistency of the Gaussian representation. Temporal regularization terms further ensure topological coherence over time, while differentiable mesh rasterization improves mesh quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reconstructs topology-consistent mesh sequences with significantly higher accuracy than existing approaches. Moreover, the resulting meshes enable precise 3D keypoint tracking. Project page: https://haza628.github.io/tagSplat/

- **Summary**: Stroke is a major cause of death and permanent impairment, making it a major worldwide health concern. For prompt intervention and successful preventative tactics, early risk assessment is essential. To address this challenge, we used ensemble modeling and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to create an interpretable machine learning framework for stroke risk prediction. A thorough evaluation of 10 different machine learning models using 5-fold cross-validation across several datasets was part of our all-inclusive strategy, which also included feature engineering and data pretreatment (using Random Over-Sampling (ROS) to solve class imbalance). Our optimized ensemble model (Random Forest + ExtraTrees + XGBoost) performed exceptionally well, obtaining a strong 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset (SPD). We improved the model's transparency and clinical applicability by identifying three important clinical variables using LIME-based interpretability analysis: age, hypertension, and glucose levels. Through early prediction, this study highlights how combining ensemble learning with explainable AI (XAI) can deliver highly accurate and interpretable stroke risk assessment. By enabling data-driven prevention and personalized clinical decisions, our framework has the potential to transform stroke prediction and cardiovascular risk management.

- **Summary**: Text-guided image-to-video (TI2V) generation has recently achieved remarkable progress, particularly in maintaining subject consistency and temporal coherence. However, existing methods still struggle to adhere to fine-grained prompt semantics, especially when prompts entail substantial transformations of the input image (e.g., object addition, deletion, or modification), a shortcoming we term semantic negligence. In a pilot study, we find that applying a Gaussian blur to the input image improves semantic adherence. Analyzing attention maps, we observe clearer foreground-background separation. From an energy perspective, this corresponds to a lower-entropy cross-attention distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce AlignVid, a training-free framework with two components: (i) Attention Scaling Modulation (ASM), which directly reweights attention via lightweight Q or K scaling, and (ii) Guidance Scheduling (GS), which applies ASM selectively across transformer blocks and denoising steps to reduce visual quality degradation. This minimal intervention improves prompt adherence while limiting aesthetic degradation. In addition, we introduce OmitI2V to evaluate semantic negligence in TI2V generation, comprising 367 human-annotated samples that span addition, deletion, and modification scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignVid can enhance semantic fidelity.

- **Summary**: Speech-driven Talking Human (TH) generation, commonly known as "Talker," currently faces limitations in multi-subject driving capabilities. Extending this paradigm to "Multi-Talker," capable of animating multiple subjects simultaneously, introduces richer interactivity and stronger immersion in audiovisual communication. However, current Multi-Talkers still exhibit noticeable quality degradation caused by technical limitations, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. To address this challenge, we construct THQA-MT, the first large-scale Multi-Talker-generated Talking Human Quality Assessment dataset, consisting of 5,492 Multi-Talker-generated THs (MTHs) from 15 representative Multi-Talkers using 400 real portraits collected online. Through subjective experiments, we analyze perceptual discrepancies among different Multi-Talkers and identify 12 common types of distortion. Furthermore, we introduce EvalTalker, a novel TH quality assessment framework. This framework possesses the ability to perceive global quality, human characteristics, and identity consistency, while integrating Qwen-Sync to perceive multimodal synchrony. Experimental results demonstrate that EvalTalker achieves superior correlation with subjective scores, providing a robust foundation for future research on high-quality Multi-Talker generation and evaluation.

- **Summary**: Large-scale video-text pretraining achieves strong performance but depends on noisy, synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, often overlooking implicit world knowledge such as object motion, 3D geometry, and physical cues. In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning.

- **Summary**: Despite considerable progress in handwritten text recognition, paragraph-level handwritten text recognition, especially in low-resource languages, such as Hindi, Urdu and similar scripts, remains a challenging problem. These languages, often lacking comprehensive linguistic resources, require special attention to develop robust systems for accurate optical character recognition (OCR). This paper introduces BharatOCR, a novel segmentation-free paragraph-level handwritten Hindi and Urdu text recognition. We propose a ViT-Transformer Decoder-LM architecture for handwritten text recognition, where a Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts visual features, a Transformer decoder generates text sequences, and a pre-trained language model (LM) refines the output to improve accuracy, fluency, and coherence. Our model utilizes a Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model proposed for masked image modeling in this research work. In addition, we adopt a RoBERTa architecture optimized for masked language modeling (MLM) to enhance the linguistic comprehension and generative capabilities of the proposed model. The transformer decoder generates text sequences from visual embeddings. This model is designed to iteratively process a paragraph image line by line, called implicit line segmentation. The proposed model was evaluated using our custom dataset ('Parimal Urdu') and ('Parimal Hindi'), introduced in this research work, as well as two public datasets. The proposed model achieved benchmark results in the NUST-UHWR, PUCIT-OUHL, and Parimal-Urdu datasets, achieving character recognition rates of 96.24%, 92.05%, and 94.80%, respectively. The model also provided benchmark results using the Hindi dataset achieving a character recognition rate of 80.64%. The results obtained from our proposed model indicated that it outperformed several state-of-the-art Urdu text recognition methods.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised and open-vocabulary 3D object detection has recently gained attention, particularly in autonomous driving, where reducing annotation costs and recognizing unseen objects are critical for both safety and scalability. However, most existing approaches uniformly annotate 3D bounding boxes, ignore objects' physical states, and require multiple self-training iterations for annotation refinement, resulting in suboptimal quality and substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose OpenBox, a two-stage automatic annotation pipeline that leverages a 2D vision foundation model. In the first stage, OpenBox associates instance-level cues from 2D images processed by a vision foundation model with the corresponding 3D point clouds via cross-modal instance alignment. In the second stage, it categorizes instances by rigidity and motion state, then generates adaptive bounding boxes with class-specific size statistics. As a result, OpenBox produces high-quality 3D bounding box annotations without requiring self-training. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset, the Lyft Level 5 Perception dataset, and the nuScenes dataset demonstrate improved accuracy and efficiency over baselines.

- **Summary**: Failing to be aware of speeding vehicles approaching from behind poses a huge threat to the road safety of pedestrians and cyclists. In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.

- **Summary**: 3D generation and reconstruction techniques have been widely used in computer games, film, and other content creation areas. As the application grows, there is a growing demand for 3D shapes that look truly realistic. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a ground truth to measure mesh fidelity. However, in many practical cases, a shape's realism does not depend on having a ground truth reference. In this work, we propose a Shape-Realism Alignment Metric that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a bridge between mesh shape information and realism evaluation. To achieve this, we adopt a mesh encoding approach that converts 3D shapes into the language token space. A dedicated realism decoder is designed to align the language model's output with human perception of realism. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset, RealismGrading, which provides human-annotated realism scores without the need for ground truth shapes. Our dataset includes shapes generated by 16 different algorithms on over a dozen objects, making it more representative of practical 3D shape distributions. We validate our metric's performance and generalizability through k-fold cross-validation across different objects. Experimental results show that our metric correlates well with human perceptions and outperforms existing methods, and has good generalizability.

- **Summary**: Textured high-fidelity 3D models are crucial for games, AR/VR, and film, but human-aligned evaluation methods still fall behind despite recent advances in 3D reconstruction and generation. Existing metrics, such as Chamfer Distance, often fail to align with how humans evaluate the fidelity of 3D shapes. Recent learning-based metrics attempt to improve this by relying on rendered images and 2D image quality metrics. However, these approaches face limitations due to incomplete structural coverage and sensitivity to viewpoint choices. Moreover, most methods are trained on synthetic distortions, which differ significantly from real-world distortions, resulting in a domain gap. To address these challenges, we propose a new fidelity evaluation method that is based directly on 3D meshes with texture, without relying on rendering. Our method, named Textured Geometry Evaluation TGE, jointly uses the geometry and color information to calculate the fidelity of the input textured mesh with comparison to a reference colored shape. To train and evaluate our metric, we design a human-annotated dataset with real-world distortions. Experiments show that TGE outperforms rendering-based and geometry-only methods on real-world distortion dataset.

- **Summary**: Exemplar-guided Image Editing (EIE) aims to modify a source image according to a visual reference. Existing approaches often require large-scale pre-training to learn relationships between the source and reference images, incurring high computational costs. As a training-free alternative, inversion techniques can be used to map the source image into a latent space for manipulation. However, our empirical study reveals that standard inversion is sub-optimal for EIE, leading to poor quality and inefficiency. To tackle this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Reversible Inversion ({ReInversion})} for effective and efficient EIE. Specifically, ReInversion operates as a two-stage denoising process, which is first conditioned on the source image and subsequently on the reference. Besides, we introduce a Mask-Guided Selective Denoising (MSD) strategy to constrain edits to target regions, preserving the structural consistency of the background. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our ReInversion method achieves state-of-the-art EIE performance with the lowest computational overhead.

- **Summary**: Understanding dynamic 4D environments-3D space evolving over time-is critical for robotic and interactive systems. These applications demand systems that can process streaming point cloud video in real-time, often under resource constraints, while also benefiting from past and present observations when available. However, current 4D backbone networks rely heavily on spatiotemporal convolutions and Transformers, which are often computationally intensive and poorly suited to real-time applications. We propose PointNet4D, a lightweight 4D backbone optimized for both online and offline settings. At its core is a Hybrid Mamba-Transformer temporal fusion block, which integrates the efficient state-space modeling of Mamba and the bidirectional modeling power of Transformers. This enables PointNet4D to handle variable-length online sequences efficiently across different deployment scenarios. To enhance temporal understanding, we introduce 4DMAP, a frame-wise masked auto-regressive pretraining strategy that captures motion cues across frames. Our extensive evaluations across 9 tasks on 7 datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements across diverse domains. We further demonstrate PointNet4D's utility by building two robotic application systems: 4D Diffusion Policy and 4D Imitation Learning, achieving substantial gains on the RoboTwin and HandoverSim benchmarks.



### FRAMER: Frequency-Aligned Self-Distillation with Adaptive Modulation Leveraging Diffusion Priors for Real-World Image Super-Resolution

- **Summary**: Real-image super-resolution (Real-ISR) seeks to recover HR images from LR inputs with mixed, unknown degradations. While diffusion models surpass GANs in perceptual quality, they under-reconstruct high-frequency (HF) details due to a low-frequency (LF) bias and a depth-wise "low-first, high-later" hierarchy. We introduce FRAMER, a plug-and-play training scheme that exploits diffusion priors without changing the backbone or inference. At each denoising step, the final-layer feature map teaches all intermediate layers. Teacher and student feature maps are decomposed into LF/HF bands via FFT masks to align supervision with the model's internal frequency hierarchy. For LF, an Intra Contrastive Loss (IntraCL) stabilizes globally shared structure. For HF, an Inter Contrastive Loss (InterCL) sharpens instance-specific details using random-layer and in-batch negatives. Two adaptive modulators, Frequency-based Adaptive Weight (FAW) and Frequency-based Alignment Modulation (FAM), reweight per-layer LF/HF signals and gate distillation by current similarity. Across U-Net and DiT backbones (e.g., Stable Diffusion 2, 3), FRAMER consistently improves PSNR/SSIM and perceptual metrics (LPIPS, NIQE, MANIQA, MUSIQ). Ablations validate the final-layer teacher and random-layer negatives.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in multimodal tasks but often exhibit Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in culturally diverse regions like Southeast Asia (SEA). To address this, we introduce RICE-VL, a novel benchmark evaluating VLM cultural understanding across 11 ASEAN countries. RICE-VL includes over 28,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples -- covering True or False, Fill-in-the-Blank, and open-ended formats -- and 1,000 image-bounding box pairs for Visual Grounding, annotated by culturally informed experts across 14 sub-ground categories. We propose SEA-LAVE, an extension of the LAVE metric, assessing textual accuracy, cultural alignment, and country identification. Evaluations of six open- and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance gaps in low-resource countries and abstract cultural domains. The Visual Grounding task tests models' ability to localize culturally significant elements in complex scenes, probing spatial and contextual accuracy. RICE-VL exposes limitations in VLMs' cultural comprehension and highlights the need for inclusive model development to better serve diverse global populations.

- **Summary**: Mask Diffusion Models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to auto-regressive models (ARMs) for vision-language tasks, owing to their flexible balance of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce MDMs into the Scene Text Recognition (STR) task. We show that vanilla MDM lags behind ARMs in terms of accuracy, although it improves recognition efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose MDiff4STR, a Mask Diffusion model enhanced with two key improvement strategies tailored for STR. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in applying MDMs to STR: noising gap between training and inference, and overconfident predictions during inference. Both significantly hinder the performance of MDMs. To mitigate the first issue, we develop six noising strategies that better align training with inference behavior. For the second, we propose a token-replacement noise mechanism that provides a non-mask noise type, encouraging the model to reconsider and revise overly confident but incorrect predictions. We conduct extensive evaluations of MDiff4STR on both standard and challenging STR benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios including irregular, artistic, occluded, and Chinese text, as well as whether the use of pretraining. Across these settings, MDiff4STR consistently outperforms popular STR models, surpassing state-of-the-art ARMs in accuracy, while maintaining fast inference with only three denoising steps.

- **Summary**: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit errors in complex video reasoning scenarios, correcting these errors is critical for uncovering their weaknesses and improving performance. However, existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' ability to identify and correct these video reasoning errors. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{ViRectify}, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their fine-grained correction capability. Through an AI-assisted annotation pipeline with human verification, we construct a dataset of over 30\textit{K} instances spanning dynamic perception, scientific reasoning, and embodied decision-making domains. In \textit{ViRectify}, we challenge MLLMs to perform step-wise error identification and generate rationales with key video evidence grounding. In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our \textit{ViRectify} serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94\% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on \textit{ViRectify}, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning. We believe \textit{ViRectify} provides a new direction for comprehensively evaluating the advanced MLLMs in video reasoning.

- **Summary**: Leveraging pre-trained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-resolution (HR) image synthesis often leads to spatial layout collapse and degraded texture fidelity. Prior work mitigates these issues with complex pipelines that first perform a base-resolution (i.e., training-resolution) denoising process to guide HR generation. We instead explore the intrinsic generative mechanisms of DiTs and propose ResDiT, a training-free method that scales resolution efficiently. We identify the core factor governing spatial layout, position embeddings (PEs), and show that the original PEs encode incorrect positional information when extrapolated to HR, which triggers layout collapse. To address this, we introduce a PE scaling technique that rectifies positional encoding under resolution changes. To further remedy low-fidelity details, we develop a local-enhancement mechanism grounded in base-resolution local attention. We design a patch-level fusion module that aggregates global and local cues, together with a Gaussian-weighted splicing strategy that eliminates grid artifacts. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ResDiT consistently delivers high-fidelity, high-resolution image synthesis and integrates seamlessly with downstream tasks, including spatially controlled generation.

- **Summary**: Open-world and anomaly segmentation methods seek to enable autonomous driving systems to detect and segment both known and unknown objects in real-world scenes. However, existing methods do not assign semantically meaningful labels to unknown regions, and distinguishing and learning representations for unknown classes remains difficult. While open-vocabulary segmentation methods show promise in generalizing to novel classes, they require a fixed inference vocabulary and thus cannot be directly applied to anomaly segmentation where unknown classes are unconstrained. We propose Clipomaly, the first CLIP-based open-world and anomaly segmentation method for autonomous driving. Our zero-shot approach requires no anomaly-specific training data and leverages CLIP's shared image-text embedding space to both segment unknown objects and assign human-interpretable names to them. Unlike open-vocabulary methods, our model dynamically extends its vocabulary at inference time without retraining, enabling robust detection and naming of anomalies beyond common class definitions such as those in Cityscapes. Clipomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on established anomaly segmentation benchmarks while providing interpretability and flexibility essential for practical deployment.

- **Summary**: 3D human avatar animation aims at transforming a human avatar from an arbitrary initial pose to a specified target pose using deformation algorithms. Existing approaches typically divide this task into two stages: canonical template construction and target pose deformation. However, current template construction methods demand extensive skeletal rigging and often produce artifacts for specific poses. Moreover, target pose deformation suffers from structural distortions caused by Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), which significantly undermines animation realism. To address these problems, we propose a unified learning-based framework to address both challenges in two phases. For the former phase, to overcome the inefficiencies and artifacts during template construction, we leverage a U-Net architecture that decouples texture and pose information in a feed-forward process, enabling fast generation of a human template. For the latter phase, we propose a data-driven refinement technique that enhances structural integrity. Extensive experiments show that our model delivers consistent performance across diverse poses with an optimal balance between efficiency and quality,surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

- **Summary**: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling multi-task capabilities without additional training. However, existing methods often experience substantial performance degradation compared with individually fine-tuned models, even on similar tasks, underscoring the need to preserve task-specific information. This paper proposes Decomposition, Thresholding, and Scaling (DTS), an approximation-based personalized merging framework that preserves task-specific information with minimal storage overhead. DTS first applies singular value decomposition to the task-specific information and retains only a small subset of singular values and vectors. It then introduces a novel thresholding strategy that partitions singular vector elements into groups and assigns a scaling factor to each group. To enable generalization to unseen tasks, we further extend DTS with a variant that fuses task-specific information in a data-free manner based on the semantic similarity of task characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while requiring only 1\% additional storage per task. Furthermore, experiments on unseen tasks show that the DTS variant achieves significantly better generalization performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/krumpguo/DTS.

- **Summary**: This paper presents CourtMotion, a spatiotemporal modeling framework for analyzing and predicting game events and plays as they develop in professional basketball. Anticipating basketball events requires understanding both physical motion patterns and their semantic significance in the context of the game. Traditional approaches that use only player positions fail to capture crucial indicators such as body orientation, defensive stance, or shooting preparation motions. Our two-stage approach first processes skeletal tracking data through Graph Neural Networks to capture nuanced motion patterns, then employs a Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms to model player interactions. We introduce event projection heads that explicitly connect player movements to basketball events like passes, shots, and steals, training the model to associate physical motion patterns with their tactical purposes. Experiments on NBA tracking data demonstrate significant improvements over position-only baselines: 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-based models and consistent performance gains across key basketball analytics tasks. The resulting pretrained model serves as a powerful foundation for multiple downstream tasks, with pick detection, shot taker identification, assist prediction, shot location classification, and shot type recognition demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods.

- **Summary**: Although prevailing camera-controlled video generation models can produce cinematic results, lifting them directly to the generation of 3D-consistent and high-fidelity time-synchronized multi-view videos remains challenging, which is a pivotal capability for taming 4D worlds. Some works resort to data augmentation or test-time optimization, but these strategies are constrained by limited model generalization and scalability issues. To this end, we propose ChronosObserver, a training-free method including World State Hyperspace to represent the spatiotemporal constraints of a 4D world scene, and Hyperspace Guided Sampling to synchronize the diffusion sampling trajectories of multiple views using the hyperspace. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity and 3D-consistent time-synchronized multi-view videos generation without training or fine-tuning for diffusion models.

- **Summary**: We introduce a variational approach for extracting curves between a list of possible endpoints, based on the discretization of an energy and Smirnov's decomposition theorem for vector fields. It is used to design a bi-level minimization approach to automatically extract curves and 1D structures from an image, which is mostly unsupervised. We extend then the method to curvature-dependent energies, using a now classical lifting of the curves in the space of positions and orientations equipped with an appropriate sub-Riemanian or Finslerian metric.

- **Summary**: Video instance segmentation (VIS) for low-light content remains highly challenging for both humans and machines alike, due to adverse imaging conditions including noise, blur and low-contrast. The lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the limitations of current synthetic pipelines, particularly in modeling temporal degradations, further hinder progress. Moreover, existing VIS methods are not robust to the degradations found in low-light videos and, as a result, perform poorly even when finetuned on low-light data. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ELVIS} (\textbf{E}nhance \textbf{L}ow-light for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{S}egmentation), a novel framework that enables effective domain adaptation of state-of-the-art VIS models to low-light scenarios. ELVIS comprises an unsupervised synthetic low-light video pipeline that models both spatial and temporal degradations, a calibration-free degradation profile synthesis network (VDP-Net) and an enhancement decoder head that disentangles degradations from content features. ELVIS improves performances by up to \textbf{+3.7AP} on the synthetic low-light YouTube-VIS 2019 dataset. Code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: We tackle the challenging problem of single-source domain generalization (DG) for medical image segmentation. To this end, we aim for training a network on one domain (e.g., CT) and directly apply it to a different domain (e.g., MR) without adapting the model and without requiring images or annotations from the new domain during training. We propose a novel method for promoting DG when training deep segmentation networks, which we call SRCSM. During training, our method diversifies the source domain through semantic-aware random convolution, where different regions of a source image are augmented differently, based on their annotation labels. At test-time, we complement the randomization of the training domain via mapping the intensity of target domain images, making them similar to source domain data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on a variety of cross-modality and cross-center generalization settings for abdominal, whole-heart and prostate segmentation, where we outperform previous DG techniques in a vast majority of experiments. Additionally, we also investigate our method when training on whole-heart CT or MR data and testing on the diastolic and systolic phase of cine MR data captured with different scanner hardware, where we make a step towards closing the domain gap in this even more challenging setting. Overall, our evaluation shows that SRCSM can be considered a new state-of-the-art in DG for medical image segmentation and, moreover, even achieves a segmentation performance that matches the performance of the in-domain baseline in several settings.

- **Summary**: Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading technique for generating images due to their ability to create high-resolution and realistic images. Despite their strong performance, diffusion models still struggle in managing image collections with significant feature differences. They often fail to capture complex features and produce conflicting results. Research has attempted to address this issue by learning different regions of an image through multiple diffusion paths and then combining them. However, this approach leads to inefficient coordination among multiple paths and high computational costs. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Diffusion Fuzzy System (DFS), a latent-space multi-path diffusion model guided by fuzzy rules. DFS offers several advantages. First, unlike traditional multi-path diffusion methods, DFS uses multiple diffusion paths, each dedicated to learning a specific class of image features. By assigning each path to a different feature type, DFS overcomes the limitations of multi-path models in capturing heterogeneous image features. Second, DFS employs rule-chain-based reasoning to dynamically steer the diffusion process and enable efficient coordination among multiple paths. Finally, DFS introduces a fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression mechanism to reduce the computational costs of multi-path diffusion effectively. We tested our method on three public datasets: LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO. The results show that DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing single-path and multi-path diffusion models. Additionally, DFS surpasses baseline models in both image quality and alignment between text and images, and also shows improved accuracy when comparing generated images to target references.



### Deep Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain Imaging: Large-Scale Benchmarking and Bias Analysis

- **Summary**: Deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising route to identify pathological deviations without requiring lesion-specific annotations. Yet, fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress toward clinical translation. Here, we present a large-scale, multi-center benchmark of deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain imaging. The training cohort comprised 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2-weighted scans from healthy individuals across six scanners, with ages ranging from 6 to 89 years. Validation used 92 scans to tune hyperparameters and estimate unbiased thresholds. Testing encompassed 2,221 T1w and 1,262 T2w scans spanning healthy datasets and diverse clinical cohorts. Across all algorithms, the Dice-based segmentation performance varied between 0.03 and 0.65, indicating substantial variability. To assess robustness, we systematically evaluated the impact of different scanners, lesion types and sizes, as well as demographics (age, sex). Reconstruction-based methods, particularly diffusion-inspired approaches, achieved the strongest lesion segmentation performance, while feature-based methods showed greater robustness under distributional shifts. However, systematic biases, such as scanner-related effects, were observed for the majority of algorithms, including that small and low-contrast lesions were missed more often, and that false positives varied with age and sex. Increasing healthy training data yields only modest gains, underscoring that current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are limited algorithmically rather than by data availability. Our benchmark establishes a transparent foundation for future research and highlights priorities for clinical translation, including image native pretraining, principled deviation measures, fairness-aware modeling, and robust domain adaptation.

- **Summary**: 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is a core challenge in computer vision. Recently, feed-forward methods have emerged as efficient and robust alternatives to traditional per-scene optimization techniques. Among them, state-of-the-art models like the Visual Geometry Grounding Transformer (VGGT) leverage full self-attention over all image tokens to capture global relationships. However, this approach suffers from poor scalability due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the large number of tokens generated in long image sequences. In this work, we introduce FlashVGGT, an efficient alternative that addresses this bottleneck through a descriptor-based attention mechanism. Instead of applying dense global attention across all tokens, FlashVGGT compresses spatial information from each frame into a compact set of descriptor tokens. Global attention is then computed as cross-attention between the full set of image tokens and this smaller descriptor set, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, the compactness of the descriptors enables online inference over long sequences via a chunk-recursive mechanism that reuses cached descriptors from previous chunks. Experimental results show that FlashVGGT achieves reconstruction accuracy competitive with VGGT while reducing inference time to just 9.3% of VGGT for 1,000 images, and scaling efficiently to sequences exceeding 3,000 images.

- **Summary**: Embodied navigation for long-horizon tasks, guided by complex natural language instructions, remains a formidable challenge in artificial intelligence. Existing agents often struggle with robust long-term planning about unseen environments, leading to high failure rates. To address these limitations, we introduce NavForesee, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) that unifies high-level language planning and predictive world model imagination within a single, unified framework. Our approach empowers a single VLM to concurrently perform planning and predictive foresight. Conditioned on the full instruction and historical observations, the model is trained to understand the navigation instructions by decomposing the task, tracking its progress, and formulating the subsequent sub-goal. Simultaneously, it functions as a generative world model, providing crucial foresight by predicting short-term environmental dynamics and long-term navigation milestones. The VLM's structured plan guides its targeted prediction, while the imagined future provides rich context to inform the navigation actions, creating a powerful internal feedback loop of perception-planning/prediction-action. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmark that NavForesee achieves highly competitive performance in complex scenarios. Our work highlights the immense potential of fusing explicit language planning with implicit spatiotemporal prediction, paving the way for more intelligent and capable embodied agents.

- **Summary**: Head and neck masses are space-occupying lesions that can compress the airway and esophagus and may affect nerves and blood vessels. Available public datasets primarily focus on malignant lesions and often overlook other space-occupying conditions in this region. To address this gap, we introduce MasHeNe, an initial dataset of 3,779 contrast-enhanced CT slices that includes both tumors and cysts with pixel-level annotations. We also establish a benchmark using standard segmentation baselines and report common metrics to enable fair comparison. In addition, we propose the Windowing-Enhanced Mamba with Frequency integration (WEMF) model. WEMF applies tri-window enhancement to enrich the input appearance before feature extraction. It further uses multi-frequency attention to fuse information across skip connections within a U-shaped Mamba backbone. On MasHeNe, WEMF attains the best performance among evaluated methods, with a Dice of 70.45%, IoU of 66.89%, NSD of 72.33%, and HD95 of 5.12 mm. This model indicates stable and strong results on this challenging task. MasHeNe provides a benchmark for head-and-neck mass segmentation beyond malignancy-only datasets. The observed error patterns also suggest that this task remains challenging and requires further research. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/drthaodao3101/MasHeNe.git.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce RoleMotion, a large-scale human motion dataset that encompasses a wealth of role-playing and functional motion data tailored to fit various specific scenes. Existing text datasets are mainly constructed decentrally as amalgamation of assorted subsets that their data are nonfunctional and isolated to work together to cover social activities in various scenes. Also, the quality of motion data is inconsistent, and textual annotation lacks fine-grained details in these datasets. In contrast, RoleMotion is meticulously designed and collected with a particular focus on scenes and roles. The dataset features 25 classic scenes, 110 functional roles, over 500 behaviors, and 10296 high-quality human motion sequences of body and hands, annotated with 27831 fine-grained text descriptions. We build an evaluator stronger than existing counterparts, prove its reliability, and evaluate various text-to-motion methods on our dataset. Finally, we explore the interplay of motion generation of body and hands. Experimental results demonstrate the high-quality and functionality of our dataset on text-driven whole-body generation.

- **Summary**: Abscesses in the head and neck represent an acute infectious process that can potentially lead to sepsis or mortality if not diagnosed and managed promptly. Accurate detection and delineation of these lesions on imaging are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical intervention. In this study, we introduce AbscessHeNe, a curated and comprehensively annotated dataset comprising 4,926 contrast-enhanced CT slices with clinically confirmed head and neck abscesses. The dataset is designed to facilitate the development of robust semantic segmentation models that can accurately delineate abscess boundaries and evaluate deep neck space involvement, thereby supporting informed clinical decision-making. To establish performance baselines, we evaluate several state-of-the-art segmentation architectures, including CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based models. The highest-performing model achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.39, Intersection-over-Union of 0.27, and Normalized Surface Distance of 0.67, indicating the challenges of this task and the need for further research. Beyond segmentation, AbscessHeNe is structured for future applications in content-based multimedia indexing and case-based retrieval. Each CT scan is linked with pixel-level annotations and clinical metadata, providing a foundation for building intelligent retrieval systems and supporting knowledge-driven clinical workflows. The dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/drthaodao3101/AbscessHeNe.git.

- **Summary**: In well logging operations using the oil-based mud (OBM) microresistivity imager, which employs an interleaved design with upper and lower pad sets, depth misalignment issues persist between the pad images even after velocity correction. This paper presents a depth matching method for borehole images based on the Shape Dynamic Time Warping (ShapeDTW) algorithm. The method extracts local shape features to construct a morphologically sensitive distance matrix, better preserving structural similarity between sequences during alignment. We implement this by employing a combined feature set of the one-dimensional Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG1D) and the original signal as the shape descriptor. Field test examples demonstrate that our method achieves precise alignment for images with complex textures, depth shifts, or local scaling. Furthermore, it provides a flexible framework for feature extension, allowing the integration of other descriptors tailored to specific geological features.

- **Summary**: Articulated 3D objects are critical for embodied AI, robotics, and interactive scene understanding, yet creating simulation-ready assets remains labor-intensive and requires expert modeling of part hierarchies and motion structures. We introduce SPARK, a framework for reconstructing physically consistent, kinematic part-level articulated objects from a single RGB image. Given an input image, we first leverage VLMs to extract coarse URDF parameters and generate part-level reference images. We then integrate the part-image guidance and the inferred structure graph into a generative diffusion transformer to synthesize consistent part and complete shapes of articulated objects. To further refine the URDF parameters, we incorporate differentiable forward kinematics and differentiable rendering to optimize joint types, axes, and origins under VLM-generated open-state supervision. Extensive experiments show that SPARK produces high-quality, simulation-ready articulated assets across diverse categories, enabling downstream applications such as robotic manipulation and interaction modeling.

- **Summary**: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables fine-grained visual search by combining a reference image with a textual modification. While supervised CIR methods achieve high accuracy, their reliance on costly triplet annotations motivates zero-shot solutions. The core challenge in zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) stems from a fundamental dilemma: existing text-centric or diffusion-based approaches struggle to effectively bridge the vision-language modality gap. To address this, we propose Fusion-Diff, a novel generative editing framework with high effectiveness and data efficiency designed for multimodal alignment. First, it introduces a multimodal fusion feature editing strategy within a joint vision-language (VL) space, substantially narrowing the modality gap. Second, to maximize data efficiency, the framework incorporates a lightweight Control-Adapter, enabling state-of-the-art performance through fine-tuning on only a limited-scale synthetic dataset of 200K samples. Extensive experiments on standard CIR benchmarks (CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO) demonstrate that Fusion-Diff significantly outperforms prior zero-shot approaches. We further enhance the interpretability of our model by visualizing the fused multimodal representations.

- **Summary**: Test-Time Training (TTT) has recently emerged as a promising direction for efficient sequence modeling. TTT reformulates attention operation as an online learning problem, constructing a compact inner model from key-value pairs at test time. This reformulation opens a rich and flexible design space while achieving linear computational complexity. However, crafting a powerful visual TTT design remains challenging: fundamental choices for the inner module and inner training lack comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we present a systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling. From a series of experiments and analyses, we distill six practical insights that establish design principles for effective visual TTT and illuminate paths for future improvement. These findings culminate in the Vision Test-Time Training (ViT$^3$) model, a pure TTT architecture that achieves linear complexity and parallelizable computation. We evaluate ViT$^3$ across diverse visual tasks, including image classification, image generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Results show that ViT$^3$ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (e.g., Mamba and linear attention variants) and effectively narrows the gap to highly optimized vision Transformers. We hope this study and the ViT$^3$ baseline can facilitate future work on visual TTT models. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ViTTT.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of retinal vessels is crucial for the clinical diagnosis of numerous ophthalmic and systemic diseases. However, traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods exhibit inherent limitations, struggling to capture long-range dependencies and complex nonlinear relationships. To address the above limitations, an Adaptive Dual Branch Kolmogorov-Arnold UNet (DB-KAUNet) is proposed for retinal vessel segmentation. In DB-KAUNet, we design a Heterogeneous Dual-Branch Encoder (HDBE) that features parallel CNN and Transformer pathways. The HDBE strategically interleaves standard CNN and Transformer blocks with novel KANConv and KAT blocks, enabling the model to form a comprehensive feature representation. To optimize feature processing, we integrate several critical components into the HDBE. First, a Cross-Branch Channel Interaction (CCI) module is embedded to facilitate efficient interaction of channel features between the parallel pathways. Second, an attention-based Spatial Feature Enhancement (SFE) module is employed to enhance spatial features and fuse the outputs from both branches. Building upon the SFE module, an advanced Spatial Feature Enhancement with Geometrically Adaptive Fusion (SFE-GAF) module is subsequently developed. In the SFE-GAF module, adaptive sampling is utilized to focus on true vessel morphology precisely. The adaptive process strengthens salient vascular features while significantly reducing background noise and computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 datasets validate that DB-KAUNet achieves leading segmentation performance and demonstrates exceptional robustness.

- **Summary**: Tiny object detection in remote sensing imagery has attracted significant research interest in recent years. Despite recent progress, achieving balanced detection performance across diverse object scales remains a formidable challenge, particularly in scenarios where dense tiny objects and large objects coexist. Although large foundation models have revolutionized general vision tasks, their application to tiny object detection remains unexplored due to the extreme scale variation and density distribution inherent to remote sensing imagery. To bridge this scale gap, we propose ScaleBridge-Det, to the best of our knowledge, the first large detection framework designed for tiny objects, which could achieve balanced performance across diverse scales through scale-adaptive expert routing and density-guided query allocation. Specifically, we introduce a Routing-Enhanced Mixture Attention (REM) module that dynamically selects and fuses scale-specific expert features via adaptive routing to address the tendency of standard MoE models to favor dominant scales. REM generates complementary and discriminative multi-scale representations suitable for both tiny and large objects. Furthermore, we present a Density-Guided Dynamic Query (DGQ) module that predicts object density to adaptively adjust query positions and numbers, enabling efficient resource allocation for objects of varying scales. The proposed framework allows ScaleBridge-Det to simultaneously optimize performance for both dense tiny and general objects without trade-offs. Extensive experiments on benchmark and cross-domain datasets demonstrate that ScaleBridge-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance on AI-TOD-V2 and DTOD, while exhibiting superior cross-domain robustness on VisDrone.

However, these models falter in long-tail settings, such as medical imaging, where rare pathologies comprise a small fraction of data. This results in mode collapse: tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining the goal of synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions. We pinpoint gradient conflicts between frequent head and rare tail classes as the primary culprit, a factor unaddressed by existing sampling or conditioning methods that mainly steer inference without altering the learned distribution. To resolve this, we propose GRASP: Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning. GRASP uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters that minimize intra-group gradient clashes. It then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency. On the long-tail MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels. Generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability. Our method is lightweight, scalable, and readily integrates with diffusion pipelines.

- **Summary**: Generating realistic hand-object interactions (HOI) videos is a significant challenge due to the difficulty of modeling physical constraints (e.g., contact and occlusion between hands and manipulated objects). Current methods utilize HOI representation as an auxiliary generative objective to guide video synthesis. However, there is a dilemma between 2D and 3D representations that cannot simultaneously guarantee scalability and interaction fidelity. To address this limitation, we propose a structure and contact-aware representation that captures hand-object contact, hand-object occlusion, and holistic structure context without 3D annotations. This interaction-oriented and scalable supervision signal enables the model to learn fine-grained interaction physics and generalize to open-world scenarios. To fully exploit the proposed representation, we introduce a joint-generation paradigm with a share-and-specialization strategy that generates interaction-oriented representations and videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets in generating physics-realistic and temporally coherent HOI videos. Furthermore, our approach exhibits strong generalization to challenging open-world scenarios, highlighting the benefit of our scalable design. Our project page is https://hgzn258.github.io/SCAR/.

- **Summary**: Accurate subtype classification and outcome prediction in mesothelioma are essential for guiding therapy and patient care. Most computational pathology models are trained on large tissue images from resection specimens, limiting their use in real-world settings where small biopsies are common. We show that a self-supervised encoder trained on resection tissue can be applied to biopsy material, capturing meaningful morphological patterns. Using these patterns, the model can predict patient survival and classify tumor subtypes. This approach demonstrates the potential of AI-driven tools to support diagnosis and treatment planning in mesothelioma.

- **Summary**: Current story visualization methods tend to position subjects solely by text and face challenges in maintaining artistic consistency. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamingComics, a layout-aware story visualization framework. We build upon a pretrained video diffusion-transformer (DiT) model, leveraging its spatiotemporal priors to enhance identity and style consistency. For layout-based position control, we propose RegionalRoPE, a region-aware positional encoding scheme that re-indexes embeddings based on the target layout. Additionally, we introduce a masked condition loss to further constrain each subject's visual features to their designated region. To infer layouts from natural language scripts, we integrate an LLM-based layout generator trained to produce comic-style layouts, enabling flexible and controllable layout conditioning. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our approach, showing a 29.2% increase in character consistency and a 36.2% increase in style similarity compared to previous methods, while displaying high spatial accuracy.

- **Summary**: Handling static images that lack inherent temporal dynamics remains a fundamental challenge for spiking neural networks (SNNs). In directly trained SNNs, static inputs are typically repeated across time steps, causing the temporal dimension to collapse into a rate like representation and preventing meaningful temporal modeling. This work revisits the reported performance gap between direct and rate based encodings and shows that it primarily stems from convolutional learnability and surrogate gradient formulations rather than the encoding schemes themselves. To illustrate this mechanism level clarification, we introduce a minimal learnable temporal encoding that adds adaptive phase shifts to induce meaningful temporal variation from static inputs.

- **Summary**: This study compares baseline (J0) and 24-hour (J1) diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting three-month functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Seventy-four AIS patients with paired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) scans and clinical data were analyzed. Three-dimensional ResNet-50 embeddings were fused with structured clinical variables, reduced via principal component analysis (<=12 components), and classified using linear support vector machines with eight-fold stratified group cross-validation. J1 multimodal models achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.923 +/- 0.085), outperforming J0-based configurations (AUC <= 0.86). Incorporating lesion-volume features further improved model stability and interpretability. These findings demonstrate that early post-treatment diffusion MRI provides superior prognostic value to pre-treatment imaging and that combining MRI, clinical, and lesion-volume features produces a robust and interpretable framework for predicting three-month functional outcomes in AIS patients.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has been widely applied to Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) tasks due to its powerful cross-modal semantic understanding capabilities. This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all single-stage approaches, as well as more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% and 50.6%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Streaming video understanding requires models not only to process temporally incoming frames, but also to anticipate user intention for realistic applications like AR glasses. While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop. All data and code will be publicly released to support continued research in gaze-guided streaming video understanding.

- **Summary**: Instruction-based image editing through natural language has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive visual manipulation. While recent models achieve impressive results on single edits, they suffer from severe quality degradation under multi-turn editing. Through systematic analysis, we identify progressive loss of high-frequency information as the primary cause of this quality degradation. We present FreqEdit, a training-free framework that enables stable editing across 10+ consecutive iterations. Our approach comprises three synergistic components: (1) high-frequency feature injection from reference velocity fields to preserve fine-grained details, (2) an adaptive injection strategy that spatially modulates injection strength for precise region-specific control, and (3) a path compensation mechanism that periodically recalibrates the editing trajectory to prevent over-constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqEdit achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and instruction following compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents require effective use of historical context to perform sequential navigation tasks. While incorporating past actions and observations can improve decision making, naive use of full history leads to excessive computational overhead and distraction from irrelevant information. To address this, we introduce HiconAgent, a GUI agent trained with History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) for efficient and effective utilization of historical information. HCPO optimizes history usage in both sampling and policy updates through two complementary components: (1) Dynamic Context Sampling (DCS) presents the agent with variable length histories during sampling, enabling adaptive use of the most relevant context; (2) Anchor-guided History Compression (AHC) refines the policy update phase with a dual branch strategy where the compressed branch removes history observations while keeping history actions as information flow anchors. The compressed and uncompressed branches are coupled through a history-enhanced alignment loss to enforce consistent history usage while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on mainstream GUI navigation benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Despite being smaller, HiconAgent-3B outperforms GUI-R1-7B by +8.46 percent grounding accuracy and +11.32 percent step success rate on GUI-Odyssey, while achieving comparable results on AndroidControl and AITW with up to 2.47x computational speedup and 60 percent FLOPs reduction.

- **Summary**: Automatically understanding video contents is important for several applications in Civic Monitoring (CM), general Surveillance (SL), Assisted Living (AL), etc. Decades of Image and Video Analysis (IVA) research have advanced tasks such as content extraction (e.g., object recognition and tracking). Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain.   This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates. Extensive experiments were conducted across several interesting situations from three domains -- AL, CM, and SL-- to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach using a dataset of videos of varying lengths from these domains.

- **Summary**: Medical image registration is crucial for various clinical and research applications including disease diagnosis or treatment planning which require alignment of images from different modalities, time points, or subjects. Traditional registration techniques often struggle with challenges such as contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality-specific variations. To address these limitations, we propose a method that integrates learnable edge kernels with learning-based rigid and non-rigid registration techniques. Unlike conventional layers that learn all features without specific bias, our approach begins with a predefined edge detection kernel, which is then perturbed with random noise. These kernels are learned during training to extract optimal edge features tailored to the task. This adaptive edge detection enhances the registration process by capturing diverse structural features critical in medical imaging. To provide clearer insight into the contribution of each component in our design, we introduce four variant models for rigid registration and four variant models for non-rigid registration. We evaluated our approach using a dataset provided by the Medical University across three setups: rigid registration without skull removal, with skull removal, and non-rigid registration. Additionally, we assessed performance on two publicly available datasets. Across all experiments, our method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its potential to improve multi-modal image alignment and anatomical structure analysis.

- **Summary**: The Segmentation Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has proven to be a powerful foundation model for promptable visual object segmentation in both images and videos, capable of storing object-aware memories and transferring them temporally through memory blocks. While SAM2 excels in video object segmentation by providing dense segmentation masks based on prompts, extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) poses challenges due to the need for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and the ability to track multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales. This paper explores the extension of SAM2 for VSS, focusing on two primary approaches and highlighting firsthand observations and common challenges faced during this process. The first approach involves using SAM2 to extract unique objects as masks from a given image, with a segmentation network employed in parallel to generate and refine initial predictions. The second approach utilizes the predicted masks to extract unique feature vectors, which are then fed into a simple network for classification. The resulting classifications and masks are subsequently combined to produce the final segmentation. Our experiments suggest that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall performance in VSS, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.

- **Summary**: The rapid growth of data from satellite-based Earth observation (EO) systems poses significant challenges in data transmission and storage. We evaluate the potential of task-specific learned compression algorithms in this context to reduce data volumes while retaining crucial information. In detail, we compare traditional compression (JPEG 2000) versus a learned compression approach (Discretized Mixed Gaussian Likelihood) on three EO segmentation tasks: Fire, cloud, and building detection. Learned compression notably outperforms JPEG 2000 for large-scale, multi-channel optical imagery in both reconstruction quality (PSNR) and segmentation accuracy. However, traditional codecs remain competitive on smaller, single-channel thermal infrared datasets due to limited data and architectural constraints. Additionally, joint end-to-end optimization of compression and segmentation models does not improve performance over standalone optimization.

- **Summary**: Despite rapid advances in video generative models, robust metrics for evaluating visual and temporal correctness of complex human actions remain elusive. Critically, existing pure-vision encoders and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are strongly appearance-biased, lack temporal understanding, and thus struggle to discern intricate motion dynamics and anatomical implausibilities in generated videos. We tackle this gap by introducing a novel evaluation metric derived from a learned latent space of real-world human actions. Our method first captures the nuances, constraints, and temporal smoothness of real-world motion by fusing appearance-agnostic human skeletal geometry features with appearance-based features. We posit that this combined feature space provides a robust representation of action plausibility. Given a generated video, our metric quantifies its action quality by measuring the distance between its underlying representations and this learned real-world action distribution. For rigorous validation, we develop a new multi-faceted benchmark specifically designed to probe temporally challenging aspects of human action fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our metric achieves substantial improvement of more than 68% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, performs competitively on established external benchmarks, and has a stronger correlation with human perception. Our in-depth analysis reveals critical limitations in current video generative models and establishes a new standard for advanced research in video generation.

- **Summary**: Current multimodal models aim to transcend the limitations of single-modality representations by unifying understanding and generation, often using text-to-image (T2I) tasks to calibrate semantic consistency. However, their reliance on static, single-image generation in training and evaluation leads to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, while fundamentally hindering their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency. This demonstrates that a focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation, promoting static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling-ultimately limiting world knowledge internalization, generation.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where performance on previous tasks degrades after training on a new task. This issue arises due to the model's tendency to overwrite previously acquired knowledge with new information. We present a novel approach to address this challenge, focusing on the intersection of memory-based methods and regularization approaches. We formulate a regularization strategy, termed Information Maximization (IM) regularizer, for memory-based continual learning methods, which is based exclusively on the expected label distribution, thus making it class-agnostic. As a consequence, IM regularizer can be directly integrated into various rehearsal-based continual learning methods, reducing forgetting and favoring faster convergence. Our empirical validation shows that, across datasets and regardless of the number of tasks, our proposed regularization strategy consistently improves baseline performance at the expense of a minimal computational overhead. The lightweight nature of IM ensures that it remains a practical and scalable solution, making it applicable to real-world continual learning scenarios where efficiency is paramount. Finally, we demonstrate the data-agnostic nature of our regularizer by applying it to video data, which presents additional challenges due to its temporal structure and higher memory requirements. Despite the significant domain gap, our experiments show that IM regularizer also improves the performance of video continual learning methods.

- **Summary**: Spatial reasoning, the ability to understand and interpret the 3D structure of the world, is a critical yet underdeveloped capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods predominantly rely on verbal descriptive tuning, which suffers from visual illiteracy, i.e., they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone, devoid of connection to their visual manifestations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MILO, an Implicit spatIaL wOrld modeling paradigm that simulates human-like spatial imagination. MILO integrates a visual generator to provide geometry-aware feedback, thereby implicitly grounding the MLLM's symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience. Complementing this paradigm, we propose RePE (Relative Positional Encoding), a novel encoding scheme that captures relative camera-pose transformations, offering superior performance over absolute coordinate systems. To support the training, we construct GeoGen, a large-scale Geometry-aware Generative dataset with approximately 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering a more holistic understanding of 3D space.

- **Summary**: LLMs and Agents have achieved impressive progress in code generation, mathematical reasoning, and scientific discovery. However, existing benchmarks primarily measure correctness, overlooking the diversity of methods behind solutions. True innovation depends not only on producing correct answers but also on the originality of the approach. We present InnoGym, the first benchmark and framework designed to systematically evaluate the innovation potential of AI agents. InnoGym introduces two complementary metrics: performance gain, which measures improvement over the best-known solutions, and novelty, which captures methodological differences from prior approaches. The benchmark includes 18 carefully curated tasks from real-world engineering and scientific domains, each standardized through resource filtering, evaluator validation, and solution collection. In addition, we provide iGym, a unified execution environment for reproducible and long-horizon evaluations. Extensive experiments show that while some agents produce novel approaches, their lack of robustness limits performance gains. These results highlight a key gap between creativity and effectiveness, underscoring the need for benchmarks that evaluate both.

- **Summary**: Causal thinking enables humans to understand not just what is seen, but why it happens. To replicate this capability in modern AI systems, we introduce the task of visual causal discovery. It requires models to infer cause-and-effect relations among visual entities across diverse scenarios instead of merely perceiving their presence. To this end, we first construct the Visual Causal Graph dataset (VCG-32K), a large-scale collection of over 32,000 images annotated with entity-level causal graphs, and further develop CauSight, a novel vision-language model to perform visual causal discovery through causally aware reasoning. Our training recipe integrates three components: (1) training data curation from VCG-32K, (2) Tree-of-Causal-Thought (ToCT) for synthesizing reasoning trajectories, and (3) reinforcement learning with a designed causal reward to refine the reasoning policy. Experiments show that CauSight outperforms GPT-4.1 on visual causal discovery, achieving over a threefold performance boost (21% absolute gain). Our code, model, and dataset are fully open-sourced at project page: https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/CauSight.

- **Summary**: Recently, two-stage fine-tuning strategies, e.g., acquiring essential driving knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further enhancing decision-making and planning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), have shown strong potential in advancing the knowledge-driven autonomous driving (AD) paradigm. However, the learning nature of SFT still limits the generalization of reasoning, thereby constraining the full potential of driving performance. Meanwhile, current RFT approaches are primarily applied to downstream tasks, since scene understanding is an open-ended problem where corresponding rewards are difficult to quantify. To address these limitations, we propose OpenREAD, an OPEN-ended REasoning reinforced vision-language model (VLM)-based autonomous driving (AD) framework that enables end-to-end RFT across the full spectrum from high-level reasoning to low-level trajectory planning. Specifically, we begin by constructing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations on open-source driving-related knowledge datasets, and employ the powerful Qwen3 large language model (LLM) as the critic in RFT to quantify reasoning quality for open-ended questions during reward modeling. Extensive experiments confirm that joint end-to-end RFT yields substantial improvements in both upstream and downstream tasks, enabling OpenREAD to achieve state-of-the-art performance on reasoning and planning benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Driven by the growing capacity and training scale, Text-to-Video (T2V) generation models have recently achieved substantial progress in video quality, length, and instruction-following capability. However, whether these models can understand physics and generate physically plausible videos remains a question. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used as general-purpose evaluators in various applications, they struggle to identify the physically impossible content from generated videos. To investigate this issue, we construct a \textbf{PID} (\textbf{P}hysical \textbf{I}mplausibility \textbf{D}etection) dataset, which consists of a \textit{test split} of 500 manually annotated videos and a \textit{train split} of 2,588 paired videos, where each implausible video is generated by carefully rewriting the caption of its corresponding real-world video to induce T2V models producing physically implausible content. With the constructed dataset, we introduce a lightweight fine-tuning approach, enabling VLMs to not only detect physically implausible events but also generate textual explanations on the violated physical principles. Taking the fine-tuned VLM as a physical plausibility detector and explainer, namely \textbf{PhyDetEx}, we benchmark a series of state-of-the-art T2V models to assess their adherence to physical laws. Our findings show that although recent T2V models have made notable progress toward generating physically plausible content, understanding and adhering to physical laws remains a challenging issue, especially for open-source models.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration aligns multiple unposed point clouds into a common frame, and is a core step for 3D reconstruction and robot localization. In this work, we cast registration as conditional generation: a learned continuous, point-wise velocity field transports noisy points to a registered scene, from which the pose of each view is recovered. Unlike previous methods that conduct correspondence matching to estimate the transformation between a pair of point clouds and then optimize the pairwise transformations to realize multi-view registration, our model directly generates the registered point cloud. With a lightweight local feature extractor and test-time rigidity enforcement, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on pairwise and multi-view registration benchmarks, particularly with low overlap, and generalizes across scales and sensor modalities. It further supports downstream tasks including relocalization, multi-robot SLAM, and multi-session map merging. Source code available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/RAP.

- **Summary**: Intelligent sports video analysis demands a comprehensive understanding of temporal context, from micro-level actions to macro-level game strategies. Existing end-to-end models often struggle with this temporal hierarchy, offering solutions that lack generalization, incur high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a foundational framework for sports video understanding. In our system, each agent functions as a distinct "cognitive tool" specializing in a specific aspect of analysis. The system's architecture is not confined to a single temporal dimension or task. By leveraging iterative invocation and flexible composition of these agents, our framework can construct adaptive pipelines for both short-term analytic reasoning (e.g., Rally QA) and long-term generative summarization (e.g., match summaries). We demonstrate the adaptability of this framework using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showcasing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization. This work presents a paradigm shift towards a flexible, scalable, and interpretable system for robust, cross-task sports video intelligence.

- **Summary**: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

- **Summary**: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

- **Summary**: We present KM-ViPE (Knowledge Mapping Video Pose Engine), a real-time open-vocabulary SLAM framework for uncalibrated monocular cameras in dynamic environments. Unlike systems requiring depth sensors and offline calibration, KM-ViPE operates directly on raw RGB streams, making it ideal for ego-centric applications and harvesting internet-scale video data for training. KM-ViPE tightly couples DINO visual features with geometric constraints through a high-level features based adaptive robust kernel that handles both moving objects and movable static objects (e.g., moving furniture in ego-centric views). The system performs simultaneous online localization and open-vocabulary semantic mapping by fusing geometric and deep visual features aligned with language embeddings. Our results are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while existing solutions either operate offline, need depth data and/or odometry estimation, or lack dynamic scene robustness. KM-ViPE benefits from internet-scale training and uniquely combines online operation, uncalibrated monocular input, and robust handling of dynamic scenes, which makes it a good fit for autonomous robotics and AR/VR applications and advances practical spatial intelligence capabilities for embodied AI.

- **Summary**: Cross-domain face retargeting requires disentangled control over identity, expressions, and domain-specific stylistic attributes. Existing methods, typically trained on real-world faces, either fail to generalize across domains, need test-time optimizations, or require fine-tuning with carefully curated multi-style datasets to achieve domain-invariant identity representations. In this work, we introduce \textit{StyleYourSmile}, a novel one-shot cross-domain face retargeting method that eliminates the need for curated multi-style paired data. We propose an efficient data augmentation strategy alongside a dual-encoder framework, for extracting domain-invariant identity cues and capturing domain-specific stylistic variations. Leveraging these disentangled control signals, we condition a diffusion model to retarget facial expressions across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{StyleYourSmile} achieves superior identity preservation and retargeting fidelity across a wide range of visual domains.

- **Summary**: Contact-rich robotic manipulation requires representations that encode local geometry. Vision provides global context but lacks direct measurements of properties such as texture and hardness, whereas touch supplies these cues. Modern visuo-tactile sensors capture both modalities in a single fused image, yielding intrinsically aligned inputs that are well suited to manipulation tasks requiring visual and tactile information. Most self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks, however, compress feature maps into a global vector, discarding spatial structure and misaligning with the needs of manipulation. To address this, we propose SARL, a spatially-aware SSL framework that augments the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) architecture with three map-level objectives, including Saliency Alignment (SAL), Patch-Prototype Distribution Alignment (PPDA), and Region Affinity Matching (RAM), to keep attentional focus, part composition, and geometric relations consistent across views. These losses act on intermediate feature maps, complementing the global objective. SARL consistently outperforms nine SSL baselines across six downstream tasks with fused visual-tactile data. On the geometry-sensitive edge-pose regression task, SARL achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3955, a 30% relative improvement over the next-best SSL method (0.5682 MAE) and approaching the supervised upper bound. These findings indicate that, for fused visual-tactile data, the most effective signal is structured spatial equivariance, in which features vary predictably with object geometry, which enables more capable robotic perception.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Medical image registration drives quantitative analysis across organs, modalities, and patient populations. Recent deep learning methods often combine low-level "trend-driven" computational blocks from computer vision, such as large-kernel CNNs, Transformers, and state-space models, with high-level registration-specific designs like motion pyramids, correlation layers, and iterative refinement. Yet, their relative contributions remain unclear and entangled. This raises a central question: should future advances in registration focus on importing generic architectural trends or on refining domain-specific design principles? Through a modular framework spanning brain, lung, cardiac, and abdominal registration, we systematically disentangle the influence of these two paradigms. Our evaluation reveals that low-level "trend-driven" computational blocks offer only marginal or inconsistent gains, while high-level registration-specific designs consistently deliver more accurate, smoother, and more robust deformations. These domain priors significantly elevate the performance of a standard U-Net baseline, far more than variants incorporating "trend-driven" blocks, achieving an average relative improvement of $\sim3\%$. All models and experiments are released within a transparent, modular benchmark that enables plug-and-play comparison for new architectures and registration tasks (https://github.com/BailiangJ/rethink-reg). This dynamic and extensible platform establishes a common ground for reproducible and fair evaluation, inviting the community to isolate genuine methodological contributions from domain priors. Our findings advocate a shift in research emphasis: from following architectural trends to embracing domain-specific design principles as the true drivers of progress in learning-based medical image registration.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are now central to healthcare applications such as medical visual question answering and imaging report generation. Yet, these models remain vulnerable to hallucination outputs that appear plausible but are in fact incorrect. In the natural image domain, several decoding strategies have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by reinforcing visual evidence, but most rely on secondary decoding or rollback procedures that substantially slow inference. Moreover, existing solutions are often domain-specific and may introduce misalignment between modalities or between generated and ground-truth content. We introduce Med-VCD, a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that mitigates hallucinations in medical LVLMs without the time overhead of secondary decoding. Med-VCD incorporates a novel token-sparsification strategy that selects visually informed tokens on the fly, trimming redundancy while retaining critical visual context and thus balancing efficiency with reliability. Evaluations on eight medical datasets, spanning ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology tasks in visual question answering, report generation, and dedicated hallucination benchmarks, show that Med-VCD raises factual accuracy by an average of 13\% and improves hallucination accuracy by 6\% relative to baseline medical LVLMs.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

- **Summary**: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance systems to autonomous driving. However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems.

- **Summary**: Robust robotic manipulation requires reliable failure detection and recovery. Although current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, their accuracy and generalization are limited by the scarcity of failure data. To address this data gap, we propose an automatic robot failure synthesis approach that procedurally perturbs successful trajectories to generate diverse planning and execution failures. This method produces not only binary classification labels but also fine-grained failure categories and step-by-step reasoning traces in both simulation and the real world. With it, we construct three new failure detection benchmarks: RLBench-Fail, BridgeDataV2-Fail, and UR5-Fail, substantially expanding the diversity and scale of existing failure datasets. We then train Guardian, a VLM with multi-view images for detailed failure reasoning and detection. Guardian achieves state-of-the-art performance on both existing and newly introduced benchmarks. It also effectively improves task success rates when integrated into a state-of-the-art manipulation system in simulation and real robots, demonstrating the impact of our generated failure data.

- **Summary**: The rapid growth of visual tokens in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) leads to excessive memory consumption and inference latency, especially when handling high-resolution images and videos. Token pruning is a technique used to mitigate this issue by removing redundancy, but existing methods often ignore relevance to the user query or suffer from the limitations of attention mechanisms, reducing their adaptability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Script, a plug-and-play pruning method that requires no retraining and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Script comprises two modules: a graph-structured pruning module that removes visually redundant tokens, and a query-conditioned semantic pruning module that preserves query-relevant visual information. Together, they enhance performance on multimodal tasks. Experiments on fourteen benchmarks across image and video understanding tasks show that Script consistently achieves higher model efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to existing pruning methods. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, it achieves up to 6.8x prefill speedup and 10x FLOP reduction, while retaining 96.88% of the original performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in video world modeling have enabled large-scale generative models to simulate embodied environments with high visual fidelity, providing strong priors for prediction, planning, and control. Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.

- **Summary**: Modeling and synthesizing complex hand-object interactions remains a significant challenge, even for state-of-the-art physics engines. Conventional simulation-based approaches rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities such as deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or even living creatures. In this paper, we present SpriteHand, an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interaction videos across a wide range of object types and motion patterns. SpriteHand takes as input a static object image and a video stream in which the hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene, and generates corresponding hand-object interaction effects in real time. Our model employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. Our 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with an approximate 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output. Experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, physical plausibility, and interaction fidelity compared to both generative and engine-based baselines.

- **Summary**: Controllable image semantic understanding tasks, such as captioning or segmentation, necessitate users to input a prompt (e.g., text or bounding boxes) to predict a unique outcome, presenting challenges such as high-cost prompt input or limited information output. This paper introduces a new task ``Image Collaborative Segmentation and Captioning'' (SegCaptioning), which aims to translate a straightforward prompt, like a bounding box around an object, into diverse semantic interpretations represented by (caption, masks) pairs, allowing flexible result selection by users. This task poses significant challenges, including accurately capturing a user's intention from a minimal prompt while simultaneously predicting multiple semantically aligned caption words and masks. Technically, we propose a novel Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model that leverages structured scene graph features for correlated mask-caption prediction. Initially, we introduce a Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor to map a user's prompt to a scene graph, effectively capturing his intention. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion process incorporating a Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer to predict correlated caption-mask pairs by uncovering intricate correlations between them. To ensure accurate alignment, we design a Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss to explicitly align visual and textual entities by considering inter-modal similarity, resulting in well-aligned caption-mask pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that SGDiff achieves superior performance in SegCaptioning, yielding promising results for both captioning and segmentation tasks with minimal prompt input.

- **Summary**: GUI grounding aims to align natural language instructions with precise regions in complex user interfaces. Advanced multimodal large language models show strong ability in visual GUI grounding but still struggle with small or visually similar targets and ambiguity in real world layouts. These limitations arise from limited grounding capacity and from underuse of existing reasoning potential. We present Chain of Ground CoG a training free multi step grounding framework that uses multimodal large language models for iterative visual reasoning and refinement. Instead of direct prediction the model progressively reflects and adjusts its hypotheses leading to more accurate and interpretable localization. Our approach achieves 68.4 accuracy on the ScreenSpot Pro benchmark an improvement of 4.8 points. To measure real world generalization we introduce TPanel UI a dataset of 420 labeled industrial control panels with visual distortions such as blur and masking. On TPanel UI Chain of Ground improves over the strong baseline Qwen3 VL 235B by 6.9 points showing the effectiveness of multi step training free grounding across real world and digital interfaces. These results highlight a direction for unlocking grounding potential through structured iterative refinement instead of additional training.

- **Summary**: Recent reinforcement-learning frameworks for visual perception policy have begun to incorporate intermediate reasoning chains expressed in natural language. Empirical observations indicate that such purely linguistic intermediate reasoning often reduces performance on perception tasks. We argue that the core issue lies not in reasoning per se but in the form of reasoning: while these chains perform semantic reasoning in an unstructured linguistic space, visual perception requires reasoning in a spatial and object-centric space. In response, we introduce Artemis, a perception-policy learning framework that performs structured proposal-based reasoning, where each intermediate step is represented as a (label, bounding-box) pair capturing a verifiable visual state. This design enables explicit tracking of intermediate states, direct supervision for proposal quality, and avoids ambiguity introduced by language-based reasoning. Artemis is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, achieves strong performance on grounding and detection task and exhibits substantial generalization to counting and geometric-perception tasks. The consistent improvements across these diverse settings confirm that aligning reasoning with spatial representations enhances perception-policy learning. Owing to its strengthened visual reasoning, Artemis also achieves competitive performance on general MLLM benchmarks, illustrating that spatially grounded reasoning provides a principled route toward scalable and general perception policies.

- **Summary**: Physical AI aims to develop models that can perceive and predict real-world dynamics; yet, the extent to which current multi-modal large language models and video generative models support these abilities is insufficiently understood. We introduce Physical AI Bench (PAI-Bench), a unified and comprehensive benchmark that evaluates perception and prediction capabilities across video generation, conditional video generation, and video understanding, comprising 2,808 real-world cases with task-aligned metrics designed to capture physical plausibility and domain-specific reasoning. Our study provides a systematic assessment of recent models and shows that video generative models, despite strong visual fidelity, often struggle to maintain physically coherent dynamics, while multi-modal large language models exhibit limited performance in forecasting and causal interpretation. These observations suggest that current systems are still at an early stage in handling the perceptual and predictive demands of Physical AI. In summary, PAI-Bench establishes a realistic foundation for evaluating Physical AI and highlights key gaps that future systems must address.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving policies are typically trained via open-loop behavior cloning of human demonstrations. However, such policies suffer from covariate shift when deployed in closed loop, leading to compounding errors. We introduce Rollouts as Demonstrations (RoaD), a simple and efficient method to mitigate covariate shift by leveraging the policy's own closed-loop rollouts as additional training data. During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, producing informative yet realistic demonstrations for fine-tuning. This approach enables robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than reinforcement learning, and avoids restrictive assumptions of prior closed-loop supervised fine-tuning (CL-SFT) methods, allowing broader applications domains including end-to-end driving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoaD on WOSAC, a large-scale traffic simulation benchmark, where it performs similar or better than the prior CL-SFT method; and in AlpaSim, a high-fidelity neural reconstruction-based simulator for end-to-end driving, where it improves driving score by 41\% and reduces collisions by 54\%.

- **Summary**: We introduce Audio-Visual Affordance Grounding (AV-AG), a new task that segments object interaction regions from action sounds. Unlike existing approaches that rely on textual instructions or demonstration videos, which often limited by ambiguity or occlusion, audio provides real-time, semantically rich, and visually independent cues for affordance grounding, enabling more intuitive understanding of interaction regions. To support this task, we construct the first AV-AG dataset, comprising a large collection of action sounds, object images, and pixel-level affordance annotations. The dataset also includes an unseen subset to evaluate zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we propose AVAGFormer, a model equipped with a semantic-conditioned cross-modal mixer and a dual-head decoder that effectively fuses audio and visual signals for mask prediction. Experiments show that AVAGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on AV-AG, surpassing baselines from related tasks. Comprehensive analyses highlight the distinctions between AV-AG and AVS, the benefits of end-to-end modeling, and the contribution of each component. Code and dataset have been released on https://jscslld.github.io/AVAGFormer/.

In this work, we present MV-TAP, a novel point tracker that tracks points across multi-view videos of dynamic scenes by leveraging cross-view information. MV-TAP utilizes camera geometry and a cross-view attention mechanism to aggregate spatio-temporal information across views, enabling more complete and reliable trajectory estimation in multi-view videos. To support this task, we construct a large-scale synthetic training dataset and real-world evaluation sets tailored for multi-view tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MV-TAP outperforms existing point-tracking methods on challenging benchmarks, establishing an effective baseline for advancing research in multi-view point tracking.

- **Summary**: The field of 360-degree omnidirectional understanding has been receiving increasing attention for advancing spatial intelligence. However, the lack of large-scale and diverse data remains a major limitation. In this work, we propose AirSim360, a simulation platform for omnidirectional data from aerial viewpoints, enabling wide-ranging scene sampling with drones. Specifically, AirSim360 focuses on three key aspects: a render-aligned data and labeling paradigm for pixel-level geometric, semantic, and entity-level understanding; an interactive pedestrian-aware system for modeling human behavior; and an automated trajectory generation paradigm to support navigation tasks. Furthermore, we collect more than 60K panoramic samples and conduct extensive experiments across various tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our simulator. Unlike existing simulators, our work is the first to systematically model the 4D real world under an omnidirectional setting. The entire platform, including the toolkit, plugins, and collected datasets, will be made publicly available at https://insta360-research-team.github.io/AirSim360-website.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: MeanFlow (MF) has recently been established as a framework for one-step generative modeling. However, its ``fastforward'' nature introduces key challenges in both the training objective and the guidance mechanism. First, the original MF's training target depends not only on the underlying ground-truth fields but also on the network itself. To address this issue, we recast the objective as a loss on the instantaneous velocity $v$, re-parameterized by a network that predicts the average velocity $u$. Our reformulation yields a more standard regression problem and improves the training stability. Second, the original MF fixes the classifier-free guidance scale during training, which sacrifices flexibility. We tackle this issue by formulating guidance as explicit conditioning variables, thereby retaining flexibility at test time. The diverse conditions are processed through in-context conditioning, which reduces model size and benefits performance. Overall, our $\textbf{improved MeanFlow}$ ($\textbf{iMF}$) method, trained entirely from scratch, achieves $\textbf{1.72}$ FID with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256$\times$256. iMF substantially outperforms prior methods of this kind and closes the gap with multi-step methods while using no distillation. We hope our work will further advance fastforward generative modeling as a stand-alone paradigm.

- **Summary**: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) aim to jointly perform multimodal understanding and generation within a single framework. We present TUNA, a native UMM that builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This unified representation space allows end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks. Compared to prior UMMs with decoupled representations, TUNA's unified visual space avoids representation format mismatches introduced by separate encoders, outperforming decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation. Moreover, we observe that stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks, highlighting the importance of the representation encoder. Finally, in this unified setting, jointly training on both understanding and generation data allows the two tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere. Our extensive experiments on multimodal understanding and generation benchmarks show that TUNA achieves state-of-the-art results in image and video understanding, image and video generation, and image editing, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of its unified representation design.

- **Summary**: Camera and object motions are central to a video's narrative. However, precisely editing these captured motions remains a significant challenge, especially under complex object movements. Current motion-controlled image-to-video (I2V) approaches often lack full-scene context for consistent video editing, while video-to-video (V2V) methods provide viewpoint changes or basic object translation, but offer limited control over fine-grained object motion. We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preserving spatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolve depth order and handle occlusions for precise motion editing. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data, our model supports diverse motion edits, including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation, unlocking new creative potential in video editing.

- **Summary**: Video generators are increasingly evaluated as potential world models, which requires them to encode and understand physical laws. We investigate their representation of a fundamental law: gravity. Out-of-the-box video generators consistently generate objects falling at an effectively slower acceleration. However, these physical tests are often confounded by ambiguous metric scale. We first investigate if observed physical errors are artifacts of these ambiguities (e.g., incorrect frame rate assumptions). We find that even temporal rescaling cannot correct the high-variance gravity artifacts. To rigorously isolate the underlying physical representation from these confounds, we introduce a unit-free, two-object protocol that tests the timing ratio $t_1^2/t_2^2 = h_1/h_2$, a relationship independent of $g$, focal length, and scale. This relative test reveals violations of Galileo's equivalence principle. We then demonstrate that this physical gap can be partially mitigated with targeted specialization. A lightweight low-rank adaptor fine-tuned on only 100 single-ball clips raises $g_{\mathrm{eff}}$ from $1.81\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ to $6.43\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ (reaching $65\%$ of terrestrial gravity). This specialist adaptor also generalizes zero-shot to two-ball drops and inclined planes, offering initial evidence that specific physical laws can be corrected with minimal data.

- **Summary**: Self-driving laboratories offer a promising path toward reducing the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often irreproducible workflows in the biological sciences. Yet their stringent precision requirements demand highly robust models whose training relies on large amounts of annotated data. However, this kind of data is difficult to obtain in routine practice, especially negative samples. In this work, we focus on pipetting, the most critical and precision sensitive action in SDLs. To overcome the scarcity of training data, we build a hybrid pipeline that fuses real and virtual data generation. The real track adopts a human-in-the-loop scheme that couples automated acquisition with selective human verification to maximize accuracy with minimal effort. The virtual track augments the real data using reference-conditioned, prompt-guided image generation, which is further screened and validated for reliability. Together, these two tracks yield a class-balanced dataset that enables robust bubble detection training. On a held-out real test set, a model trained entirely on automatically acquired real images reaches 99.6% accuracy, and mixing real and generated data during training sustains 99.4% accuracy while reducing collection and review load. Our approach offers a scalable and cost-effective strategy for supplying visual feedback data to SDL workflows and provides a practical solution to data scarcity in rare event detection and broader vision tasks.

- **Summary**: Today, people can easily record memorable moments, ranging from concerts, sports events, lectures, family gatherings, and birthday parties with multiple consumer cameras. However, synchronizing these cross-camera streams remains challenging. Existing methods assume controlled settings, specific targets, manual correction, or costly hardware. We present VisualSync, an optimization framework based on multi-view dynamics that aligns unposed, unsynchronized videos at millisecond accuracy. Our key insight is that any moving 3D point, when co-visible in two cameras, obeys epipolar constraints once properly synchronized. To exploit this, VisualSync leverages off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences. It then jointly minimizes the epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset. Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show that VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving an median synchronization error below 50 ms.

- **Summary**: Generative modeling has recently shown remarkable promise for visuomotor policy learning, enabling flexible and expressive control across diverse embodied AI tasks. However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI.

- **Summary**: We introduce Material Coating, a novel image editing task that simulates applying a thin material layer onto an object while preserving its underlying coarse and fine geometry. Material coating is fundamentally different from existing "material transfer" methods, which are designed to replace an object's intrinsic material, often overwriting fine details. To address this new task, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset (110K images) of 3D objects with varied, physically-based coatings, named DataCoat110K. We then propose CoatFusion, a novel architecture that enables this task by conditioning a diffusion model on both a 2D albedo texture and granular, PBR-style parametric controls, including roughness, metalness, transmission, and a key thickness parameter. Experiments and user studies show CoatFusion produces realistic, controllable coatings and significantly outperforms existing material editing and transfer methods on this new task.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

- **Summary**: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

- **Summary**: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

- **Summary**: Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.   Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).   Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.

- **Summary**: Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats. This work represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

- **Summary**: Phishing remains one of the most prevalent online threats, exploiting human trust to harvest sensitive credentials. Existing URL- and HTML-based detection systems struggle against obfuscation and visual deception. This paper presents \textbf{PhishSnap}, a privacy-preserving, on-device phishing detection system leveraging perceptual hashing (pHash). Implemented as a browser extension, PhishSnap captures webpage screenshots, computes visual hashes, and compares them against legitimate templates to identify visually similar phishing attempts. A \textbf{2024 dataset of 10,000 URLs} (70\%/20\%/10\% train/validation/test) was collected from PhishTank and Netcraft. Due to security takedowns, a subset of phishing pages was unavailable, reducing dataset diversity. The system achieved \textbf{0.79 accuracy}, \textbf{0.76 precision}, and \textbf{0.78 recall}, showing that visual similarity remains a viable anti-phishing measure. The entire inference process occurs locally, ensuring user privacy and minimal latency.

- **Summary**: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

- **Summary**: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fun- damentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self- monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non- adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust general- ization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.
