- **Summary**: The rapid progress in deep generative models has led to the creation of incredibly realistic synthetic images that are becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from real-world data. The widespread use of Variational Models, Diffusion Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks has made it easier to generate convincing fake images and videos, which poses significant challenges for detecting and mitigating the spread of misinformation. As a result, developing effective methods for detecting AI-generated fakes has become a pressing concern. In our research, we propose HFMF, a comprehensive two-stage deepfake detection framework that leverages both hierarchical cross-modal feature fusion and multi-stream feature extraction to enhance detection performance against imagery produced by state-of-the-art generative AI models. The first component of our approach integrates vision Transformers and convolutional nets through a hierarchical feature fusion mechanism. The second component of our framework combines object-level information and a fine-tuned convolutional net model. We then fuse the outputs from both components via an ensemble deep neural net, enabling robust classification performances. We demonstrate that our architecture achieves superior performance across diverse dataset benchmarks while maintaining calibration and interoperability.

- **Summary**: LiDAR and photogrammetry are active and passive remote sensing techniques for point cloud acquisition, respectively, offering complementary advantages and heterogeneous. Due to the fundamental differences in sensing mechanisms, spatial distributions and coordinate systems, their point clouds exhibit significant discrepancies in density, precision, noise, and overlap. Coupled with the lack of ground truth for large-scale scenes, integrating the heterogeneous point clouds is a highly challenging task. This paper proposes a self-supervised registration network based on a masked autoencoder, focusing on heterogeneous LiDAR and photogrammetric point clouds. At its core, the method introduces a multi-scale masked training strategy to extract robust features from heterogeneous point clouds under self-supervision. To further enhance registration performance, a rotation-translation embedding module is designed to effectively capture the key features essential for accurate rigid transformations. Building upon the robust representations, a transformer-based architecture seamlessly integrates local and global features, fostering precise alignment across diverse point cloud datasets. The proposed method demonstrates strong feature extraction capabilities for both LiDAR and photogrammetric point clouds, addressing the challenges of acquiring ground truth at the scene level. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving heterogeneous point cloud registration problems.

- **Summary**: Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) typically involves learning common representations to directly measure similarities between multimodal samples. Most existing CMR methods commonly assume multimodal samples in pairs and employ joint training to learn common representations, limiting the flexibility of CMR. Although some methods adopt independent training strategies for each modality to improve flexibility in CMR, they utilize the randomly initialized orthogonal matrices to guide representation learning, which is suboptimal since they assume inter-class samples are independent of each other, limiting the potential of semantic alignments between sample representations and ground-truth labels. To address these issues, we propose a novel method termed Deep Reversible Consistency Learning (DRCL) for cross-modal retrieval. DRCL includes two core modules, \ie Selective Prior Learning (SPL) and Reversible Semantic Consistency learning (RSC). More specifically, SPL first learns a transformation weight matrix on each modality and selects the best one based on the quality score as the Prior, which greatly avoids blind selection of priors learned from low-quality modalities. Then, RSC employs a Modality-invariant Representation Recasting mechanism (MRR) to recast the potential modality-invariant representations from sample semantic labels by the generalized inverse matrix of the prior. Since labels are devoid of modal-specific information, we utilize the recast features to guide the representation learning, thus maintaining semantic consistency to the fullest extent possible. In addition, a feature augmentation mechanism (FA) is introduced in RSC to encourage the model to learn over a wider data distribution for diversity. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on five widely used datasets and comparisons with 15 state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our DRCL.

- **Summary**: Scene Graph Generation(SGG) is a scene understanding task that aims at identifying object entities and reasoning their relationships within a given image. In contrast to prevailing two-stage methods based on a large object detector (e.g., Faster R-CNN), one-stage methods integrate a fixed-size set of learnable queries to jointly reason relational triplets <subject, predicate, object>. This paradigm demonstrates robust performance with significantly reduced parameters and computational overhead. However, the challenge in one-stage methods stems from the issue of weak entanglement, wherein entities involved in relationships require both coupled features shared within triplets and decoupled visual features. Previous methods either adopt a single decoder for coupled triplet feature modeling or multiple decoders for separate visual feature extraction but fail to consider both. In this paper, we introduce UniQ, a Unified decoder with task-specific Queries architecture, where task-specific queries generate decoupled visual features for subjects, objects, and predicates respectively, and unified decoder enables coupled feature modeling within relational triplets. Experimental results on the Visual Genome dataset demonstrate that UniQ has superior performance to both one-stage and two-stage methods.

- **Summary**: The bio-inspired event camera has garnered extensive research attention in recent years, owing to its significant potential derived from its high dynamic range and low latency characteristics. Similar to the standard camera, the event camera requires precise intrinsic calibration to facilitate further high-level visual applications, such as pose estimation and mapping. While several calibration methods for event cameras have been proposed, most of them are either (i) engineering-driven, heavily relying on conventional image-based calibration pipelines, or (ii) inconvenient, requiring complex instrumentation. To this end, we propose an accurate and convenient intrinsic calibration method for event cameras, named eKalibr, which builds upon a carefully designed event-based circle grid pattern recognition algorithm. To extract target patterns from events, we perform event-based normal flow estimation to identify potential events generated by circle edges, and cluster them spatially. Subsequently, event clusters associated with the same grid circles are matched and grouped using normal flows, for subsequent time-varying ellipse estimation. Fitted ellipse centers are time-synchronized, for final grid pattern recognition. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of eKalibr in terms of pattern extraction and intrinsic calibration. The implementation of eKalibr is open-sourced at (https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Previous studies have pointed out that visual question answering (VQA) models are prone to relying on language priors for answer predictions. In this context, predictions often depend on linguistic shortcuts rather than a comprehensive grasp of multimodal knowledge, which diminishes their generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely, KDAR, leveraging knowledge distillation to address the prior-dependency dilemmas within the VQA task. Specifically, the regularization effect facilitated by soft labels from a well-trained teacher is employed to penalize overfitting to the most common answers. The soft labels, which serve a regularization role, also provide semantic guidance that narrows the range of candidate answers. Additionally, we design an adaptive sample-wise reweighting learning strategy to further mitigate bias by dynamically adjusting the importance of each sample. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances performance in both OOD and IID settings. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VQA-CPv2 out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Recent research shows that emotions can enhance users' cognition and influence information communication. While research on visual emotion analysis is extensive, limited work has been done on helping users generate emotionally rich image content. Existing work on emotional image generation relies on discrete emotion categories, making it challenging to capture complex and subtle emotional nuances accurately. Additionally, these methods struggle to control the specific content of generated images based on text prompts. In this work, we introduce the new task of continuous emotional image content generation (C-EICG) and present EmotiCrafter, an emotional image generation model that generates images based on text prompts and Valence-Arousal values. Specifically, we propose a novel emotion-embedding mapping network that embeds Valence-Arousal values into textual features, enabling the capture of specific emotions in alignment with intended input prompts. Additionally, we introduce a loss function to enhance emotion expression. The experimental results show that our method effectively generates images representing specific emotions with the desired content and outperforms existing techniques.



### From My View to Yours: Ego-Augmented Learning in Large Vision Language Models for Understanding Exocentric Daily Living Activities

- **Summary**: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video understanding, yet their adoption for Activities of Daily Living (ADL) remains limited by their inability to capture fine-grained interactions and spatial relationships. This limitation is particularly evident in ADL tasks, where understanding detailed human-object interaction and human-centric motion is crucial for applications such as elderly monitoring and cognitive assessment. To address this, we aim to leverage the complementary nature of egocentric views to enhance LVLM's understanding of exocentric ADL videos. Consequently, we propose an online ego2exo distillation approach to learn ego-augmented exo representations in LVLMs. While effective, this approach requires paired ego-exo training data, which is impractical to collect for real-world ADL scenarios. Consequently, we develop EgoMimic, a skeleton-guided method that can generate mimicked ego views from exocentric videos. We find that the exo representations of our ego-augmented LVLMs successfully learn to extract ego-perspective cues, demonstrated through comprehensive evaluation on six ADL benchmarks and our proposed EgoPerceptionMCQ benchmark designed specifically to assess egocentric understanding from exocentric videos. Code, models, and data will be open-sourced at https://github.com/dominickrei/EgoExo4ADL.

- **Summary**: The recent widespread adoption of drones for studying marine animals provides opportunities for deriving biological information from aerial imagery. The large scale of imagery data acquired from drones is well suited for machine learning (ML) analysis. Development of ML models for analyzing marine animal aerial imagery has followed the classical paradigm of training, testing, and deploying a new model for each dataset, requiring significant time, human effort, and ML expertise. We introduce Frame Level ALIgment and tRacking (FLAIR), which leverages the video understanding of Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and the vision-language capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). FLAIR takes a drone video as input and outputs segmentation masks of the species of interest across the video. Notably, FLAIR leverages a zero-shot approach, eliminating the need for labeled data, training a new model, or fine-tuning an existing model to generalize to other species. With a dataset of 18,000 drone images of Pacific nurse sharks, we trained state-of-the-art object detection models to compare against FLAIR. We show that FLAIR massively outperforms these object detectors and performs competitively against two human-in-the-loop methods for prompting SAM2, achieving a Dice score of 0.81. FLAIR readily generalizes to other shark species without additional human effort and can be combined with novel heuristics to automatically extract relevant information including length and tailbeat frequency. FLAIR has significant potential to accelerate aerial imagery analysis workflows, requiring markedly less human effort and expertise than traditional machine learning workflows, while achieving superior accuracy. By reducing the effort required for aerial imagery analysis, FLAIR allows scientists to spend more time interpreting results and deriving insights about marine ecosystems.

- **Summary**: Attribute classification is crucial for identifying specific characteristics within image regions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been effective in zero-shot tasks by leveraging their general knowledge from large-scale datasets. Recent studies demonstrate that transformer-based models with class-wise queries can effectively address zero-shot multi-label classification. However, poor utilization of the relationship between seen and unseen attributes makes the model lack generalizability. Additionally, attribute classification generally involves many attributes, making maintaining the model's scalability difficult. To address these issues, we propose Super-class guided transFormer (SugaFormer), a novel framework that leverages super-classes to enhance scalability and generalizability for zero-shot attribute classification. SugaFormer employs Super-class Query Initialization (SQI) to reduce the number of queries, utilizing common semantic information from super-classes, and incorporates Multi-context Decoding (MD) to handle diverse visual cues. To strengthen generalizability, we introduce two knowledge transfer strategies that utilize VLMs. During training, Super-class guided Consistency Regularization (SCR) aligns SugaFormer's features with VLMs using region-specific prompts, and during inference, Zero-shot Retrieval-based Score Enhancement (ZRSE) refines predictions for unseen attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SugaFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across three widely-used attribute classification benchmarks under zero-shot, and cross-dataset transfer settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/SugaFormer.

- **Summary**: The application of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in Autonomous Driving (AD) faces significant challenges due to their limited training on traffic-specific data and the absence of dedicated benchmarks for spatiotemporal understanding. This study addresses these issues by proposing TB-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs on understanding traffic behaviors across eight perception tasks from ego-centric views. We also introduce vision-language instruction tuning datasets, TB-100k and TB-250k, along with simple yet effective baselines for the tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show that existing MLLMs underperform in these tasks, with even a powerful model like GPT-4o achieving less than 35% accuracy on average. In contrast, when fine-tuned with TB-100k or TB-250k, our baseline models achieve average accuracy up to 85%, significantly enhancing performance on the tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate performance transfer by co-training TB-100k with another traffic dataset, leading to improved performance on the latter. Overall, this study represents a step forward by introducing a comprehensive benchmark, high-quality datasets, and baselines, thus supporting the gradual integration of MLLMs into the perception, prediction, and planning stages of AD.

- **Summary**: Video restoration plays a pivotal role in revitalizing degraded video content by rectifying imperfections caused by various degradations introduced during capturing (sensor noise, motion blur, etc.), saving/sharing (compression, resizing, etc.) and editing. This paper introduces a novel algorithm designed for scenarios where noise is introduced during video capture, aiming to enhance the visual quality of videos by reducing unwanted noise artifacts. We propose the Latent space LSTM Video Denoiser (LLVD), an end-to-end blind denoising model. LLVD uniquely combines spatial and temporal feature extraction, employing Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) within the encoded feature domain. This integration of LSTM layers is crucial for maintaining continuity and minimizing flicker in the restored video. Moreover, processing frames in the encoded feature domain significantly reduces computations, resulting in a very lightweight architecture. LLVD's blind nature makes it versatile for real, in-the-wild denoising scenarios where prior information about noise characteristics is not available. Experiments reveal that LLVD demonstrates excellent performance for both synthetic and captured noise. Specifically, LLVD surpasses the current State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) in RAW denoising by 0.3dB, while also achieving a 59\% reduction in computational complexity.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been a surge of research focused on underwater image enhancement using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), driven by the need to overcome the challenges posed by underwater environments. Issues such as light attenuation, scattering, and color distortion severely degrade the quality of underwater images, limiting their use in critical applications. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing underwater photos due to their ability to learn complex transformations and generate realistic outputs. These advancements have been applied to real-world applications, including marine biology and ecosystem monitoring, coral reef health assessment, underwater archaeology, and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation. This paper explores all major approaches to underwater image enhancement, from physical and physics-free models to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models and state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. It provides a comprehensive analysis of these methods, evaluation metrics, datasets, and loss functions, offering a holistic view of the field. Furthermore, the paper delves into the limitations and challenges faced by current methods, such as generalization issues, high computational demands, and dataset biases, while suggesting potential directions for future research.

- **Summary**: Intelligent embodied agents (e.g. robots) need to perform complex semantic tasks in unfamiliar environments. Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.

- **Summary**: We present LocoGS, a locality-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework that exploits the spatial coherence of 3D Gaussians for compact modeling of volumetric scenes. To this end, we first analyze the local coherence of 3D Gaussian attributes, and propose a novel locality-aware 3D Gaussian representation that effectively encodes locally-coherent Gaussian attributes using a neural field representation with a minimal storage requirement. On top of the novel representation, LocoGS is carefully designed with additional components such as dense initialization, an adaptive spherical harmonics bandwidth scheme and different encoding schemes for different Gaussian attributes to maximize compression performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the rendering quality of existing compact Gaussian representations for representative real-world 3D datasets while achieving from 54.6$\times$ to 96.6$\times$ compressed storage size and from 2.1$\times$ to 2.4$\times$ rendering speed than 3DGS. Even our approach also demonstrates an averaged 2.4$\times$ higher rendering speed than the state-of-the-art compression method with comparable compression performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large reconstruction and generative models have significantly improved scene reconstruction and novel view generation. However, due to compute limitations, each inference with these large models is confined to a small area, making long-range consistent scene generation challenging. To address this, we propose StarGen, a novel framework that employs a pre-trained video diffusion model in an autoregressive manner for long-range scene generation. The generation of each video clip is conditioned on the 3D warping of spatially adjacent images and the temporally overlapping image from previously generated clips, improving spatiotemporal consistency in long-range scene generation with precise pose control. The spatiotemporal condition is compatible with various input conditions, facilitating diverse tasks, including sparse view interpolation, perpetual view generation, and layout-conditioned city generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate StarGen's superior scalability, fidelity, and pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly improved their fine-grained perception of single images and general comprehension across multiple images. However, existing MLLMs still face challenges in achieving precise grounding in complex multi-image scenarios. To address this, we first explore a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework that integrates single-image grounding with multi-image comprehension. While partially effective, it remains unstable and struggles to capture abstract visual information due to its non-end-to-end nature. Therefore, we introduce Migician, the first multi-image grounding model capable of performing free-form and accurate grounding across multiple images. To support this, we present the MGrounding-630k dataset, which comprises data for several multi-image grounding tasks derived from existing datasets, along with newly generated free-form grounding instruction-following data. Furthermore, we propose MIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating multi-image grounding capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves significantly superior multi-image grounding capabilities, outperforming the best existing MLLMs by 21.61% and even surpassing much larger 70B models.

- **Summary**: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging technique, which has been widely used in the fields of industrial inspection, medical monitoring and tactile sensing. However, due to the inherent non-linearity and ill-conditioned nature of the EIT inverse problem, the reconstructed image is highly sensitive to the measured data, and random noise artifacts often appear in the reconstructed image, which greatly limits the application of EIT. To address this issue, a conditional diffusion model with voltage consistency (CDMVC) is proposed in this study. The method consists of a pre-imaging module, a conditional diffusion model for reconstruction, a forward voltage constraint network and a scheme of voltage consistency constraint during sampling process. The pre-imaging module is employed to generate the initial reconstruction. This serves as a condition for training the conditional diffusion model. Finally, based on the forward voltage constraint network, a voltage consistency constraint is implemented in the sampling phase to incorporate forward information of EIT, thereby enhancing imaging quality. A more complete dataset, including both common and complex concave shapes, is generated. The proposed method is validated using both simulation and physical experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improves the quality of reconstructed images. In addition, experimental results also demonstrate that our method has good robustness and generalization performance.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based models have shown great promise in real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), but often generate content with structural errors and spurious texture details due to the empirical priors and illusions of these models. To address this issue, we introduce StructSR, a simple, effective, and plug-and-play method that enhances structural fidelity and suppresses spurious details for diffusion-based Real-ISR. StructSR operates without the need for additional fine-tuning, external model priors, or high-level semantic knowledge. At its core is the Structure-Aware Screening (SAS) mechanism, which identifies the image with the highest structural similarity to the low-resolution (LR) input in the early inference stage, allowing us to leverage it as a historical structure knowledge to suppress the generation of spurious details. By intervening in the diffusion inference process, StructSR seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion-based Real-ISR models. Our experimental results demonstrate that StructSR significantly improves the fidelity of structure and texture, improving the PSNR and SSIM metrics by an average of 5.27% and 9.36% on a synthetic dataset (DIV2K-Val) and 4.13% and 8.64% on two real-world datasets (RealSR and DRealSR) when integrated with four state-of-the-art diffusion-based Real-ISR methods.

- **Summary**: In recent research, adversarial attacks on person detectors using patches or static 3D model-based texture modifications have struggled with low success rates due to the flexible nature of human movement. Modeling the 3D deformations caused by various actions has been a major challenge. Fortunately, advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for dynamic human modeling offer new possibilities. In this paper, we introduce UV-Attack, a groundbreaking approach that achieves high success rates even with extensive and unseen human actions. We address the challenge above by leveraging dynamic-NeRF-based UV mapping. UV-Attack can generate human images across diverse actions and viewpoints, and even create novel actions by sampling from the SMPL parameter space. While dynamic NeRF models are capable of modeling human bodies, modifying clothing textures is challenging because they are embedded in neural network parameters. To tackle this, UV-Attack generates UV maps instead of RGB images and modifies the texture stacks. This approach enables real-time texture edits and makes the attack more practical. We also propose a novel Expectation over Pose Transformation loss (EoPT) to improve the evasion success rate on unseen poses and views. Our experiments show that UV-Attack achieves a 92.75% attack success rate against the FastRCNN model across varied poses in dynamic video settings, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art AdvCamou attack, which only had a 28.50% ASR. Moreover, we achieve 49.5% ASR on the latest YOLOv8 detector in black-box settings. This work highlights the potential of dynamic NeRF-based UV mapping for creating more effective adversarial attacks on person detectors, addressing key challenges in modeling human movement and texture modification.

- **Summary**: Cancelable Biometrics (CB) stands for a range of biometric transformation schemes combining biometrics with user specific tokens to generate secure templates. Required properties are the irreversibility, unlikability and recognition accuracy of templates while making their revocation possible. In biometrics, a key-binding scheme is used for protecting a cryptographic key using a biometric data. The key can be recomputed only if a correct biometric data is acquired during authentication. Applications of key-binding schemes are typically disk encryption, where the cryptographic key is used to encrypt and decrypt the disk. In this paper, we cryptanalyze a recent key-binding scheme, called Cancelable Biometrics Vault (CBV) based on cancelable biometrics. More precisely, the introduced cancelable transformation, called BioEncoding scheme, for instantiating the CBV framework is attacked in terms of reversibility and linkability of templates. Subsequently, our linkability attack enables to recover the key in the vault without additional assumptions. Our cryptanalysis introduces a new perspective by uncovering the CBV scheme's revocability and linkability vulnerabilities, which were not previously identified in comparable biometric-based key-binding schemes.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models excel in generative tasks, but aligning them with specific objectives while maintaining their versatility remains challenging. Existing fine-tuning methods often suffer from reward over-optimization, while approximate guidance approaches fail to optimize target rewards effectively. Addressing these limitations, we propose a training-free sampling method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution. Our approach, tailored for diffusion sampling and incorporating tempering techniques, achieves comparable or superior target rewards to fine-tuning methods while preserving diversity and cross-reward generalization. We demonstrate its effectiveness in single-reward optimization, multi-objective scenarios, and online black-box optimization. This work offers a robust solution for aligning diffusion models with diverse downstream objectives without compromising their general capabilities.

- **Summary**: We introduce PersonaHOI, a training- and tuning-free framework that fuses a general StableDiffusion model with a personalized face diffusion (PFD) model to generate identity-consistent human-object interaction (HOI) images. While existing PFD models have advanced significantly, they often overemphasize facial features at the expense of full-body coherence, PersonaHOI introduces an additional StableDiffusion (SD) branch guided by HOI-oriented text inputs. By incorporating cross-attention constraints in the PFD branch and spatial merging at both latent and residual levels, PersonaHOI preserves personalized facial details while ensuring interactive non-facial regions. Experiments, validated by a novel interaction alignment metric, demonstrate the superior realism and scalability of PersonaHOI, establishing a new standard for practical personalized face with HOI generation.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision loss, particularly in India, where access to retina specialists is limited in rural areas. This study aims to evaluate the Artificial Intelligence-based Diabetic Retinopathy Screening System (AIDRSS) for DR detection and prevalence assessment, addressing the growing need for scalable, automated screening solutions in resource-limited settings.   Approach: A multicentric, cross-sectional study was conducted in Kolkata, India, involving 5,029 participants and 10,058 macula-centric retinal fundus images. The AIDRSS employed a deep learning algorithm with 50 million trainable parameters, integrated with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) preprocessing for enhanced image quality. DR was graded using the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy (ICDR) Scale, categorizing disease into five stages (DR0 to DR4). Statistical metrics including sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence rates were evaluated against expert retina specialist assessments.   Results: The prevalence of DR in the general population was 13.7%, rising to 38.2% among individuals with elevated random blood glucose levels. The AIDRSS achieved an overall sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 88%, and 100% sensitivity for detecting referable DR (DR3 and DR4). These results demonstrate the system's robust performance in accurately identifying and grading DR in a diverse population.   Conclusions: AIDRSS provides a reliable, scalable solution for early DR detection in resource-constrained environments. Its integration of advanced AI techniques ensures high diagnostic accuracy, with potential to significantly reduce the burden of diabetes-related vision loss in underserved regions.

- **Summary**: Traditional ultrasound simulators solve the wave equation to model pressure distribution fields, achieving high accuracy but requiring significant computational time and resources. To address this, ray tracing approaches have been introduced, modeling wave propagation as rays interacting with boundaries and scatterers. However, existing models simplify ray propagation, generating echoes at interaction points without considering return paths to the sensor. This can result in unrealistic artifacts and necessitates careful scene tuning for plausible results. We propose a novel ultrasound simulation pipeline that utilizes a ray tracing algorithm to generate echo data, tracing each ray from the transducer through the scene and back to the sensor. To replicate advanced ultrasound imaging, we introduce a ray emission scheme optimized for plane wave imaging, incorporating delay and steering capabilities. Furthermore, we integrate a standard signal processing pipeline to simulate end-to-end ultrasound image formation. We showcase the efficacy of the proposed pipeline by modeling synthetic scenes featuring highly reflective objects, such as bones. In doing so, our proposed approach, UltraRay, not only enhances the overall visual quality but also improves the realism of the simulated images by accurately capturing secondary reflections and reducing unnatural artifacts. By building on top of a differentiable framework, the proposed pipeline lays the groundwork for a fast and differentiable ultrasound simulation tool necessary for gradient-based optimization, enabling advanced ultrasound beamforming strategies, neural network integration, and accurate inverse scene reconstruction.

- **Summary**: The task of text-to-image generation has encountered significant challenges when applied to literary works, especially poetry. Poems are a distinct form of literature, with meanings that frequently transcend beyond the literal words. To address this shortcoming, we propose a PoemToPixel framework designed to generate images that visually represent the inherent meanings of poems. Our approach incorporates the concept of prompt tuning in our image generation framework to ensure that the resulting images closely align with the poetic content. In addition, we propose the PoeKey algorithm, which extracts three key elements in the form of emotions, visual elements, and themes from poems to form instructions which are subsequently provided to a diffusion model for generating corresponding images. Furthermore, to expand the diversity of the poetry dataset across different genres and ages, we introduce MiniPo, a novel multimodal dataset comprising 1001 children's poems and images. Leveraging this dataset alongside PoemSum, we conducted both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of image generation using our PoemToPixel framework. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and offers a fresh perspective on generating images from literary sources.

- **Summary**: Clothing-change person re-identification (CC Re-ID) has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its application prospect. Most existing works struggle to adequately extract the ID-related information from the original RGB images. In this paper, we propose an Identity-aware Feature Decoupling (IFD) learning framework to mine identity-related features. Particularly, IFD exploits a dual stream architecture that consists of a main stream and an attention stream. The attention stream takes the clothing-masked images as inputs and derives the identity attention weights for effectively transferring the spatial knowledge to the main stream and highlighting the regions with abundant identity-related information. To eliminate the semantic gap between the inputs of two streams, we propose a clothing bias diminishing module specific to the main stream to regularize the features of clothing-relevant regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other baseline models on several widely-used CC Re-ID datasets.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses through distinct stages, from early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) to late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and eventually to AD. Accurate identification of these stages, especially distinguishing LMCI from EMCI, is crucial for developing pre-dementia treatments but remains challenging due to subtle and overlapping imaging features. This study proposes a minimal-feature machine learning framework that leverages structural MRI data, focusing on the hippocampus and amygdala as regions of interest. The framework addresses the curse of dimensionality through feature selection, utilizes region-specific voxel information, and implements innovative data organization to enhance classification performance by reducing noise. The methodology integrates dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE with state-of-the-art classifiers, achieving the highest accuracy of 88.46%. This framework demonstrates the potential for efficient and accurate staging of AD progression while providing valuable insights for clinical applications.

- **Summary**: Depicting novel classes with language descriptions by observing few-shot samples is inherent in human-learning systems. This lifelong learning capability helps to distinguish new knowledge from old ones through the increase of open-world learning, namely Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL). Existing works to solve this problem mainly rely on the careful tuning of visual encoders, which shows an evident trade-off between the base knowledge and incremental ones. Motivated by human learning systems, we propose a new Language-inspired Relation Transfer (LRT) paradigm to understand objects by joint visual clues and text depictions, composed of two major steps. We first transfer the pretrained text knowledge to the visual domains by proposing a graph relation transformation module and then fuse the visual and language embedding by a text-vision prototypical fusion module. Second, to mitigate the domain gap caused by visual finetuning, we propose context prompt learning for fast domain alignment and imagined contrastive learning to alleviate the insufficient text data during alignment. With collaborative learning of domain alignments and text-image transfer, our proposed LRT outperforms the state-of-the-art models by over $13\%$ and $7\%$ on the final session of mini-ImageNet and CIFAR-100 FSCIL benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful strategy to address the issue of generating factually incorrect outputs in foundation models by retrieving external knowledge relevant to queries and incorporating it into their generation process. However, existing RAG approaches have primarily focused on textual information, with some recent advancements beginning to consider images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of representing events, processes, and contextual details more effectively than any other modality. While a few recent studies explore the integration of videos in the response generation process, they either predefine query-associated videos without retrieving them according to queries, or convert videos into the textual descriptions without harnessing their multimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a novel framework that not only dynamically retrieves relevant videos based on their relevance with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information of videos in the output generation. Further, to operationalize this, our method revolves around the recent advance of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable the direct processing of video content to represent it for retrieval and seamless integration of the retrieved videos jointly with queries. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of VideoRAG, showcasing that it is superior to relevant baselines.

- **Summary**: Designing efficient neural networks for embedded devices is a critical challenge, particularly in applications requiring real-time performance, such as aerial imaging with drones and UAVs for emergency responses. In this work, we introduce TakuNet, a novel light-weight architecture which employs techniques such as depth-wise convolutions and an early downsampling stem to reduce computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. It leverages dense connections for fast convergence during training and uses 16-bit floating-point precision for optimization on embedded hardware accelerators. Experimental evaluation on two public datasets shows that TakuNet achieves near-state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying aerial images of emergency situations, despite its minimal parameter count. Real-world tests on embedded devices, namely Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi, confirm TakuNet's efficiency, achieving more than 650 fps on the 15W Jetson board, making it suitable for real-time AI processing on resource-constrained platforms and advancing the applicability of drones in emergency scenarios.

- **Summary**: The exponential growth of short-video content has ignited a surge in the necessity for efficient, automated solutions to video editing, with challenges arising from the need to understand videos and tailor the editing according to user requirements. Addressing this need, we propose an innovative end-to-end foundational framework, ultimately actualizing precise control over the final video content editing. Leveraging the flexibility and generalizability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we defined clear input-output mappings for efficient video creation. To bolster the model's capability in processing and comprehending video content, we introduce a strategic combination of a denser frame rate and a slow-fast processing technique, significantly enhancing the extraction and understanding of both temporal and spatial video information. Furthermore, we introduce a text-to-edit mechanism that allows users to achieve desired video outcomes through textual input, thereby enhancing the quality and controllability of the edited videos. Through comprehensive experimentation, our method has not only showcased significant effectiveness within advertising datasets, but also yields universally applicable conclusions on public datasets.

- **Summary**: Detecting small targets in drone imagery is challenging due to low resolution, complex backgrounds, and dynamic scenes. We propose EDNet, a novel edge-target detection framework built on an enhanced YOLOv10 architecture, optimized for real-time applications without post-processing. EDNet incorporates an XSmall detection head and a Cross Concat strategy to improve feature fusion and multi-scale context awareness for detecting tiny targets in diverse environments. Our unique C2f-FCA block employs Faster Context Attention to enhance feature extraction while reducing computational complexity. The WIoU loss function is employed for improved bounding box regression. With seven model sizes ranging from Tiny to XL, EDNet accommodates various deployment environments, enabling local real-time inference and ensuring data privacy. Notably, EDNet achieves up to a 5.6% gain in mAP@50 with significantly fewer parameters. On an iPhone 12, EDNet variants operate at speeds ranging from 16 to 55 FPS, providing a scalable and efficient solution for edge-based object detection in challenging drone imagery.

- **Summary**: In real-world images, slanted or curved texts, especially those on cans, banners, or badges, appear as frequently, if not more so, than flat texts due to artistic design or layout constraints. While high-quality visual text generation has become available with the advanced generative capabilities of diffusion models, these models often produce distorted text and inharmonious text background when given slanted or curved text layouts due to training data limitation. In this paper, we introduce a new training-free framework, STGen, which accurately generates visual texts in challenging scenarios (\eg, slanted or curved text layouts) while harmonizing them with the text background. Our framework decomposes the visual text generation process into two branches: (i) \textbf{Semantic Rectification Branch}, which leverages the ability in generating flat but accurate visual texts of the model to guide the generation of challenging scenarios. The generated latent of flat text is abundant in accurate semantic information related both to the text itself and its background. By incorporating this, we rectify the semantic information of the texts and harmonize the integration of the text with its background in complex layouts. (ii) \textbf{Structure Injection Branch}, which reinforces the visual text structure during inference. We incorporate the latent information of the glyph image, rich in glyph structure, as a new condition to further strengthen the text structure. To enhance image harmony, we also apply an effective combination method to merge the priors, providing a solid foundation for generation. Extensive experiments across a variety of visual text layouts demonstrate that our framework achieves superior accuracy and outstanding quality.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) introduce a novel event-driven self-attention paradigm that combines the high performance of Transformers with the energy efficiency of SNNs. However, the larger model size and increased computational demands of the Transformer structure limit their practicality in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we integrate binarization techniques into Transformer-based SNNs and propose the Binary Event-Driven Spiking Transformer, i.e. BESTformer. The proposed BESTformer can significantly reduce storage and computational demands by representing weights and attention maps with a mere 1-bit. However, BESTformer suffers from a severe performance drop from its full-precision counterpart due to the limited representation capability of binarization. To address this issue, we propose a Coupled Information Enhancement (CIE) method, which consists of a reversible framework and information enhancement distillation. By maximizing the mutual information between the binary model and its full-precision counterpart, the CIE method effectively mitigates the performance degradation of the BESTformer. Extensive experiments on static and neuromorphic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to other binary SNNs, showcasing its potential as a compact yet high-performance model for resource-limited edge devices.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised segmentation has the potential to greatly reduce the annotation effort for training segmentation models for small structures such as hyper-reflective foci (HRF) in optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, most weakly supervised methods either involve a strong downsampling of input images, or only achieve localization at a coarse resolution, both of which are unsatisfactory for small structures. We propose a novel framework that increases the spatial resolution of a traditional attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach by using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to prompt the Segment Anything Model (SAM~2), and increases recall with iterative inference. Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing MIL with a Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT), which adds a positional encoding, and permits an exchange of information between different regions of the OCT image, leads to a further and substantial increase in segmentation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Detecting and interpreting operator actions, engagement, and object interactions in dynamic industrial workflows remains a significant challenge in human-robot collaboration research, especially within complex, real-world environments. Traditional unimodal methods often fall short of capturing the intricacies of these unstructured industrial settings. To address this gap, we present a novel Multimodal Industrial Activity Monitoring (MIAM) dataset that captures realistic assembly and disassembly tasks, facilitating the evaluation of key meta-tasks such as action localization, object interaction, and engagement prediction. The dataset comprises multi-view RGB, depth, and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data collected from 22 sessions, amounting to 290 minutes of untrimmed video, annotated in detail for task performance and operator behavior. Its distinctiveness lies in the integration of multiple data modalities and its emphasis on real-world, untrimmed industrial workflows-key for advancing research in human-robot collaboration and operator monitoring. Additionally, we propose a multimodal network that fuses RGB frames, IMU data, and skeleton sequences to predict engagement levels during industrial tasks. Our approach improves the accuracy of recognizing engagement states, providing a robust solution for monitoring operator performance in dynamic industrial environments. The dataset and code can be accessed from https://github.com/navalkishoremehta95/MIAM/.

- **Summary**: Foundation models for computational pathology have shown great promise for specimen-level tasks and are increasingly accessible to researchers. However, specimen-level models built on these foundation models remain largely unavailable, hindering their broader utility and impact. To address this gap, we developed SpinPath, a toolkit designed to democratize specimen-level deep learning by providing a zoo of pretrained specimen-level models, a Python-based inference engine, and a JavaScript-based inference platform. We demonstrate the utility of SpinPath in metastasis detection tasks across nine foundation models. SpinPath may foster reproducibility, simplify experimentation, and accelerate the adoption of specimen-level deep learning in computational pathology research.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce SAIL-VL (ScAlable Vision Language Model TraIning via High QuaLity Data Curation), an open-source vision language model (VLM) of state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 2B parameters. We introduce three key improvements that contribute to SAIL-VL's leading performance: (1) Scalable high-quality visual understanding data construction: We implement a visual understanding data construction pipeline, which enables hundred-million-scale high-quality recaption data annotation. Equipped with this pipeline, we curate SAIL-Caption, a large-scale caption dataset with large quantity and the highest data quality compared with opensource caption datasets. (2) Scalable Pretraining with High-Quality Visual Understanding Data: We scale SAIL-VL's pretraining budget up to 131B tokens and show that even a 2B VLM benefits from scaled up training data sizes, exhibiting expected data size scaling laws in visual understanding and instruction following performance. (3) Scalable SFT via quantity and quality scaling: We introduce general guidance for instruction data curation to scale up instruction data continuously, allowing us to construct a large SFT dataset with the highest quality. To further improve SAIL-VL's performance, we propose quality scaling, a multi-stage training recipe with curriculum learning, to improve model performance scaling curves w.r.t. data sizes from logarithmic to be near-linear. SAIL-VL obtains the highest average score in 19 commonly used benchmarks in our evaluation and achieves top1 performance among VLMs of comparable sizes on OpenCompass (https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal). We release our SAIL-VL-2B model at HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/BytedanceDouyinContent/SAIL-VL-2B).

- **Summary**: The conversion from 2D X-ray to 3D shape holds significant potential for improving diagnostic efficiency and safety. However, existing reconstruction methods often rely on hand-crafted features, manual intervention, and prior knowledge, resulting in unstable shape errors and additional processing costs. In this paper, we introduce Swin-X2S, an end-to-end deep learning method for directly reconstructing 3D segmentation and labeling from 2D biplanar orthogonal X-ray images. Swin-X2S employs an encoder-decoder architecture: the encoder leverages 2D Swin Transformer for X-ray information extraction, while the decoder employs 3D convolution with cross-attention to integrate structural features from orthogonal views. A dimension-expanding module is introduced to bridge the encoder and decoder, ensuring a smooth conversion from 2D pixels to 3D voxels. We evaluate proposed method through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments across nine publicly available datasets covering four anatomies (femur, hip, spine, and rib), with a total of 54 categories. Significant improvements over previous methods have been observed not only in the segmentation and labeling metrics but also in the clinically relevant parameters that are of primary concern in practical applications, which demonstrates the promise of Swin-X2S to provide an effective option for anatomical shape reconstruction in clinical scenarios.

- **Summary**: The skin, as the largest organ of the human body, is vulnerable to a diverse array of conditions collectively known as skin lesions, which encompass various dermatoses. Diagnosing these lesions presents significant challenges for medical practitioners due to the subtle visual differences that are often imperceptible to the naked eye. While not all skin lesions are life-threatening, certain types can act as early indicators of severe diseases, including skin cancers, underscoring the critical need for timely and accurate diagnostic methods. Deep learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable potential in facilitating the early detection and prognosis of skin lesions. This study advances the field by curating a comprehensive and diverse dataset comprising 39 categories of skin lesions, synthesized from five publicly available datasets. Using this dataset, the performance of five state-of-the-art deep learning models -- MobileNetV2, Xception, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB1, and Vision Transformer - is rigorously evaluated. To enhance the accuracy and robustness of these models, attention mechanisms such as the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) are incorporated into their architectures. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple performance metrics reveals that the Vision Transformer model integrated with CBAM outperforms others, achieving an accuracy of 93.46%, precision of 94%, recall of 93%, F1-score of 93%, and specificity of 93.67%. These results underscore the significant potential of the proposed system in supporting medical professionals with accurate and efficient prognostic tools for diagnosing a broad spectrum of skin lesions.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving technology is rapidly evolving, offering the potential for safer and more efficient transportation. However, the performance of these systems can be significantly compromised by the occlusion on sensors due to environmental factors like dirt, dust, rain, and fog. These occlusions severely affect vision-based tasks such as object detection, vehicle segmentation, and lane recognition. In this paper, we investigate the impact of various kinds of occlusions on camera sensor by projecting their effects from multi-view camera images of the nuScenes dataset into the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) domain. This approach allows us to analyze how occlusions spatially distribute and influence vehicle segmentation accuracy within the BEV domain. Despite significant advances in sensor technology and multi-sensor fusion, a gap remains in the existing literature regarding the specific effects of camera occlusions on BEV-based perception systems. To address this gap, we use a multi-sensor fusion technique that integrates LiDAR and radar sensor data to mitigate the performance degradation caused by occluded cameras. Our findings demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of vehicle segmentation tasks, leading to more reliable autonomous driving systems.

- **Summary**: Matching objects across partially overlapping camera views is crucial in multi-camera systems and requires a view-invariant feature extraction network. Training such a network with cycle-consistency circumvents the need for labor-intensive labeling. In this paper, we extend the mathematical formulation of cycle-consistency to handle partial overlap. We then introduce a pseudo-mask which directs the training loss to take partial overlap into account. We additionally present several new cycle variants that complement each other and present a time-divergent scene sampling scheme that improves the data input for this self-supervised setting. Cross-camera matching experiments on the challenging DIVOTrack dataset show the merits of our approach. Compared to the self-supervised state-of-the-art, we achieve a 4.3 percentage point higher F1 score with our combined contributions. Our improvements are robust to reduced overlap in the training data, with substantial improvements in challenging scenes that need to make few matches between many people. Self-supervised feature networks trained with our method are effective at matching objects in a range of multi-camera settings, providing opportunities for complex tasks like large-scale multi-camera scene understanding.

- **Summary**: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can leverage abundant unlabeled data to boost model performance. However, the class-imbalanced data distribution in real-world scenarios poses great challenges to SSL, resulting in performance degradation. Existing class-imbalanced semi-supervised learning (CISSL) methods mainly focus on rebalancing datasets but ignore the potential of using hard examples to enhance performance, making it difficult to fully harness the power of unlabeled data even with sophisticated algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a method that enhances the performance of Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Learning by Mining Hard Examples (SeMi). This method distinguishes the entropy differences among logits of hard and easy examples, thereby identifying hard examples and increasing the utility of unlabeled data, better addressing the imbalance problem in CISSL. In addition, we maintain a class-balanced memory bank with confidence decay for storing high-confidence embeddings to enhance the pseudo-labels' reliability. Although our method is simple, it is effective and seamlessly integrates with existing approaches. We perform comprehensive experiments on standard CISSL benchmarks and experimentally demonstrate that our proposed SeMi outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks, especially in reversed scenarios, where our best result shows approximately a 54.8\% improvement over the baseline methods.

- **Summary**: We propose a method for generating fly-through videos of a scene, from a single image and a given camera trajectory. We build upon an image-to-video latent diffusion model. We condition its UNet denoiser on the camera trajectory, using four techniques. (1) We condition the UNet's temporal blocks on raw camera extrinsics, similar to MotionCtrl. (2) We use images containing camera rays and directions, similar to CameraCtrl. (3) We reproject the initial image to subsequent frames and use the resulting video as a condition. (4) We use 2D<=>3D transformers to introduce a global 3D representation, which implicitly conditions on the camera poses. We combine all conditions in a ContolNet-style architecture. We then propose a metric that evaluates overall video quality and the ability to preserve details with view changes, which we use to analyze the trade-offs of individual and combined conditions. Finally, we identify an optimal combination of conditions. We calibrate camera positions in our datasets for scale consistency across scenes, and we train our scene exploration model, CamCtrl3D, demonstrating state-of-theart results.

- **Summary**: 3D digital anthropometry is the study of estimating human body measurements from 3D scans. Precise body measurements are important health indicators in the medical industry, and guiding factors in the fashion, ergonomic and entertainment industries. The measuring protocol consists of scanning the whole subject in the static A-pose, which is maintained without breathing or movement during the scanning process. However, the A-pose is not easy to maintain during the whole scanning process, which can last even up to a couple of minutes. This constraint affects the final quality of the scan, which in turn affects the accuracy of the estimated body measurements obtained from methods that rely on dense geometric data. Additionally, this constraint makes it impossible to develop a digital anthropometry method for subjects unable to assume the A-pose, such as those with injuries or disabilities. We propose a method that can obtain body measurements from sparse landmarks acquired in any pose. We make use of the sparse landmarks of the posed subject to create pose-independent features, and train a network to predict the body measurements as taken from the standard A-pose. We show that our method achieves comparable results to competing methods that use dense geometry in the standard A-pose, but has the capability of estimating the body measurements from any pose using sparse landmarks only. Finally, we address the lack of open-source 3D anthropometry methods by making our method available to the research community at https://github.com/DavidBoja/pose-independent-anthropometry.

- **Summary**: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 12 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.

- **Summary**: A robust segmentation method that can be used to perform measurements on toenails is presented. The proposed method is used as the first step in a clinical trial to objectively quantify the incidence of a particular pathology. For such an assessment, it is necessary to distinguish a nail, which locally appears to be similar to the skin. Many algorithms have been used, each of which leverages different aspects of toenail appearance. We used the Hough transform to locate the tip of the toe and estimate the nail location and size. Subsequently, we classified the super-pixels of the image based on their geometric and photometric information. Thereafter, the watershed transform delineated the border of the nail. The method was validated using a 348-image medical dataset, achieving an accuracy of 0.993 and an F-measure of 0.925. The proposed method is considerably robust across samples, with respect to factors such as nail shape, skin pigmentation, illumination conditions, and appearance of large regions affected by a medical condition

- **Summary**: Transductive zero-shot learning with vision-language models leverages image-image similarities within the dataset to achieve better classification accuracy compared to the inductive setting. However, there is little work that explores the structure of the language space in this context. We propose GTA-CLIP, a novel technique that incorporates supervision from language models for joint transduction in language and vision spaces. Our approach is iterative and consists of three steps: (i) incrementally exploring the attribute space by querying language models, (ii) an attribute-augmented transductive inference procedure, and (iii) fine-tuning the language and vision encoders based on inferred labels within the dataset. Through experiments with CLIP encoders, we demonstrate that GTA-CLIP, yields an average performance improvement of 8.6% and 3.7% across 12 datasets and 3 encoders, over CLIP and transductive CLIP respectively in the zero-shot setting. We also observe similar improvements in a few-shot setting. We present ablation studies that demonstrate the value of each step and visualize how the vision and language spaces evolve over iterations driven by the transductive learning.

- **Summary**: Probabilistic human motion prediction aims to forecast multiple possible future movements from past observations. While current approaches report high diversity and realism, they often generate motions with undetected limb stretching and jitter. To address this, we introduce SkeletonDiffusion, a latent diffusion model that embeds an explicit inductive bias on the human body within its architecture and training. Our model is trained with a novel nonisotropic Gaussian diffusion formulation that aligns with the natural kinematic structure of the human skeleton. Results show that our approach outperforms conventional isotropic alternatives, consistently generating realistic predictions while avoiding artifacts such as limb distortion. Additionally, we identify a limitation in commonly used diversity metrics, which may inadvertently favor models that produce inconsistent limb lengths within the same sequence. SkeletonDiffusion sets a new benchmark on three real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: During tumor resection surgery, surgeons rely on neuronavigation to locate tumors and other critical structures in the brain. Most neuronavigation is based on preoperative images, such as MRI and ultrasound, to navigate through the brain. Neuronavigation acts like GPS for the brain, guiding neurosurgeons during the procedure. However, brain shift, a dynamic deformation caused by factors such as osmotic concentration, fluid levels, and tissue resection, can invalidate the preoperative images and introduce registration uncertainty. Considering and effectively visualizing this uncertainty has the potential to help surgeons trust the navigation again. Uncertainty has been studied in various domains since the 19th century. Considering uncertainty requires two essential components: 1) quantifying uncertainty; and 2) conveying the quantified values to the observer. There has been growing interest in both of these research areas during the past few decades.

- **Summary**: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) has gained popularity for its promise to train models with weak labels to segment objects that visually blend into their surroundings. Recently, some methods using sparsely-annotated supervision shown promising results through scribbling in WSCOD, while point-text supervision remains underexplored. Hence, this paper introduces a novel holistically point-guided text framework for WSCOD by decomposing into three phases: segment, choose, train. Specifically, we propose Point-guided Candidate Generation (PCG), where the point's foreground serves as a correction for the text path to explicitly correct and rejuvenate the loss detection object during the mask generation process (SEGMENT). We also introduce a Qualified Candidate Discriminator (QCD) to choose the optimal mask from a given text prompt using CLIP (CHOOSE), and employ the chosen pseudo mask for training with a self-supervised Vision Transformer (TRAIN). Additionally, we developed a new point-supervised dataset (P2C-COD) and a text-supervised dataset (T-COD). Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, and also outperforms some existing fully-supervised camouflaged object detection methods.

- **Summary**: Spatial proteomics technologies have transformed our understanding of complex tissue architectures by enabling simultaneous analysis of multiple molecular markers and their spatial organization. The high dimensionality of these data, varying marker combinations across experiments and heterogeneous study designs pose unique challenges for computational analysis. Here, we present Virtual Tissues (VirTues), a foundation model framework for biological tissues that operates across the molecular, cellular and tissue scale. VirTues introduces innovations in transformer architecture design, including a novel tokenization scheme that captures both spatial and marker dimensions, and attention mechanisms that scale to high-dimensional multiplex data while maintaining interpretability. Trained on diverse cancer and non-cancer tissue datasets, VirTues demonstrates strong generalization capabilities without task-specific fine-tuning, enabling cross-study analysis and novel marker integration. As a generalist model, VirTues outperforms existing approaches across clinical diagnostics, biological discovery and patient case retrieval tasks, while providing insights into tissue function and disease mechanisms.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT) has demonstrated significant potential in various vision tasks due to its strong ability in modelling long-range dependencies. However, such success is largely fueled by training on massive samples. In real applications, the large-scale datasets are not always available, and ViT performs worse than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) if it is only trained on small scale dataset (called tiny dataset), since it requires large amount of training data to ensure its representational capacity. In this paper, a small-size ViT architecture with multi-scale self-attention mechanism and convolution blocks is presented (dubbed MSCViT) to model different scales of attention at each layer. Firstly, we introduced wavelet convolution, which selectively combines the high-frequency components obtained by frequency division with our convolution channel to extract local features. Then, a lightweight multi-head attention module is developed to reduce the number of tokens and computational costs. Finally, the positional encoding (PE) in the backbone is replaced by a local feature extraction module. Compared with the original ViT, it is parameter-efficient and is particularly suitable for tiny datasets. Extensive experiments have been conducted on tiny datasets, in which our model achieves an accuracy of 84.68% on CIFAR-100 with 14.0M parameters and 2.5 GFLOPs, without pre-training on large datasets.

- **Summary**: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, celebrated for its high resolution, all-weather capability, and day-night operability, is indispensable for maritime applications. However, ship detection in SAR imagery faces significant challenges, including complex backgrounds, densely arranged targets, and large scale variations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Center-Aware SAR Ship Detector (CASS-Det), designed for robust multi-scale and densely packed ship detection. CASS-Det integrates three key innovations: (1) a center enhancement module (CEM) that employs rotational convolution to emphasize ship centers, improving localization while suppressing background interference; (2) a neighbor attention module (NAM) that leverages cross-layer dependencies to refine ship boundaries in densely populated scenes; and (3) a cross-connected feature pyramid network (CC-FPN) that enhances multi-scale feature fusion by integrating shallow and deep features. Extensive experiments on the SSDD, HRSID, and LS-SSDD-v1.0 datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CASS-Det, excelling at detecting multi-scale and densely arranged ships.

- **Summary**: Action detection in real-world scenarios is particularly challenging due to densely distributed actions in hour-long untrimmed videos. It requires modeling both short- and long-term temporal relationships while handling significant intra-class temporal variations. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer-based architectures, though effective, are impractical for real-world deployment due to their high parameter count, GPU memory usage, and limited throughput, making them unsuitable for very long videos. In this work, we innovatively adapt the Mamba architecture for action detection and propose Multi-scale Temporal Mamba (MS-Temba), comprising two key components: Temporal Mamba (Temba) Blocks and the Temporal Mamba Fuser. Temba Blocks include the Temporal Local Module (TLM) for short-range temporal modeling and the Dilated Temporal SSM (DTS) for long-range dependencies. By introducing dilations, a novel concept for Mamba, TLM and DTS capture local and global features at multiple scales. The Temba Fuser aggregates these scale-specific features using Mamba to learn comprehensive multi-scale representations of untrimmed videos. MS-Temba is validated on three public datasets, outperforming SOTA methods on long videos and matching prior methods on short videos while using only one-eighth of the parameters.

- **Summary**: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis plays a crucial role in modern digital pathology, enabling large-scale feature extraction from tissue samples. However, traditional feature extraction pipelines based on tools like CellProfiler often involve lengthy workflows, requiring WSI segmentation into patches, feature extraction at the patch level, and subsequent mapping back to the original WSI. To address these challenges, we present PySpatial, a high-speed pathomics toolkit specifically designed for WSI-level analysis. PySpatial streamlines the conventional pipeline by directly operating on computational regions of interest, reducing redundant processing steps. Utilizing rtree-based spatial indexing and matrix-based computation, PySpatial efficiently maps and processes computational regions, significantly accelerating feature extraction while maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments on two datasets-Perivascular Epithelioid Cell (PEC) and data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP)-demonstrate substantial performance improvements. For smaller and sparse objects in PEC datasets, PySpatial achieves nearly a 10-fold speedup compared to standard CellProfiler pipelines. For larger objects, such as glomeruli and arteries in KPMP datasets, PySpatial achieves a 2-fold speedup. These results highlight PySpatial's potential to handle large-scale WSI analysis with enhanced efficiency and accuracy, paving the way for broader applications in digital pathology.

- **Summary**: Recent video generation models have shown promising results in producing high-quality video clips lasting several seconds. However, these models face challenges in generating long sequences that convey clear and informative events, limiting their ability to support coherent narrations. In this paper, we present a large-scale cooking video dataset designed to advance long-form narrative generation in the cooking domain. We validate the quality of our proposed dataset in terms of visual fidelity and textual caption accuracy using state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and video generation models, respectively. We further introduce a Long Narrative Video Director to enhance both visual and semantic coherence in generated videos and emphasize the role of aligning visual embeddings to achieve improved overall video quality. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements in generating visually detailed and semantically aligned keyframes, supported by finetuning techniques that integrate text and image embeddings within the video generation process.

- **Summary**: Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface. These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection, resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map, managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules: Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI), and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall score of 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, significantly outperforming 0.369 of GPT-4o. Our work, emPowering gEologic mAp holistiC undErstanding (PEACE) with MLLMs, paves the way for advanced AI applications in geology, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of geological investigations.

- **Summary**: Reasoning is a fundamental capability for solving complex multi-step problems, particularly in visual contexts where sequential step-wise understanding is essential. Existing approaches lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating visual reasoning and do not emphasize step-wise problem-solving. To this end, we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step visual reasoning in large language models (LMMs) through three key contributions. First, we introduce a visual reasoning benchmark specifically designed to evaluate multi-step reasoning tasks. The benchmark presents a diverse set of challenges with eight different categories ranging from complex visual perception to scientific reasoning with over 4k reasoning steps in total, enabling robust evaluation of LLMs' abilities to perform accurate and interpretable visual reasoning across multiple steps. Second, we propose a novel metric that assesses visual reasoning quality at the granularity of individual steps, emphasizing both correctness and logical coherence. The proposed metric offers deeper insights into reasoning performance compared to traditional end-task accuracy metrics. Third, we present a new multimodal visual reasoning model, named LlamaV-o1, trained using a multi-step curriculum learning approach, where tasks are progressively organized to facilitate incremental skill acquisition and problem-solving. The proposed LlamaV-o1 is designed for multi-step reasoning and learns step-by-step through a structured training paradigm. Extensive experiments show that our LlamaV-o1 outperforms existing open-source models and performs favorably against close-source proprietary models. Compared to the recent Llava-CoT, our LlamaV-o1 achieves an average score of 67.3 with an absolute gain of 3.8\% across six benchmarks while being 5 times faster during inference scaling. Our benchmark, model, and code are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Video personalization methods allow us to synthesize videos with specific concepts such as people, pets, and places. However, existing methods often focus on limited domains, require time-consuming optimization per subject, or support only a single subject. We present Video Alchemist $-$ a video model with built-in multi-subject, open-set personalization capabilities for both foreground objects and background, eliminating the need for time-consuming test-time optimization. Our model is built on a new Diffusion Transformer module that fuses each conditional reference image and its corresponding subject-level text prompt with cross-attention layers. Developing such a large model presents two main challenges: dataset and evaluation. First, as paired datasets of reference images and videos are extremely hard to collect, we sample selected video frames as reference images and synthesize a clip of the target video. However, while models can easily denoise training videos given reference frames, they fail to generalize to new contexts. To mitigate this issue, we design a new automatic data construction pipeline with extensive image augmentations. Second, evaluating open-set video personalization is a challenge in itself. To address this, we introduce a personalization benchmark that focuses on accurate subject fidelity and supports diverse personalization scenarios. Finally, our extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing personalization methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: Foundation models are becoming increasingly popular due to their strong generalization capabilities resulting from being trained on huge datasets. These generalization capabilities are attractive in areas such as NIR Iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD), in which databases are limited in the number of subjects and diversity of attack instruments, and there is no correspondence between the bona fide and attack images because, most of the time, they do not belong to the same subjects. This work explores an iris PAD approach based on two foundation models, DinoV2 and VisualOpenClip. The results show that fine-tuning prediction with a small neural network as head overpasses the state-of-the-art performance based on deep learning approaches. However, systems trained from scratch have still reached better results if bona fide and attack images are available.

- **Summary**: We introduce MEt3R, a metric for multi-view consistency in generated images. Large-scale generative models for multi-view image generation are rapidly advancing the field of 3D inference from sparse observations. However, due to the nature of generative modeling, traditional reconstruction metrics are not suitable to measure the quality of generated outputs and metrics that are independent of the sampling procedure are desperately needed. In this work, we specifically address the aspect of consistency between generated multi-view images, which can be evaluated independently of the specific scene. Our approach uses DUSt3R to obtain dense 3D reconstructions from image pairs in a feed-forward manner, which are used to warp image contents from one view into the other. Then, feature maps of these images are compared to obtain a similarity score that is invariant to view-dependent effects. Using MEt3R, we evaluate the consistency of a large set of previous methods for novel view and video generation, including our open, multi-view latent diffusion model.

- **Summary**: Developing reliable healthcare AI models requires training with representative and diverse data. In imbalanced datasets, model performance tends to plateau on the more prevalent classes while remaining low on less common cases. To overcome this limitation, we propose DiffUltra, the first generative AI technique capable of synthesizing realistic Lung Ultrasound (LUS) images with extensive lesion variability. Specifically, we condition the generative AI by the introduced Lesion-anatomy Bank, which captures the lesion's structural and positional properties from real patient data to guide the image synthesis.We demonstrate that DiffUltra improves consolidation detection by 5.6% in AP compared to the models trained solely on real patient data. More importantly, DiffUltra increases data diversity and prevalence of rare cases, leading to a 25% AP improvement in detecting rare instances such as large lung consolidations, which make up only 10% of the dataset.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose Mix-QViT, an explainability-driven MPQ framework that systematically allocates bit-widths to each layer based on two criteria: layer importance, assessed via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which identifies how much each layer contributes to the final classification, and quantization sensitivity, determined by evaluating the performance impact of quantizing each layer at various precision levels while keeping others layers at a baseline. Additionally, for post-training quantization (PTQ), we introduce a clipped channel-wise quantization method designed to reduce the effects of extreme outliers in post-LayerNorm activations by removing severe inter-channel variations. We validate our approach by applying Mix-QViT to ViT, DeiT, and Swin Transformer models across multiple datasets. Our experimental results for PTQ demonstrate that both fixed-bit and mixed-bit methods outperform existing techniques, particularly at 3-bit, 4-bit, and 6-bit precision. Furthermore, in quantization-aware training, Mix-QViT achieves superior performance with 2-bit mixed-precision.

- **Summary**: Kernel-based subspace clustering, which addresses the nonlinear structures in data, is an evolving area of research. Despite noteworthy progressions, prevailing methodologies predominantly grapple with limitations relating to (i) the influence of predefined kernels on model performance; (ii) the difficulty of preserving the original manifold structures in the nonlinear space; (iii) the dependency of spectral-type strategies on the ideal block diagonal structure of the affinity matrix. This paper presents DKLM, a novel paradigm for kernel-induced nonlinear subspace clustering. DKLM provides a data-driven approach that directly learns the kernel from the data's self-representation, ensuring adaptive weighting and satisfying the multiplicative triangle inequality constraint, which enhances the robustness of the learned kernel. By leveraging this learned kernel, DKLM preserves the local manifold structure of data in a nonlinear space while promoting the formation of an optimal block-diagonal affinity matrix. A thorough theoretical examination of DKLM reveals its relationship with existing clustering paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
