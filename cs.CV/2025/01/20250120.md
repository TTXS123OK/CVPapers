- **Summary**: Phenotype segmentation is pivotal in analysing visual features of living organisms, enhancing our understanding of their characteristics. In the context of oysters, meat quality assessment is paramount, focusing on shell, meat, gonad, and muscle components. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and subjective, prompting the adoption of machine vision technology for efficient and objective evaluation. We explore machine vision's capacity for segmenting oyster components, leading to the development of a multi-network ensemble approach with a global-local hierarchical attention mechanism. This approach integrates predictions from diverse models and addresses challenges posed by varying scales, ensuring robust instance segmentation across components. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance using different real-world datasets, highlighting its efficacy and robustness in enhancing oyster phenotype segmentation.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models achieve superior performance in image generation tasks. However, it incurs significant computation overheads due to its iterative structure. To address these overheads, we analyze this iterative structure and observe that adjacent time steps in diffusion models exhibit high value similarity, leading to narrower differences between consecutive time steps. We adapt these characteristics to a quantized diffusion model and reveal that the majority of these differences can be represented with reduced bit-width, and even zero. Based on our observations, we propose the Ditto algorithm, a difference processing algorithm that leverages temporal similarity with quantization to enhance the efficiency of diffusion models. By exploiting the narrower differences and the distributive property of layer operations, it performs full bit-width operations for the initial time step and processes subsequent steps with temporal differences. In addition, Ditto execution flow optimization is designed to mitigate the memory overhead of temporal difference processing, further boosting the efficiency of the Ditto algorithm. We also design the Ditto hardware, a specialized hardware accelerator, fully exploiting the dynamic characteristics of the proposed algorithm. As a result, the Ditto hardware achieves up to 1.5x speedup and 17.74% energy saving compared to other accelerators.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained prominence in refining model fitting tasks in computer vision, particularly in domains involving deformable models like Active Appearance Models (AAMs). This paper explores the integration of GANs to enhance the AAM fitting process, addressing challenges in optimizing nonlinear parameters associated with appearance and shape variations. By leveraging GANs' adversarial training framework, the aim is to minimize fitting errors and improve convergence rates. Achieving robust performance even in cases with high appearance variability and occlusions. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional optimization techniques, thus establishing GANs as a potent tool for advanced image model fitting.

- **Summary**: Establishing the reproducibility of radiomic signatures is a critical step in the path to clinical adoption of quantitative imaging biomarkers; however, radiomic signatures must also be meaningfully related to an outcome of clinical importance to be of value for personalized medicine. In this study, we analyze both the reproducibility and prognostic value of radiomic features extracted from the liver parenchyma and largest liver metastases in contrast enhanced CT scans of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). A prospective cohort of 81 patients from two major US cancer centers was used to establish the reproducibility of radiomic features extracted from images reconstructed with different slice thicknesses. A publicly available, single-center cohort of 197 preoperative scans from patients who underwent hepatic resection for treatment of CRLM was used to evaluate the prognostic value of features and models to predict overall survival. A standard set of 93 features was extracted from all images, with a set of eight different extractor settings. The feature extraction settings producing the most reproducible, as well as the most prognostically discriminative feature values were highly dependent on both the region of interest and the specific feature in question. While the best overall predictive model was produced using features extracted with a particular setting, without accounting for reproducibility, (C-index = 0.630 (0.603--0.649)) an equivalent-performing model (C-index = 0.629 (0.605--0.645)) was produced by pooling features from all extraction settings, and thresholding features with low reproducibility ($\mathrm{CCC} \geq 0.85$), prior to feature selection. Our findings support a data-driven approach to feature extraction and selection, preferring the inclusion of many features, and narrowing feature selection based on reproducibility when relevant data is available.

- **Summary**: Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images are often corrupted by noise, hindering their interpretation. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based approach using simulated images. Using density functional theory calculations with a set of pseudo-atomic orbital basis sets, we generate highly accurate ground truth images. We introduce four types of noise into these simulations to create realistic training datasets. Each type of noise is then used to train a separate convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Our results show that these CNNs are effective in reducing noise, even when applied to images with different noise levels than those used during training. However, we observe limitations in some cases, particularly in preserving the integrity of circular shapes and avoiding visible artifacts between image patches. To overcome these challenges, we propose alternative training strategies and future research directions. This study provides a valuable framework for training deep learning models for TEM image denoising.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel joint channel-estimation and source-detection algorithm using successive interference cancellation (SIC)-aided generative score-based diffusion models. Prior work in this area focuses on massive MIMO scenarios, which are typically characterized by full-rank channels, and fail in low-rank channel scenarios. The proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in joint source-channel estimation, especially in low-rank scenarios where the number of users exceeds the number of antennas at the access point (AP). The proposed score-based iterative diffusion process estimates the gradient of the prior distribution on partial channels, and recursively updates the estimated channel parts as well as the source. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and symbol error rate (SER) in both full-rank and low-rank channel scenarios, while having a more dominant effect in the latter, at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).

- **Summary**: Visual Language Models such as CLIP excel in image recognition due to extensive image-text pre-training. However, applying the CLIP inference in zero-shot classification, particularly for medical image diagnosis, faces challenges due to: 1) the inadequacy of representing image classes solely with single category names; 2) the modal gap between the visual and text spaces generated by CLIP encoders. Despite attempts to enrich disease descriptions with large language models, the lack of class-specific knowledge often leads to poor performance. In addition, empirical evidence suggests that existing proxy learning methods for zero-shot image classification on natural image datasets exhibit instability when applied to medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Knowledge Proxy Learning (KPL) to mine knowledge from CLIP. KPL is designed to leverage CLIP's multimodal understandings for medical image classification through Text Proxy Optimization and Multimodal Proxy Learning. Specifically, KPL retrieves image-relevant knowledge descriptions from the constructed knowledge-enhanced base to enrich semantic text proxies. It then harnesses input images and these descriptions, encoded via CLIP, to stably generate multimodal proxies that boost the zero-shot classification performance. Extensive experiments conducted on both medical and natural image datasets demonstrate that KPL enables effective zero-shot image classification, outperforming all baselines. These findings highlight the great potential in this paradigm of mining knowledge from CLIP for medical image classification and broader areas.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a promising alternative method for training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on large-scale datasets with clear theoretical guarantees. GANs are typically learned through a minimax game between a generator and a discriminator, which is known to be empirically unstable. Previous learning paradigms have encountered mode collapse issues without a theoretical solution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Lipschitz-constrained Functional Gradient GANs learning (Li-CFG) method to stabilize the training of GAN and provide a theoretical foundation for effectively increasing the diversity of synthetic samples by reducing the neighborhood size of the latent vector. Specifically, we demonstrate that the neighborhood size of the latent vector can be reduced by increasing the norm of the discriminator gradient, resulting in enhanced diversity of synthetic samples. To efficiently enlarge the norm of the discriminator gradient, we introduce a novel {\epsilon}-centered gradient penalty that amplifies the norm of the discriminator gradient using the hyper-parameter {\epsilon}. In comparison to other constraints, our method enlarging the discriminator norm, thus obtaining the smallest neighborhood size of the latent vector. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets for image generation demonstrate the efficacy of the Li-CFG method and the {\epsilon}-centered gradient penalty. The results showcase improved stability and increased diversity of synthetic samples.

- **Summary**: Emojis have become a universal language in online communication, often carrying nuanced and context-dependent meanings. Among these, irony poses a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its inherent incongruity between appearance and intent. This study examines the ability of GPT-4o to interpret irony in emojis. By prompting GPT-4o to evaluate the likelihood of specific emojis being used to express irony on social media and comparing its interpretations with human perceptions, we aim to bridge the gap between machine and human understanding. Our findings reveal nuanced insights into GPT-4o's interpretive capabilities, highlighting areas of alignment with and divergence from human behavior. Additionally, this research underscores the importance of demographic factors, such as age and gender, in shaping emoji interpretation and evaluates how these factors influence GPT-4o's performance.

- **Summary**: Supervised fine-tuning methods (SFT) perform great efficiency on artificial intelligence interpretation in SAR images, leveraging the powerful representation knowledge from pre-training models. Due to the lack of domain-specific pre-trained backbones in SAR images, the traditional strategies are loading the foundation pre-train models of natural scenes such as ImageNet, whose characteristics of images are extremely different from SAR images. This may hinder the model performance on downstream tasks when adopting SFT on small-scale annotated SAR data. In this paper, an self-supervised learning (SSL) method of masked image modeling based on Masked Auto-Encoders (MAE) is proposed to learn feature representations of SAR images during the pre-training process and benefit the object detection task in SAR images of SFT. The evaluation experiments on the large-scale SAR object detection benchmark named SARDet-100k verify that the proposed method captures proper latent representations of SAR images and improves the model generalization in downstream tasks by converting the pre-trained domain from natural scenes to SAR images through SSL. The proposed method achieves an improvement of 1.3 mAP on the SARDet-100k benchmark compared to only the SFT strategies.



### How Well Do Supervised 3D Models Transfer to Medical Imaging Tasks?

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has become prominent in transfer learning. For example, if the model is pre-trained on ImageNet and then fine-tuned to PASCAL, it can significantly outperform that trained on PASCAL from scratch. While ImageNet pre-training has shown enormous success, it is formed in 2D, and the learned features are for classification tasks; when transferring to more diverse tasks, like 3D image segmentation, its performance is inevitably compromised due to the deviation from the original ImageNet context. A significant challenge lies in the lack of large, annotated 3D datasets rivaling the scale of ImageNet for model pre-training. To overcome this challenge, we make two contributions. Firstly, we construct AbdomenAtlas 1.1 that comprises 9,262 three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) volumes with high-quality, per-voxel annotations of 25 anatomical structures and pseudo annotations of seven tumor types. Secondly, we develop a suite of models that are pre-trained on our AbdomenAtlas 1.1 for transfer learning. Our preliminary analyses indicate that the model trained only with 21 CT volumes, 672 masks, and 40 GPU hours has a transfer learning ability similar to the model trained with 5,050 (unlabeled) CT volumes and 1,152 GPU hours. More importantly, the transfer learning ability of supervised models can further scale up with larger annotated datasets, achieving significantly better performance than preexisting pre-trained models, irrespective of their pre-training methodologies or data sources. We hope this study can facilitate collective efforts in constructing larger 3D medical datasets and more releases of supervised pre-trained models.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Monte-Carlo (MC) Dropout provides a practical solution for estimating predictive distributions in deterministic neural networks. Traditional dropout, applied within the signal space, may fail to account for frequency-related noise common in medical imaging, leading to biased predictive estimates. A novel approach extends Dropout to the frequency domain, allowing stochastic attenuation of signal frequencies during inference. This creates diverse global textural variations in feature maps while preserving structural integrity -- a factor we hypothesize and empirically show is contributing to accurately estimating uncertainties in semantic segmentation. We evaluated traditional MC-Dropout and the MC-frequency Dropout in three segmentation tasks involving different imaging modalities: (i) prostate zones in biparametric MRI, (ii) liver tumors in contrast-enhanced CT, and (iii) lungs in chest X-ray scans. Our results show that MC-Frequency Dropout improves calibration, convergence, and semantic uncertainty, thereby improving prediction scrutiny, boundary delineation, and has the potential to enhance medical decision-making.

- **Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in autonomous driving have revolutionized the way vehicles perceive and interact with their surroundings. In particular, world models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. Such models unify perception, prediction, and planning, thereby enabling autonomous systems to make rapid, informed decisions under complex and often unpredictable conditions. Research trends span diverse areas, including 4D occupancy prediction and generative data synthesis, all of which bolster scene understanding and trajectory forecasting. Notably, recent works exploit large-scale pretraining and advanced self-supervised learning to scale up models' capacity for rare-event simulation and real-time interaction. In addressing key challenges -- ranging from domain adaptation and long-tail anomaly detection to multimodal fusion -- these world models pave the way for more robust, reliable, and adaptable autonomous driving solutions. This survey systematically reviews the state of the art, categorizing techniques by their focus on future prediction, behavior planning, and the interaction between the two. We also identify potential directions for future research, emphasizing holistic integration, improved computational efficiency, and advanced simulation. Our comprehensive analysis underscores the transformative role of world models in driving next-generation autonomous systems toward safer and more equitable mobility.

- **Summary**: Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite communication demonstrates significant advantages in emergency short burst data services. However, unstable satellite networks, particularly those with frequent packet loss, present a severe challenge to accurate image transmission. To address it, we propose a loss-resilient image coding approach that leverages end-to-end optimization in learned image compression (LIC). Our method builds on the channel-wise progressive coding framework, incorporating Spatial-Channel Rearrangement (SCR) on the encoder side and Mask Conditional Aggregation (MCA) on the decoder side to improve reconstruction quality with unpredictable errors. By integrating the Gilbert-Elliot model into the training process, we enhance the model's ability to generalize in real-world network conditions. Extensive evaluations show that our approach outperforms traditional and deep learning-based methods in terms of compression performance and stability under diverse packet loss, offering robust and efficient progressive transmission even in challenging environments.

- **Summary**: Monitoring air pollution is crucial for protecting human health from exposure to harmful substances. Traditional methods of air quality monitoring, such as ground-based sensors and satellite-based remote sensing, face limitations due to high deployment costs, sparse sensor coverage, and environmental interferences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for high-resolution spatiotemporal Air Quality Index (AQI) mapping using sparse sensor data, satellite imagery, and various spatiotemporal factors. By leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we estimate AQI values at unmonitored locations based on both spatial and temporal dependencies. The framework incorporates a wide range of environmental features, including meteorological data, road networks, points of interest (PoIs), population density, and urban green spaces, which enhance prediction accuracy. We illustrate the use of our approach through a case study in Lahore, Pakistan, where multi-resolution data is used to generate the air quality index map at a fine spatiotemporal scale.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease among the elderly. Early prediction and timely intervention of its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), can decrease the risk of advancing to AD. Combining information from various modalities can significantly improve predictive accuracy. However, challenges such as missing data and heterogeneity across modalities complicate multimodal learning methods as adding more modalities can worsen these issues. Current multimodal fusion techniques often fail to adapt to the complexity of medical data, hindering the ability to identify relationships between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative multimodal approach for predicting MCI conversion, focusing specifically on the issues of missing positron emission tomography (PET) data and integrating diverse medical information. The proposed incomplete triple-modal MCI conversion prediction network is tailored for this purpose. Through the missing modal generation module, we synthesize the missing PET data from the magnetic resonance imaging and extract features using specifically designed encoders. We also develop a channel aggregation module and a triple-modal co-attention fusion module to reduce feature redundancy and achieve effective multimodal data fusion. Furthermore, we design a loss function to handle missing modality issues and align cross-modal features. These components collectively harness multimodal data to boost network performance. Experimental results on the ADNI1 and ADNI2 datasets show that our method significantly surpasses existing unimodal and other multimodal models.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a rising topic in video processing technologies and has important application value in consumer electronics. Currently, tracking-by-detection (TBD) is the dominant paradigm for MOT, which performs target detection and association frame by frame. However, the association performance of TBD methods degrades in complex scenes with heavy occlusions, which hinders the application of such methods in real-world scenarios.To this end, we incorporate pseudo-depth cues to enhance the association performance and propose Pseudo-Depth SORT (PD-SORT). First, we extend the Kalman filter state vector with pseudo-depth states. Second, we introduce a novel depth volume IoU (DVIoU) by combining the conventional 2D IoU with pseudo-depth. Furthermore, we develop a quantized pseudo-depth measurement (QPDM) strategy for more robust data association. Besides, we also integrate camera motion compensation (CMC) to handle dynamic camera situations. With the above designs, PD-SORT significantly alleviates the occlusion-induced ambiguous associations and achieves leading performances on DanceTrack, MOT17, and MOT20. Note that the improvement is especially obvious on DanceTrack, where objects show complex motions, similar appearances, and frequent occlusions.

While these methods demonstrate promising performance for single-modality image matching, they often struggle with multimodal data because the descriptors trained on single-modality data tend to lack robustness against the non-linear variations present in multimodal data. Extending such methods to multimodal image matching often requires well-aligned multimodal data to learn modality-invariant descriptors. However, acquiring such data is often costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a modality-invariant feature learning network (MIFNet) to compute modality-invariant features for keypoint descriptions in multimodal image matching using only single-modality training data. Specifically, we propose a novel latent feature aggregation module and a cumulative hybrid aggregation module to enhance the base keypoint descriptors trained on single-modality data by leveraging pre-trained features from Stable Diffusion models. We validate our method with recent keypoint detection and description methods in three multimodal retinal image datasets (CF-FA, CF-OCT, EMA-OCTA) and two remote sensing datasets (Optical-SAR and Optical-NIR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIFNet is able to learn modality-invariant feature for multimodal image matching without accessing the targeted modality and has good zero-shot generalization ability. The source code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Class activation map (CAM) has been widely used to highlight image regions that contribute to class predictions. Despite its simplicity and computational efficiency, CAM often struggles to identify discriminative regions that distinguish visually similar fine-grained classes. Prior efforts address this limitation by introducing more sophisticated explanation processes, but at the cost of extra complexity. In this paper, we propose Finer-CAM, a method that retains CAM's efficiency while achieving precise localization of discriminative regions. Our key insight is that the deficiency of CAM lies not in "how" it explains, but in "what" it explains}. Specifically, previous methods attempt to identify all cues contributing to the target class's logit value, which inadvertently also activates regions predictive of visually similar classes. By explicitly comparing the target class with similar classes and spotting their differences, Finer-CAM suppresses features shared with other classes and emphasizes the unique, discriminative details of the target class. Finer-CAM is easy to implement, compatible with various CAM methods, and can be extended to multi-modal models for accurate localization of specific concepts. Additionally, Finer-CAM allows adjustable comparison strength, enabling users to selectively highlight coarse object contours or fine discriminative details. Quantitatively, we show that masking out the top 5% of activated pixels by Finer-CAM results in a larger relative confidence drop compared to baselines.

- **Summary**: Recently, researchers have proposed many deep generative models, including generative adversarial networks(GANs) and denoising diffusion models. Although significant breakthroughs have been made and empirical success has been achieved with the GAN, its mathematical underpinnings remain relatively unknown. This paper focuses on a rigorous mathematical theoretical framework: the composite-functional-gradient GAN (CFG)[1]. Specifically, we reveal the theoretical connection between the CFG model and score-based models. We find that the training objective of the CFG discriminator is equivalent to finding an optimal D(x). The optimal gradient of D(x) differentiates the integral of the differences between the score functions of real and synthesized samples. Conversely, training the CFG generator involves finding an optimal G(x) that minimizes this difference. In this paper, we aim to derive an annealed weight preceding the weight of the CFG discriminator. This new explicit theoretical explanation model is called the annealed CFG method. To overcome the limitation of the annealed CFG method, as the method is not readily applicable to the SOTA GAN model, we propose a nested annealed training scheme (NATS). This scheme keeps the annealed weight from the CFG method and can be seamlessly adapted to various GAN models, no matter their structural, loss, or regularization differences. We conduct thorough experimental evaluations on various benchmark datasets for image generation. The results show that our annealed CFG and NATS methods significantly improve the quality and diversity of the synthesized samples. This improvement is clear when comparing the CFG method and the SOTA GAN models.

- **Summary**: Training-free diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable success in style transfer, eliminating the need for extensive training or fine-tuning. However, due to the lack of targeted training for style information extraction and constraints on the content image layout, training-free methods often suffer from layout changes of original content and content leakage from style images. Through a series of experiments, we discovered that an effective startpoint in the sampling stage significantly enhances the style transfer process. Based on this discovery, we propose StyleSSP, which focuses on obtaining a better startpoint to address layout changes of original content and content leakage from style image. StyleSSP comprises two key components: (1) Frequency Manipulation: To improve content preservation, we reduce the low-frequency components of the DDIM latent, allowing the sampling stage to pay more attention to the layout of content images; and (2) Negative Guidance via Inversion: To mitigate the content leakage from style image, we employ negative guidance in the inversion stage to ensure that the startpoint of the sampling stage is distanced from the content of style image. Experiments show that StyleSSP surpasses previous training-free style transfer baselines, particularly in preserving original content and minimizing the content leakage from style image.

- **Summary**: Virtual try-on (VTON) technology has gained attention due to its potential to transform online retail by enabling realistic clothing visualization of images and videos. However, most existing methods struggle to achieve high-quality results across image and video try-on tasks, especially in long video scenarios. In this work, we introduce CatV2TON, a simple and effective vision-based virtual try-on (V2TON) method that supports both image and video try-on tasks with a single diffusion transformer model. By temporally concatenating garment and person inputs and training on a mix of image and video datasets, CatV2TON achieves robust try-on performance across static and dynamic settings. For efficient long-video generation, we propose an overlapping clip-based inference strategy that uses sequential frame guidance and Adaptive Clip Normalization (AdaCN) to maintain temporal consistency with reduced resource demands. We also present ViViD-S, a refined video try-on dataset, achieved by filtering back-facing frames and applying 3D mask smoothing for enhanced temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CatV2TON outperforms existing methods in both image and video try-on tasks, offering a versatile and reliable solution for realistic virtual try-ons across diverse scenarios.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of video generation models has made it increasingly challenging to distinguish AI-generated videos from real ones. This issue underscores the urgent need for effective AI-generated video detectors to prevent the dissemination of false information through such videos. However, the development of high-performance generative video detectors is currently impeded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets specifically designed for generative video detection. To this end, we introduce GenVidBench, a challenging AI-generated video detection dataset with several key advantages: 1) Cross Source and Cross Generator: The cross-generation source mitigates the interference of video content on the detection. The cross-generator ensures diversity in video attributes between the training and test sets, preventing them from being overly similar. 2) State-of-the-Art Video Generators: The dataset includes videos from 8 state-of-the-art AI video generators, ensuring that it covers the latest advancements in the field of video generation. 3) Rich Semantics: The videos in GenVidBench are analyzed from multiple dimensions and classified into various semantic categories based on their content. This classification ensures that the dataset is not only large but also diverse, aiding in the development of more generalized and effective detection models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different advanced video generators and present a challenging setting. Additionally, we present rich experimental results including advanced video classification models as baselines. With the GenVidBench, researchers can efficiently develop and evaluate AI-generated video detection models. Datasets and code are available at https://genvidbench.github.io.

- **Summary**: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their immense potential in computer-aided diagnosis and decision-making. In the context of robotic-assisted surgery, MLLMs can serve as effective tools for surgical training and guidance. However, there is still a lack of MLLMs specialized for surgical scene understanding in clinical applications. In this work, we introduce EndoChat to address various dialogue paradigms and subtasks in surgical scene understanding that surgeons encounter. To train our EndoChat, we construct the Surg-396K dataset through a novel pipeline that systematically extracts surgical information and generates structured annotations based on collected large-scale endoscopic surgery datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-scale visual token interaction mechanism and a visual contrast-based reasoning mechanism to enhance the model's representation learning and reasoning capabilities. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across five dialogue paradigms and eight surgical scene understanding tasks. Additionally, we conduct evaluations with professional surgeons, most of whom provide positive feedback on collaborating with EndoChat. Overall, these results demonstrate that our EndoChat has great potential to significantly advance training and automation in robotic-assisted surgery.

The generated labels are then used as ground truth with the corresponding 4D radar data as inputs to a proposed semantic segmentation network, to associate a class label to each spatial voxel. Promising results are shown by applying both approaches to the publicly shared RaDelft dataset, with the proposed network achieving over 65% of the LiDAR detection performance, improving 13.2% in vehicle detection probability, and reducing 0.54 m in terms of Chamfer distance, compared to variants inspired from the literature.

- **Summary**: Flow-matching models provide a powerful framework for various applications, offering efficient sampling and flexible probability path modeling. These models are characterized by flows with low curvature in learned generative trajectories, which results in reduced truncation error at each sampling step. To further reduce curvature, we propose block matching. This novel approach leverages label information to partition the data distribution into blocks and match them with a prior distribution parameterized using the same label information, thereby learning straighter flows. We demonstrate that the variance of the prior distribution can control the curvature upper bound of forward trajectories in flow-matching models. By designing flexible regularization strategies to adjust this variance, we achieve optimal generation performance, effectively balancing the trade-off between maintaining diversity in generated samples and minimizing numerical solver errors. Our results demonstrate competitive performance with models of the same parameter scale.Code is available at \url{https://github.com/wpp13749/block_flow}.

- **Summary**: Despite coronary artery calcium scoring being considered a largely solved problem within the realm of medical artificial intelligence, this paper argues that significant improvements can still be made. By shifting the focus from pathology detection to a deeper understanding of anatomy, the novel algorithm proposed in the paper both achieves high accuracy in coronary artery calcium scoring and offers enhanced interpretability of the results. This approach not only aids in the precise quantification of calcifications in coronary arteries, but also provides valuable insights into the underlying anatomical structures. Through this anatomically-informed methodology, the paper shows how a nuanced understanding of the heart's anatomy can lead to more accurate and interpretable results in the field of cardiovascular health. We demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed method by evaluating it on an open-source multi-vendor dataset, where we obtain results at the inter-observer level, surpassing the current state of the art. Finally, the qualitative analyses show the practical value of the algorithm in such tasks as labeling coronary artery calcifications, identifying aortic calcifications, and filtering out false positive detections due to noise.

- **Summary**: The use of pretrained models from general computer vision tasks is widespread in remote sensing, significantly reducing training costs and improving performance. However, this practice also introduces vulnerabilities to downstream tasks, where publicly available pretrained models can be used as a proxy to compromise downstream models. This paper presents a novel Adversarial Neuron Manipulation method, which generates transferable perturbations by selectively manipulating single or multiple neurons in pretrained models. Unlike existing attacks, this method eliminates the need for domain-specific information, making it more broadly applicable and efficient. By targeting multiple fragile neurons, the perturbations achieve superior attack performance, revealing critical vulnerabilities in deep learning models. Experiments on diverse models and remote sensing datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This low-access adversarial neuron manipulation technique highlights a significant security risk in transfer learning models, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust defenses in their design when addressing the safety-critical remote sensing tasks.

- **Summary**: Pretrained visual-language models have made significant advancements in multimodal tasks, including image-text retrieval. However, a major challenge in image-text matching lies in language bias, where models predominantly rely on language priors and neglect to adequately consider the visual content. We thus present Multimodal ASsociation Score (MASS), a framework that reduces the reliance on language priors for better visual accuracy in image-text matching problems. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing visual-language models without necessitating additional training. Our experiments have shown that MASS effectively lessens language bias without losing an understanding of linguistic compositionality. Overall, MASS offers a promising solution for enhancing image-text matching performance in visual-language models.

- **Summary**: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial in real-world machine learning applications, particularly in safety-critical domains. Existing methods often leverage language information from vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance OOD detection by improving confidence estimation through rich class-wise text information. However, when building OOD detection score upon on in-distribution (ID) text-image affinity, existing works either focus on each ID class or whole ID label sets, overlooking inherent ID classes' connection. We find that the semantic information across different ID classes is beneficial for effective OOD detection. We thus investigate the ability of image-text comprehension among different semantic-related ID labels in VLMs and propose a novel post-hoc strategy called SimLabel. SimLabel enhances the separability between ID and OOD samples by establishing a more robust image-class similarity metric that considers consistency over a set of similar class labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SimLabel on various zero-shot OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model is also extended to various VLM-backbones, demonstrating its good generalization ability.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm, where multiple clients collaboratively train a global model by exchanging only model updates with the central server without sharing the local data of clients. Due to the large volume of model updates required to be transmitted between clients and the central server, most FL systems are associated with high transfer costs (i.e., communication overhead). This issue is more critical for operational applications in remote sensing (RS), especially when large-scale RS data is processed and analyzed through FL systems with restricted communication bandwidth. To address this issue, we introduce an explanation-guided pruning strategy for communication-efficient FL in the context of RS image classification. Our pruning strategy is defined based on the layerwise relevance propagation (LRP) driven explanations to: 1) efficiently and effectively identify the most relevant and informative model parameters (to be exchanged between clients and the central server); and 2) eliminate the non-informative ones to minimize the volume of model updates. The experimental results on the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset demonstrate that our strategy effectively reduces the number of shared model updates, while increasing the generalization ability of the global model. The code of this work will be publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FL-LRP

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown remarkable performance in novel view synthesis. However, its rendering quality deteriorates with sparse inphut views, leading to distorted content and reduced details. This limitation hinders its practical application. To address this issue, we propose a sparse-view 3DGS method. Given the inherently ill-posed nature of sparse-view rendering, incorporating prior information is crucial. We propose a semantic regularization technique, using features extracted from the pretrained DINO-ViT model, to ensure multi-view semantic consistency. Additionally, we propose local depth regularization, which constrains depth values to improve generalization on unseen views. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art novel view synthesis approaches, achieving up to 0.4dB improvement in terms of PSNR on the LLFF dataset, with reduced distortion and enhanced visual quality.

- **Summary**: Omnidirectional image quality assessment (OIQA) has been one of the hot topics in IQA with the continuous development of VR techniques, and achieved much success in the past few years. However, most studies devote themselves to the uniform distortion issue, i.e., all regions of an omnidirectional image are perturbed by the ``same amount'' of noise, while ignoring the non-uniform distortion issue, i.e., partial regions undergo ``different amount'' of perturbation with the other regions in the same omnidirectional image. Additionally, nearly all OIQA models are verified on the platforms containing a limited number of samples, which largely increases the over-fitting risk and therefore impedes the development of OIQA. To alleviate these issues, we elaborately explore this topic from both subjective and objective perspectives. Specifically, we construct a large OIQA database containing 10,320 non-uniformly distorted omnidirectional images, each of which is generated by considering quality impairments on one or two camera len(s). Then we meticulously conduct psychophysical experiments and delve into the influence of both holistic and individual factors (i.e., distortion range and viewing condition) on omnidirectional image quality. Furthermore, we propose a perception-guided OIQA model for non-uniform distortion by adaptively simulating users' viewing behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/RJL2000/OIQAND.

- **Summary**: Omnidirectional image quality assessment (OIQA) has been widely investigated in the past few years and achieved much success. However, most of existing studies are dedicated to solve the uniform distortion problem in OIQA, which has a natural gap with the non-uniform distortion problem, and their ability in capturing non-uniform distortion is far from satisfactory. To narrow this gap, in this paper, we propose a multitask auxiliary network for non-uniformly distorted omnidirectional images, where the parameters are optimized by jointly training the main task and other auxiliary tasks. The proposed network mainly consists of three parts: a backbone for extracting multiscale features from the viewport sequence, a multitask feature selection module for dynamically allocating specific features to different tasks, and auxiliary sub-networks for guiding the proposed model to capture local distortion and global quality change. Extensive experiments conducted on two large-scale OIQA databases demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art OIQA metrics, and these auxiliary sub-networks contribute to improve the performance of the proposed model.

- **Summary**: In this work, a new method for automatically extending Bounding Box (BB) and mask labels across different channels on multilens cameras is presented. For that purpose, the proposed method combines the well known phase correlation method with a refinement process. During the first step, images are aligned by localizing the peak of intensity obtained in the spatial domain after performing the cross correlation process in the frequency domain. The second step consists of obtaining the best possible transformation by using an iterative process maximising the IoU (Intersection over Union) metric. Results show that, by using this method, labels could be transferred across different lens on a camera with an accuracy over 90% in most cases and just by using 65 ms in the whole process. Once the transformations are obtained, artificial RGB images are generated, for labeling them so as to transfer this information into each of the other lens. This work will allow users to use this type of cameras in more fields rather than satellite or medical imagery, giving the chance of labeling even invisible objects in the visible spectrum.

- **Summary**: Capturing high dynamic range (HDR) scenes is one of the most important issues in camera design. Majority of cameras use exposure fusion technique, which fuses images captured by different exposure levels, to increase dynamic range. However, this approach can only handle images with limited exposure difference, normally 3-4 stops. When applying to very high dynamic scenes where a large exposure difference is required, this approach often fails due to incorrect alignment or inconsistent lighting between inputs, or tone mapping artifacts. In this work, we propose UltraFusion, the first exposure fusion technique that can merge input with 9 stops differences. The key idea is that we model the exposure fusion as a guided inpainting problem, where the under-exposed image is used as a guidance to fill the missing information of over-exposed highlight in the over-exposed region. Using under-exposed image as a soft guidance, instead of a hard constrain, our model is robust to potential alignment issue or lighting variations. Moreover, utilizing the image prior of the generative model, our model also generates natural tone mapping, even for very high-dynamic range scene. Our approach outperforms HDR-Transformer on latest HDR benchmarks. Moreover, to test its performance in ultra high dynamic range scene, we capture a new real-world exposure fusion benchmark, UltraFusion Dataset, with exposure difference up to 9 stops, and experiments show that \model~can generate beautiful and high-quality fusion results under various scenarios.

- **Summary**: As an affordable and convenient eye scan, fundus photography holds the potential for preventing vision impairment, especially in resource-limited regions. However, fundus image degradation is common under intricate imaging environments, impacting following diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, image quality assessment (IQA) and enhancement (IQE) are essential for ensuring the clinical value and reliability of fundus images. While existing reviews offer some overview of this field, a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between IQA and IQE, along with their clinical deployment challenges, is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by providing a thorough review of fundus IQA and IQE algorithms, research advancements, and practical applications. We outline the fundamentals of the fundus photography imaging system and the associated interferences, and then systematically summarize the paradigms in fundus IQA and IQE. Furthermore, we discuss the practical challenges and solutions in deploying IQA and IQE, as well as offer insights into potential future research directions.

- **Summary**: The objective of this paper is to provide a baseline for performing multi-modal data classification on a novel open multimodal dataset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which includes both image data (contrast-enhanced CT and MRI images) and tabular data (the clinical laboratory test data as well as case report forms). TNM staging is the classification task. Features from the vectorized preprocessed tabular data and radiomics features from contrast-enhanced CT and MRI images are collected. Feature selection is performed based on mutual information. An XGBoost classifier predicts the TNM staging and it shows a prediction accuracy of $0.89 \pm 0.05$ and an AUC of $0.93 \pm 0.03$. The classifier shows that this high level of prediction accuracy can only be obtained by combining image and clinical laboratory data and therefore is a good example case where multi-model classification is mandatory to achieve accurate results.

- **Summary**: Egomotion estimation is crucial for applications such as autonomous navigation and robotics, where accurate and real-time motion tracking is required. However, traditional methods relying on inertial sensors are highly sensitive to external conditions, and suffer from drifts leading to large inaccuracies over long distances. Vision-based methods, particularly those utilising event-based vision sensors, provide an efficient alternative by capturing data only when changes are perceived in the scene. This approach minimises power consumption while delivering high-speed, low-latency feedback. In this work, we propose a fully event-based pipeline for egomotion estimation that processes the event stream directly within the event-based domain. This method eliminates the need for frame-based intermediaries, allowing for low-latency and energy-efficient motion estimation. We construct a shallow spiking neural network using a synaptic gating mechanism to convert precise event timing into bursts of spikes. These spikes encode local optical flow velocities, and the network provides an event-based readout of egomotion. We evaluate the network's performance on a dedicated chip, demonstrating strong potential for low-latency, low-power motion estimation. Additionally, simulations of larger networks show that the system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in egomotion estimation tasks with event-based cameras, making it a promising solution for real-time, power-constrained robotics applications.



### Teaching Large Language Models to Regress Accurate Image Quality Scores using Score Distribution

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), MLLM-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods have shown promising performance in linguistic quality description. However, current methods still fall short in accurately scoring image quality. In this work, we aim to leverage MLLMs to regress accurate quality scores. A key challenge is that the quality score is inherently continuous, typically modeled as a Gaussian distribution, whereas MLLMs generate discrete token outputs. This mismatch necessitates score discretization. Previous approaches discretize the mean score into a one-hot label, resulting in information loss and failing to capture inter-image relationships. We propose a distribution-based approach that discretizes the score distribution into a soft label. This method preserves the characteristics of the score distribution, achieving high accuracy and maintaining inter-image relationships. Moreover, to address dataset variation, where different IQA datasets exhibit various distributions, we introduce a fidelity loss based on Thurstone's model. This loss captures intra-dataset relationships, facilitating co-training across multiple IQA datasets. With these designs, we develop the distribution-based Depicted image Quality Assessment model for Score regression (DeQA-Score). Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DeQA-Score stably outperforms baselines in score regression. Also, DeQA-Score can predict the score distribution that closely aligns with human annotations. Codes and model weights have been released in https://depictqa.github.io/deqa-score/.

- **Summary**: The differentiable shift-variant filtered backprojection (FBP) model enables the reconstruction of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) data for any non-circular trajectories. This method employs deep learning technique to estimate the redundancy weights required for reconstruction, given knowledge of the specific trajectory at optimization time. However, computing the redundancy weight for each projection remains computationally intensive. This paper presents a novel approach to compress and optimize the differentiable shift-variant FBP model based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We apply PCA to the redundancy weights learned from sinusoidal trajectory projection data, revealing significant parameter redundancy in the original model. By integrating PCA directly into the differentiable shift-variant FBP reconstruction pipeline, we develop a method that decomposes the redundancy weight layer parameters into a trainable eigenvector matrix, compressed weights, and a mean vector. This innovative technique achieves a remarkable 97.25% reduction in trainable parameters without compromising reconstruction accuracy. As a result, our algorithm significantly decreases the complexity of the differentiable shift-variant FBP model and greatly improves training speed. These improvements make the model substantially more practical for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: We explore the ability of two LLMs -- GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 -- to transcribe historical handwritten documents in a tabular format and compare their performance to traditional OCR/HTR systems: EasyOCR, Keras, Pytesseract, and TrOCR. Considering the tabular form of the data, two types of experiments are executed: one where the images are split line by line and the other where the entire scan is used as input. Based on CER and BLEU, we demonstrate that LLMs outperform the conventional OCR/HTR methods. Moreover, we also compare the evaluated CER and BLEU scores to human evaluations to better judge the outputs of whole-scan experiments and understand influential factors for CER and BLEU. Combining judgments from all the evaluation metrics, we conclude that two-shot GPT-4o for line-by-line images and two-shot Claude Sonnet 3.5 for whole-scan images yield the transcriptions of the historical records most similar to the ground truth.

- **Summary**: Images depicting complex, dynamic scenes are challenging to parse automatically, requiring both high-level comprehension of the overall situation and fine-grained identification of participating entities and their interactions. Current approaches use distinct methods tailored to sub-tasks such as Situation Recognition and detection of Human-Human and Human-Object Interactions. However, recent advances in image understanding have often leveraged web-scale vision-language (V&L) representations to obviate task-specific engineering. In this work, we propose a framework for dynamic scene understanding tasks by leveraging knowledge from modern, frozen V&L representations. By framing these tasks in a generic manner - as predicting and parsing structured text, or by directly concatenating representations to the input of existing models - we achieve state-of-the-art results while using a minimal number of trainable parameters relative to existing approaches. Moreover, our analysis of dynamic knowledge of these representations shows that recent, more powerful representations effectively encode dynamic scene semantics, making this approach newly possible.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown great potential to improve early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia based on imaging data. However, these methods have yet to be widely adopted in clinical practice, possibly due to the limited interpretability of deep learning models. The Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is a glass-box model but cannot learn features directly from input imaging data. In this study, we propose a novel interpretable model that combines CNNs and EBMs for the diagnosis and prediction of AD. We develop an innovative training strategy that alternatingly trains the CNN component as a feature extractor and the EBM component as the output block to form an end-to-end model. The model takes imaging data as input and provides both predictions and interpretable feature importance measures. We validated the proposed model on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and the Health-RI Parelsnoer Neurodegenerative Diseases Biobank (PND) as an external testing set. The proposed model achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.956 for AD and control classification, and 0.694 for the prediction of conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD on the ADNI cohort. The proposed model is a glass-box model that achieves a comparable performance with other state-of-the-art black-box models.

- **Summary**: State Space Models (SSMs) have recently enjoyed a rise to prominence in the field of deep learning for sequence modeling, especially as an alternative to Transformers. Their success stems from avoiding two well-known drawbacks of attention-based models: quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence length and inability to model long-range dependencies. The SSM variant Mamba has demonstrated performance comparable to Transformers without any form of attention, thanks to the use of a selective mechanism for the state parameters. Selectivity, however, is only evaluated empirically and the reasons of its effectiveness remain unclear. In this work, we show how selectivity is related to the sequence processing. Our analysis shows that selective time intervals in Mamba act as linear approximators of information. Then, we propose our SeRpEnt architecture, a SSM that further exploits selectivity to compress sequences in an information-aware fashion. It employs a resampling mechanism that aggregates elements based on their information content. Our empirical results in the Long Range Arena benchmark and other language modeling tasks show benefits of the SeRpEnt's resampling mechanism.

- **Summary**: Smartphones have become indispensable in modern life, yet navigating complex tasks on mobile devices often remains frustrating. Recent advancements in large multimodal model (LMM)-based mobile agents have demonstrated the ability to perceive and act in mobile environments. However, current approaches face significant limitations: they fall short in addressing real-world human needs, struggle with reasoning-intensive and long-horizon tasks, and lack mechanisms to learn and improve from prior experiences. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Mobile-Agent-E, a hierarchical multi-agent framework capable of self-evolution through past experience. By hierarchical, we mean an explicit separation of high-level planning and low-level action execution. The framework comprises a Manager, responsible for devising overall plans by breaking down complex tasks into subgoals, and four subordinate agents--Perceptor, Operator, Action Reflector, and Notetaker--which handle fine-grained visual perception, immediate action execution, error verification, and information aggregation, respectively. Mobile-Agent-E also features a novel self-evolution module which maintains a persistent long-term memory comprising Tips and Shortcuts. Tips are general guidance and lessons learned from prior tasks on how to effectively interact with the environment. Shortcuts are reusable, executable sequences of atomic operations tailored for specific subroutines. The inclusion of Tips and Shortcuts facilitates continuous refinement in performance and efficiency. Alongside this framework, we introduce Mobile-Eval-E, a new benchmark featuring complex mobile tasks requiring long-horizon, multi-app interactions. Empirical results show that Mobile-Agent-E achieves a 22% absolute improvement over previous state-of-the-art approaches across three foundation model backbones.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is an important analysis task in clinical practice and research. Deep learning has massively advanced the field, but current approaches are mostly based on models trained for a specific task. Training such models or adapting them to a new condition is costly due to the need for (manually) labeled data. The emergence of vision foundation models, especially Segment Anything, offers a path to universal segmentation for medical images, overcoming these issues. Here, we study how to improve Segment Anything for medical images by comparing different finetuning strategies on a large and diverse dataset. We evaluate the finetuned models on a wide range of interactive and (automatic) semantic segmentation tasks. We find that the performance can be clearly improved for interactive segmentation. However, semantic segmentation does not benefit from pretraining on medical images. Our best model, MedicoSAM, is publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/medico-sam. We show that it is compatible with existing tools for data annotation and believe that it will be of great practical value.

- **Summary**: Tracking multiple faces is a difficult problem, as there may be partially occluded or lateral faces. In multiple face tracking, association is typically based on (biometric) face features. However, the models used to extract these face features usually require frontal face images, which can limit the tracking performance. In this work, a multi-face tracking method inspired by StrongSort, FaceSORT, is proposed. To mitigate the problem of partially occluded or lateral faces, biometric face features are combined with visual appearance features (i.e., generated by a generic object classifier), with both features are extracted from the same face patch. A comprehensive experimental evaluation is performed, including a comparison of different face descriptors, an evaluation of different parameter settings, and the application of a different similarity metric. All experiments are conducted with a new multi-face tracking dataset and a subset of the ChokePoint dataset. The `Paris Lodron University Salzburg Faces in a Queue' dataset consists of a total of seven fully annotated sequences (12730 frames) and is made publicly available as part of this work. Together with this dataset, annotations of 6 sequences from the ChokePoint dataset are also provided.

- **Summary**: Consistent improvement of image priors over the years has led to the development of better inverse problem solvers. Diffusion models are the newcomers to this arena, posing the strongest known prior to date. Recently, such models operating in a latent space have become increasingly predominant due to their efficiency. In recent works, these models have been applied to solve inverse problems. Working in the latent space typically requires multiple applications of an Autoencoder during the restoration process, which leads to both computational and restoration quality challenges. In this work, we propose a new approach for handling inverse problems with latent diffusion models, where a learned degradation function operates within the latent space, emulating a known image space degradation. Usage of the learned operator reduces the dependency on the Autoencoder to only the initial and final steps of the restoration process, facilitating faster sampling and superior restoration quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of image restoration tasks and datasets, achieving significant improvements over prior art.

- **Summary**: Racial bias in medicine, particularly in dermatology, presents significant ethical and clinical challenges. It often results from the underrepresentation of darker skin tones in training datasets for machine learning models. While efforts to address bias in dermatology have focused on improving dataset diversity and mitigating disparities in discriminative models, the impact of racial bias on generative models remains underexplored. Generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), are increasingly used in healthcare applications, yet their fairness across diverse skin tones is currently not well understood. In this study, we evaluate the fairness of generative models in clinical dermatology with respect to racial bias. For this purpose, we first train a VAE with a perceptual loss to generate and reconstruct high-quality skin images across different skin tones. We utilize the Fitzpatrick17k dataset to examine how racial bias influences the representation and performance of these models. Our findings indicate that the VAE is influenced by the diversity of skin tones in the training dataset, with better performance observed for lighter skin tones. Additionally, the uncertainty estimates produced by the VAE are ineffective in assessing the model's fairness. These results highlight the need for improved uncertainty quantification mechanisms to detect and address racial bias in generative models for trustworthy healthcare technologies.

- **Summary**: Current self-supervised learning methods for 3D medical imaging rely on simple pretext formulations and organ- or modality-specific datasets, limiting their generalizability and scalability. We present 3DINO, a cutting-edge SSL method adapted to 3D datasets, and use it to pretrain 3DINO-ViT: a general-purpose medical imaging model, on an exceptionally large, multimodal, and multi-organ dataset of ~100,000 3D medical imaging scans from over 10 organs. We validate 3DINO-ViT using extensive experiments on numerous medical imaging segmentation and classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that 3DINO-ViT generalizes across modalities and organs, including out-of-distribution tasks and datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the majority of evaluation metrics and labeled dataset sizes.

- **Summary**: Distracted driving remains a significant global challenge with severe human and economic repercussions, demanding improved detection and intervention strategies. While previous studies have extensively explored single-modality approaches, recent research indicates that these systems often fall short in identifying complex distraction patterns, particularly cognitive distractions. This systematic review addresses critical gaps by providing a comprehensive analysis of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques applied across various data modalities - visual,, sensory, auditory, and multimodal. By categorizing and evaluating studies based on modality, data accessibility, and methodology, this review clarifies which approaches yield the highest accuracy and are best suited for specific distracted driving detection goals. The findings offer clear guidance on the advantages of multimodal versus single-modal systems and capture the latest advancements in the field. Ultimately, this review contributes valuable insights for developing robust distracted driving detection frameworks, supporting enhanced road safety and mitigation strategies.

- **Summary**: Would not it be much more convenient for everybody to try on clothes by only looking into a mirror ? The answer to that problem is virtual try-on, enabling users to digitally experiment with outfits. The core challenge lies in realistic image-to-image translation, where clothing must fit diverse human forms, poses, and figures. Early methods, which used 2D transformations, offered speed, but image quality was often disappointing and lacked the nuance of deep learning. Though GAN-based techniques enhanced realism, their dependence on paired data proved limiting. More adaptable methods offered great visuals but demanded significant computing power and time. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise for high-fidelity translation, yet the current crop of virtual try-on tools still struggle with detail loss and warping issues. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes EfficientVITON, a new virtual try-on system leveraging the impressive pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for better images and deployment feasibility. The system includes a spatial encoder to maintain clothings finer details and zero cross-attention blocks to capture the subtleties of how clothes fit a human body. Input images are carefully prepared, and the diffusion process has been tweaked to significantly cut generation time without image quality loss. The training process involves two distinct stages of fine-tuning, carefully incorporating a balance of loss functions to ensure both accurate try-on results and high-quality visuals. Rigorous testing on the VITON-HD dataset, supplemented with real-world examples, has demonstrated that EfficientVITON achieves state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Explaining deep learning models in a way that humans can easily understand is essential for responsible artificial intelligence applications. Attribution methods constitute an important area of explainable deep learning. The attribution problem involves finding parts of the network's input that are the most responsible for the model's output. In this work, we demonstrate that implicit neural representations (INRs) constitute a good framework for generating visual explanations. Firstly, we utilize coordinate-based implicit networks to reformulate and extend the extremal perturbations technique and generate attribution masks. Experimental results confirm the usefulness of our method. For instance, by proper conditioning of the implicit network, we obtain attribution masks that are well-behaved with respect to the imposed area constraints. Secondly, we present an iterative INR-based method that can be used to generate multiple non-overlapping attribution masks for the same image. We depict that a deep learning model may associate the image label with both the appearance of the object of interest as well as with areas and textures usually accompanying the object. Our study demonstrates that implicit networks are well-suited for the generation of attribution masks and can provide interesting insights about the performance of deep learning models.
