- **Summary**: Mean texture depth (MTD) is pivotal in assessing the skid resistance of asphalt pavements and ensuring road safety. This study focuses on developing an automated system for extracting texture features and evaluating MTD based on pavement images. The contributions of this work are threefold: firstly, it proposes an economical method to acquire three-dimensional (3D) pavement texture data; secondly, it enhances 3D image processing techniques and formulates features that represent various aspects of texture; thirdly, it establishes multivariate prediction models that link these features with MTD values. Validation results demonstrate that the Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) model achieves remarkable prediction stability and accuracy (R2 = 0.9858), and field tests indicate the superiority of the proposed method over other techniques, with relative errors below 10%. This method offers a comprehensive end-to-end solution for pavement quality evaluation, from images input to MTD predictions output.

- **Summary**: Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) has emerged as a promising implicit neural representation (INR) approach for video analysis, which represents videos as neural networks with frame indexes as inputs. However, NeRV-based methods are time-consuming when adapting to a large number of diverse videos, as each video requires a separate NeRV model to be trained from scratch. In addition, NeRV-based methods spatially require generating a high-dimension signal (i.e., an entire image) from the input of a low-dimension timestamp, and a video typically consists of tens of frames temporally that have a minor change between adjacent frames. To improve the efficiency of video representation, we propose Meta Neural Representations for Videos, named MetaNeRV, a novel framework for fast NeRV representation for unseen videos. MetaNeRV leverages a meta-learning framework to learn an optimal parameter initialization, which serves as a good starting point for adapting to new videos. To address the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of video modality, we further introduce spatial-temporal guidance to improve the representation capabilities of MetaNeRV. Specifically, the spatial guidance with a multi-resolution loss aims to capture the information from different resolution stages, and the temporal guidance with an effective progressive learning strategy could gradually refine the number of fitted frames during the meta-learning process. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of MetaNeRV for video representations and video compression.

- **Summary**: Recently, the state-of-art models for medical image segmentation is U-Net and their variants. These networks, though succeeding in deriving notable results, ignore the practical problem hanging over the medical segmentation field: overfitting and small dataset. The over-complicated deep neural networks unnecessarily extract meaningless information, and a majority of them are not suitable for lung slice CT image segmentation task. To overcome the two limitations, we proposed a new whole-process network merging advanced UNet++ model. The network comprises three main modules: data augmentation, optimized neural network, parameter fine-tuning. By incorporating diverse methods, the training results demonstrate a significant advantage over similar works, achieving leading accuracy of 98.03% with the lowest overfitting. potential. Our network is remarkable as one of the first to target on lung slice CT images.

- **Summary**: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable effectiveness for multi-modal tasks due to their abilities to generate and understand cross-modal data. However, processing long sequences of visual tokens extracted from visual backbones poses a challenge for deployment in real-time applications. To address this issue, we introduce FOLDER, a simple yet effective plug-and-play module designed to reduce the length of the visual token sequence, mitigating both computational and memory demands during training and inference. Through a comprehensive analysis of the token reduction process, we analyze the information loss introduced by different reduction strategies and develop FOLDER to preserve key information while removing visual redundancy. We showcase the effectiveness of FOLDER by integrating it into the visual backbone of several MLLMs, significantly accelerating the inference phase. Furthermore, we evaluate its utility as a training accelerator or even performance booster for MLLMs. In both contexts, FOLDER achieves comparable or even better performance than the original models, while dramatically reducing complexity by removing up to 70% of visual tokens.

- **Summary**: This article investigates the critical issue of dataset bias in medical imaging, with a particular emphasis on racial disparities caused by uneven population distribution in dataset collection. Our analysis reveals that medical segmentation datasets are significantly biased, primarily influenced by the demographic composition of their collection sites. For instance, Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (SLO) fundus datasets collected in the United States predominantly feature images of White individuals, with minority racial groups underrepresented. This imbalance can result in biased model performance and inequitable clinical outcomes, particularly for minority populations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training set search strategy aimed at reducing these biases by focusing on underrepresented racial groups. Our approach utilizes existing datasets and employs a simple greedy algorithm to identify source images that closely match the target domain distribution. By selecting training data that aligns more closely with the characteristics of minority populations, our strategy improves the accuracy of medical segmentation models on specific minorities, i.e., Black. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating bias. We also discuss the broader societal implications, highlighting how addressing these disparities can contribute to more equitable healthcare outcomes.

- **Summary**: Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) are widely used for high-quality image generation and medical image segmentation but often rely on Unet-based architectures, leading to high computational overhead, especially with high-resolution images. This work proposes three NCA-based improvements for diffusion-based medical image segmentation. First, Multi-MedSegDiffNCA uses a multilevel NCA framework to refine rough noise estimates generated by lower level NCA models. Second, CBAM-MedSegDiffNCA incorporates channel and spatial attention for improved segmentation. Third, MultiCBAM-MedSegDiffNCA combines these methods with a new RGB channel loss for semantic guidance. Evaluations on Lesion segmentation show that MultiCBAM-MedSegDiffNCA matches Unet-based model performance with dice score of 87.84% while using 60-110 times fewer parameters, offering a more efficient solution for low resource medical settings.

- **Summary**: Collaborative perception significantly enhances autonomous driving safety by extending each vehicle's perception range through message sharing among connected and autonomous vehicles. Unfortunately, it is also vulnerable to adversarial message attacks from malicious agents, resulting in severe performance degradation. While existing defenses employ hypothesis-and-verification frameworks to detect malicious agents based on single-shot outliers, they overlook temporal message correlations, which can be circumvented by subtle yet harmful perturbations in model input and output spaces. This paper reveals a novel blind area confusion (BAC) attack that compromises existing single-shot outlier-based detection methods. As a countermeasure, we propose GCP, a Guarded Collaborative Perception framework based on spatial-temporal aware malicious agent detection, which maintains single-shot spatial consistency through a confidence-scaled spatial concordance loss, while simultaneously examining temporal anomalies by reconstructing historical bird's eye view motion flows in low-confidence regions. We also employ a joint spatial-temporal Benjamini-Hochberg test to synthesize dual-domain anomaly results for reliable malicious agent detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate GCP's superior performance under diverse attack scenarios, achieving up to 34.69% improvements in AP@0.5 compared to the state-of-the-art CP defense strategies under BAC attacks, while maintaining consistent 5-8% improvements under other typical attacks. Code will be released at https://github.com/CP-Security/GCP.git.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning, a prominent approach within self-supervised learning, has demonstrated significant effectiveness in developing generalizable models for various applications involving natural images. However, recent research indicates that these successes do not necessarily extend to the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we investigate the reasons for this suboptimal performance and hypothesize that the dense distribution of medical images poses challenges to the pretext tasks in contrastive learning, particularly in constructing positive and negative pairs. We explore model performance under different augmentation strategies and compare the results to those achieved with strong augmentations. Our study includes six publicly available datasets covering multiple clinically relevant tasks. We further assess the model's generalizability through external evaluations. The model pre-trained with weak augmentation outperforms those with strong augmentation, improving AUROC from 0.838 to 0.848 and AUPR from 0.523 to 0.597 on MESSIDOR2, and showing similar enhancements across other datasets. Our findings suggest that optimizing the scale of augmentation is critical for enhancing the efficacy of contrastive learning in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Ray tracing is widely employed to model the propagation of radio-frequency (RF) signal in complex environment. The modelling performance greatly depends on how accurately the target scene can be depicted, including the scene geometry and surface material properties. The advances in computer vision and LiDAR make scene geometry estimation increasingly accurate, but there still lacks scalable and efficient approaches to estimate the material reflectivity in real-world environment. In this work, we tackle this problem by learning the material reflectivity efficiently from the path loss of the RF signal from the transmitters to receivers. Specifically, we want the learned material reflection coefficients to minimize the gap between the predicted and measured powers of the receivers. We achieve this by translating the neural reflectance field from optics to RF domain by modelling both the amplitude and phase of RF signals to account for the multipath effects. We further propose a differentiable RF ray tracing framework that optimizes the neural reflectance field to match the signal strength measurements. We simulate a complex real-world environment for experiments and our simulation results show that the neural reflectance field can successfully learn the reflection coefficients for all incident angles. As a result, our approach achieves better accuracy in predicting the powers of receivers with significantly less training data compared to existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing data is often distributed across multiple institutions, and due to privacy concerns and data-sharing restrictions, leveraging large-scale datasets in a centralized training framework is challenging. Federated learning offers a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across distributed data sources without requiring data centralization. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which typically contain billions of parameters, pose significant communication challenges for traditional federated learning approaches based on model parameter updates, as they would incur substantial communication costs. In this paper, we propose FedRSCLIP, the first federated learning framework designed for remote sensing image classification based on a VLM, specifically CLIP. FedRSCLIP addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity and large-scale model transmission in federated environments by introducing Prompt Learning, which optimizes only a small set of tunable parameters. The framework introduces a dual-prompt mechanism, comprising Shared Prompts for global knowledge sharing and Private Prompts for client-specific adaptation. To maintain semantic coherence between shared and private prompts, we propose the Dual Prompt Alignment Constraint to balance global consistency and local adaptability across diverse client distributions. Additionally, to enhance cross-modal representation learning, we introduce the Cross-Modal Feature Alignment Constraint to align multimodal features between text and image prompts. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we construct a Fed-RSIC dataset based on three existing remote sensing image classification datasets, specifically designed to simulate various federated learning configurations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of FedRSCLIP in remote sensing image classification.

- **Summary**: While recent depth estimation methods exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, achieving accurate metric depth across diverse camera types-particularly those with large fields of view (FoV) such as fisheye and 360-degree cameras-remains a significant challenge. This paper presents Depth Any Camera (DAC), a powerful zero-shot metric depth estimation framework that extends a perspective-trained model to effectively handle cameras with varying FoVs. The framework is designed to ensure that all existing 3D data can be leveraged, regardless of the specific camera types used in new applications. Remarkably, DAC is trained exclusively on perspective images but generalizes seamlessly to fisheye and 360-degree cameras without the need for specialized training data. DAC employs Equi-Rectangular Projection (ERP) as a unified image representation, enabling consistent processing of images with diverse FoVs. Its key components include a pitch-aware Image-to-ERP conversion for efficient online augmentation in ERP space, a FoV alignment operation to support effective training across a wide range of FoVs, and multi-resolution data augmentation to address resolution disparities between training and testing. DAC achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot metric depth estimation, improving delta-1 ($\delta_1$) accuracy by up to 50% on multiple fisheye and 360-degree datasets compared to prior metric depth foundation models, demonstrating robust generalization across camera types.



### DeTrack: In-model Latent Denoising Learning for Visual Object Tracking

- **Summary**: Previous visual object tracking methods employ image-feature regression models or coordinate autoregression models for bounding box prediction. Image-feature regression methods heavily depend on matching results and do not utilize positional prior, while the autoregressive approach can only be trained using bounding boxes available in the training set, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance during testing with unseen data. Inspired by the diffusion model, denoising learning enhances the model's robustness to unseen data. Therefore, We introduce noise to bounding boxes, generating noisy boxes for training, thus enhancing model robustness on testing data. We propose a new paradigm to formulate the visual object tracking problem as a denoising learning process. However, tracking algorithms are usually asked to run in real-time, directly applying the diffusion model to object tracking would severely impair tracking speed. Therefore, we decompose the denoising learning process into every denoising block within a model, not by running the model multiple times, and thus we summarize the proposed paradigm as an in-model latent denoising learning process. Specifically, we propose a denoising Vision Transformer (ViT), which is composed of multiple denoising blocks. In the denoising block, template and search embeddings are projected into every denoising block as conditions. A denoising block is responsible for removing the noise in a predicted bounding box, and multiple stacked denoising blocks cooperate to accomplish the whole denoising process. Subsequently, we utilize image features and trajectory information to refine the denoised bounding box. Besides, we also utilize trajectory memory and visual memory to improve tracking stability. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive performance on several challenging datasets.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing object detection is particularly challenging due to the high resolution, multi-scale features, and diverse ground object characteristics inherent in satellite and UAV imagery. These challenges necessitate more advanced approaches for effective object detection in such environments. While deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in remote sensing object detection, they typically rely on large amounts of labeled data. Acquiring sufficient labeled data, particularly for novel or rare objects, is both challenging and time-consuming in remote sensing scenarios, limiting the generalization capabilities of existing models. To address these challenges, few-shot learning (FSL) has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models to learn new classes from limited labeled examples. Building on this concept, few-shot object detection (FSOD) specifically targets object detection challenges in data-limited conditions. However, the generalization capability of FSOD models, particularly in remote sensing, is often constrained by the complex and diverse characteristics of the objects present in such environments. In this paper, we propose the Generalization-Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection (GE-FSOD) model to improve the generalization capability in remote sensing FSOD tasks. Our model introduces three key innovations: the Cross-Level Fusion Pyramid Attention Network (CFPAN) for enhanced multi-scale feature representation, the Multi-Stage Refinement Region Proposal Network (MRRPN) for more accurate region proposals, and the Generalized Classification Loss (GCL) for improved classification performance in few-shot scenarios. Extensive experiments on the DIOR and NWPU VHR-10 datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for few-shot object detection in remote sensing.



### Noise-Tolerant Hybrid Prototypical Learning with Noisy Web Data

- **Summary**: We focus on the challenging problem of learning an unbiased classifier from a large number of potentially relevant but noisily labeled web images given only a few clean labeled images. This problem is particularly practical because it reduces the expensive annotation costs by utilizing freely accessible web images with noisy labels. Typically, prototypes are representative images or features used to classify or identify other images. However, in the few clean and many noisy scenarios, the class prototype can be severely biased due to the presence of irrelevant noisy images. The resulting prototypes are less compact and discriminative, as previous methods do not take into account the diverse range of images in the noisy web image collections. On the other hand, the relation modeling between noisy and clean images is not learned for the class prototype generation in an end-to-end manner, which results in a suboptimal class prototype. In this article, we introduce a similarity maximization loss named SimNoiPro. Our SimNoiPro first generates noise-tolerant hybrid prototypes composed of clean and noise-tolerant prototypes and then pulls them closer to each other. Our approach considers the diversity of noisy images by explicit division and overcomes the optimization discrepancy issue. This enables better relation modeling between clean and noisy images and helps extract judicious information from the noisy image set. The evaluation results on two extended few-shot classification benchmarks confirm that our SimNoiPro outperforms prior methods in measuring image relations and cleaning noisy data.



### A Deep Positive-Negative Prototype Approach to Integrated Prototypical Discriminative Learning

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel Deep Positive-Negative Prototype (DPNP) model that combines prototype-based learning (PbL) with discriminative methods to improve class compactness and separability in deep neural networks. While PbL traditionally emphasizes interpretability by classifying samples based on their similarity to representative prototypes, it struggles with creating optimal decision boundaries in complex scenarios. Conversely, discriminative methods effectively separate classes but often lack intuitive interpretability. Toward exploiting advantages of these two approaches, the suggested DPNP model bridges between them by unifying class prototypes with weight vectors, thereby establishing a structured latent space that enables accurate classification using interpretable prototypes alongside a properly learned feature representation. Based on this central idea of unified prototype-weight representation, Deep Positive Prototype (DPP) is formed in the latent space as a representative for each class using off-the-shelf deep networks as feature extractors. Then, rival neighboring class DPPs are treated as implicit negative prototypes with repulsive force in DPNP, which push away DPPs from each other. This helps to enhance inter-class separation without the need for any extra parameters. Hence, through a novel loss function that integrates cross-entropy, prototype alignment, and separation terms, DPNP achieves well-organized feature space geometry, maximizing intra-class compactness and inter-class margins. We show that DPNP can organize prototypes in nearly regular positions within feature space, such that it is possible to achieve competitive classification accuracy even in much lower-dimensional feature spaces. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that DPNP outperforms state-of-the-art models, while using smaller networks.

- **Summary**: We report ACE++, an instruction-based diffusion framework that tackles various image generation and editing tasks. Inspired by the input format for the inpainting task proposed by FLUX.1-Fill-dev, we improve the Long-context Condition Unit (LCU) introduced in ACE and extend this input paradigm to any editing and generation tasks. To take full advantage of image generative priors, we develop a two-stage training scheme to minimize the efforts of finetuning powerful text-to-image diffusion models like FLUX.1-dev. In the first stage, we pre-train the model using task data with the 0-ref tasks from the text-to-image model. There are many models in the community based on the post-training of text-to-image foundational models that meet this training paradigm of the first stage. For example, FLUX.1-Fill-dev deals primarily with painting tasks and can be used as an initialization to accelerate the training process. In the second stage, we finetune the above model to support the general instructions using all tasks defined in ACE. To promote the widespread application of ACE++ in different scenarios, we provide a comprehensive set of models that cover both full finetuning and lightweight finetuning, while considering general applicability and applicability in vertical scenarios. The qualitative analysis showcases the superiority of ACE++ in terms of generating image quality and prompt following ability. Code and models will be available on the project page: https://ali-vilab. github.io/ACE_plus_page/.

- **Summary**: The goal of video moment retrieval and highlight detection is to identify specific segments and highlights based on a given text query. With the rapid growth of video content and the overlap between these tasks, recent works have addressed both simultaneously. However, they still struggle to fully capture the overall video context, making it challenging to determine which words are most relevant. In this paper, we present a novel Video Context-aware Keyword Attention module that overcomes this limitation by capturing keyword variation within the context of the entire video. To achieve this, we introduce a video context clustering module that provides concise representations of the overall video context, thereby enhancing the understanding of keyword dynamics. Furthermore, we propose a keyword weight detection module with keyword-aware contrastive learning that incorporates keyword information to enhance fine-grained alignment between visual and textual features. Extensive experiments on the QVHighlights, TVSum, and Charades-STA benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves performance in moment retrieval and highlight detection tasks compared to existing approaches.

- **Summary**: For many practical applications, a high computational cost of inference over deep network architectures might be unacceptable. A small degradation in the overall inference accuracy might be a reasonable price to pay for a significant reduction in the required computational resources. In this work, we describe a method for introducing "shortcuts" into the DNN feedforward inference process by skipping costly feedforward computations whenever possible. The proposed method is based on the previously described BranchyNet (Teerapittayanon et al., 2016) and the EEnet (Demir, 2019) architectures that jointly train the main network and early exit branches. We extend those methods by attaching branches to pre-trained models and, thus, eliminating the need to alter the original weights of the network. We also suggest a new branch architecture based on convolutional building blocks to allow enough training capacity when applied on large DNNs. The proposed architecture includes confidence heads that are used for predicting the confidence level in the corresponding early exits. By defining adjusted thresholds on these confidence extensions, we can control in real-time the amount of data exiting from each branch and the overall tradeoff between speed and accuracy of our model. In our experiments, we evaluate our method using image datasets (SVHN and CIFAR10) and several DNN architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, VGG) with varied depth. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables us to reduce the average inference computational cost and further controlling the tradeoff between the model accuracy and the computation cost.

- **Summary**: Facial attractiveness prediction (FAP) has long been an important computer vision task, which could be widely applied in live streaming for facial retouching, content recommendation, etc. However, previous FAP datasets are either small, closed-source, or lack diversity. Moreover, the corresponding FAP models exhibit limited generalization and adaptation ability. To overcome these limitations, in this paper we present LiveBeauty, the first large-scale live-specific FAP dataset, in a more challenging application scenario, i.e., live streaming. 10,000 face images are collected from a live streaming platform directly, with 200,000 corresponding attractiveness annotations obtained from a well-devised subjective experiment, making LiveBeauty the largest open-access FAP dataset in the challenging live scenario. Furthermore, a multi-modal FAP method is proposed to measure the facial attractiveness in live streaming. Specifically, we first extract holistic facial prior knowledge and multi-modal aesthetic semantic features via a Personalized Attractiveness Prior Module (PAPM) and a Multi-modal Attractiveness Encoder Module (MAEM), respectively, then integrate the extracted features through a Cross-Modal Fusion Module (CMFM). Extensive experiments conducted on both LiveBeauty and other open-source FAP datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Dataset will be available soon.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been a notable increase in research on machine learning models for music retrieval and generation systems that are capable of taking natural language sentences as inputs. However, there is a scarcity of large-scale publicly available datasets, consisting of music data and their corresponding natural language descriptions known as music captions. In particular, non-musical information such as suitable situations for listening to a track and the emotions elicited upon listening is crucial for describing music. This type of information is underrepresented in existing music caption datasets due to the challenges associated with extracting it directly from music data. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating music caption data that incorporates non-musical aspects inferred from music thumbnail images, and validated the effectiveness of our approach through human evaluations. Additionally, we created a dataset with approximately 360,000 captions containing non-musical aspects. Leveraging this dataset, we trained a music retrieval model and demonstrated its effectiveness in music retrieval tasks through evaluation.

- **Summary**: 3D scene generation conditioned on text prompts has significantly progressed due to the development of 2D diffusion generation models. However, the textual description of 3D scenes is inherently inaccurate and lacks fine-grained control during training, leading to implausible scene generation. As an intuitive and feasible solution, the 3D layout allows for precise specification of object locations within the scene. To this end, we present a text-to-scene generation method (namely, Layout2Scene) using additional semantic layout as the prompt to inject precise control of 3D object positions. Specifically, we first introduce a scene hybrid representation to decouple objects and backgrounds, which is initialized via a pre-trained text-to-3D model. Then, we propose a two-stage scheme to optimize the geometry and appearance of the initialized scene separately. To fully leverage 2D diffusion priors in geometry and appearance generation, we introduce a semantic-guided geometry diffusion model and a semantic-geometry guided diffusion model which are finetuned on a scene dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate more plausible and realistic scenes as compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the generated scene allows for flexible yet precise editing, thereby facilitating multiple downstream applications.

- **Summary**: Facial images have extensive practical applications. Although the current large-scale text-image diffusion models exhibit strong generation capabilities, it is challenging to generate the desired facial images using only text prompt. Image prompts are a logical choice. However, current methods of this type generally focus on general domain. In this paper, we aim to optimize image makeup techniques to generate the desired facial images. Specifically, (1) we built a dataset of 4 million high-quality face image-text pairs (FaceCaptionHQ-4M) based on LAION-Face to train our Face-MakeUp model; (2) to maintain consistency with the reference facial image, we extract/learn multi-scale content features and pose features for the facial image, integrating these into the diffusion model to enhance the preservation of facial identity features for diffusion models. Validation on two face-related test datasets demonstrates that our Face-MakeUp can achieve the best comprehensive performance.All codes are available at:https://github.com/ddw2AIGROUP2CQUPT/Face-MakeUp

- **Summary**: Vision generation remains a challenging frontier in artificial intelligence, requiring seamless integration of visual understanding and generative capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Vision-Driven Prompt Optimization (VDPO), that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically generate textual prompts from visual inputs, guiding high-fidelity image synthesis. VDPO combines a visual embedding prompt tuner, a textual instruction generator, and a vision generation module to achieve state-of-the-art performance in diverse vision generation tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as COCO and Sketchy demonstrate that VDPO consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving significant improvements in FID, LPIPS, and BLEU/CIDEr scores. Additional analyses reveal the scalability, robustness, and generalization capabilities of VDPO, making it a versatile solution for in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Human evaluations further validate the practical superiority of VDPO in generating visually appealing and semantically coherent outputs.



### Pixel-Wise Feature Selection for Perceptual Edge Detection without post-processing

- **Summary**: Although deep convolutional neutral networks (CNNs) have significantly enhanced performance in image edge detection (ED), current models remain highly dependent on post-processing techniques such as non-maximum suppression (NMS), and often fail to deliver satisfactory perceptual results, while the performance will deteriorate significantly if the allowed error toleration distance decreases. These limitations arise from the uniform fusion of features across all pixels, regardless of their specific characteristics, such as the distinction between textural and edge areas. If the features extracted by the ED models are selected more meticulously and encompass greater diversity, the resulting predictions are expected to be more accurate and perceptually meaningful. Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes a novel feature selection paradigm for deep networks that facilitates the differential selection of features and can be seamlessly integrated into existing ED models. By incorporating this additional structure, the performance of conventional ED models is substantially enhanced without post-processing, while simultaneously enhancing the perceptual quality of the predictions. Extensive experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

- **Summary**: Micro-expression recognition (MER) presents a significant challenge due to the transient and subtle nature of the motion changes involved. In recent years, deep learning methods based on attention mechanisms have made some breakthroughs in MER. However, these methods still suffer from the limitations of insufficient feature capture and poor dynamic adaptation when coping with the instantaneous subtle movement changes of micro-expressions. Therefore, in this paper, we design an Adaptive Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention Network (AHMSA-Net) for MER. Specifically, we first utilize the onset and apex frames of the micro-expression sequence to extract three-dimensional (3D) optical flow maps, including horizontal optical flow, vertical optical flow, and optical flow strain. Subsequently, the optical flow feature maps are inputted into AHMSA-Net, which consists of two parts: an adaptive hierarchical framework and a multi-scale attention mechanism. Based on the adaptive downsampling hierarchical attention framework, AHMSA-Net captures the subtle changes of micro-expressions from different granularities (fine and coarse) by dynamically adjusting the size of the optical flow feature map at each layer. Based on the multi-scale attention mechanism, AHMSA-Net learns micro-expression action information by fusing features from different scales (channel and spatial). These two modules work together to comprehensively improve the accuracy of MER. Additionally, rigorous experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive results on major micro-expression databases, with AHMSA-Net achieving recognition accuracy of up to 78.21% on composite databases (SMIC, SAMM, CASMEII) and 77.08% on the CASME^{}3 database.

- **Summary**: Scientific figure captioning is a complex task that requires generating contextually appropriate descriptions of visual content. However, existing methods often fall short by utilizing incomplete information, treating the task solely as either an image-to-text or text summarization problem. This limitation hinders the generation of high-quality captions that fully capture the necessary details. Moreover, existing data sourced from arXiv papers contain low-quality captions, posing significant challenges for training large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a framework called Multi-LLM Collaborative Figure Caption Generation (MLBCAP) to address these challenges by leveraging specialized LLMs for distinct sub-tasks. Our approach unfolds in three key modules: (Quality Assessment) We utilize multimodal LLMs to assess the quality of training data, enabling the filtration of low-quality captions. (Diverse Caption Generation) We then employ a strategy of fine-tuning/prompting multiple LLMs on the captioning task to generate candidate captions. (Judgment) Lastly, we prompt a prominent LLM to select the highest quality caption from the candidates, followed by refining any remaining inaccuracies. Human evaluations demonstrate that informative captions produced by our approach rank better than human-written captions, highlighting its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles have gained significant attention due to technological advancements and their potential to transform transportation. A critical challenge in this domain is precise localization, particularly in LiDAR-based map matching, which is prone to errors due to degeneracy in the data. Most sensor fusion techniques, such as the Kalman filter, rely on accurate error covariance estimates for each sensor to improve localization accuracy. However, obtaining reliable covariance values for map matching remains a complex task. To address this challenge, we propose a neural network-based framework for predicting localization error covariance in LiDAR map matching. To achieve this, we introduce a novel dataset generation method specifically designed for error covariance estimation. In our evaluation using a Kalman filter, we achieved a 2 cm improvement in localization accuracy, a significant enhancement in this domain.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging analysis. Traditional CNN-based methods struggle with modeling long-range dependencies, while Transformer-based models, despite their success, suffer from quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose KM-UNet, a novel U-shaped network architecture that combines the strengths of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and state-space models (SSMs). KM-UNet leverages the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for efficient feature representation and SSMs for scalable long-range modeling, achieving a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. We evaluate KM-UNet on five benchmark datasets: ISIC17, ISIC18, CVC, BUSI, and GLAS. Experimental results demonstrate that KM-UNet achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in medical image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, KM-UNet is the first medical image segmentation framework integrating KANs and SSMs. This work provides a valuable baseline and new insights for the development of more efficient and interpretable medical image segmentation systems.

- **Summary**: Multi-view clustering (MvC) aims to integrate information from different views to enhance the capability of the model in capturing the underlying data structures. The widely used joint training paradigm in MvC is potentially not fully leverage the multi-view information, since the imbalanced and under-optimized view-specific features caused by the uniform learning objective for all views. For instance, particular views with more discriminative information could dominate the learning process in the joint training paradigm, leading to other views being under-optimized. To alleviate this issue, we first analyze the imbalanced phenomenon in the joint-training paradigm of multi-view clustering from the perspective of gradient descent for each view-specific feature extractor. Then, we propose a novel balanced multi-view clustering (BMvC) method, which introduces a view-specific contrastive regularization (VCR) to modulate the optimization of each view. Concretely, VCR preserves the sample similarities captured from the joint features and view-specific ones into the clustering distributions corresponding to view-specific features to enhance the learning process of view-specific feature extractors. Additionally, a theoretical analysis is provided to illustrate that VCR adaptively modulates the magnitudes of gradients for updating the parameters of view-specific feature extractors to achieve a balanced multi-view learning procedure. In such a manner, BMvC achieves a better trade-off between the exploitation of view-specific patterns and the exploration of view-invariance patterns to fully learn the multi-view information for the clustering task. Finally, a set of experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art approaches both on eight benchmark MvC datasets and two spatially resolved transcriptomics datasets.

- **Summary**: With the advancements in Large Language and Latent Diffusion models, brain decoding has achieved remarkable results in recent years. The works on the NSD dataset, with stimuli images from the COCO dataset, leverage the embeddings from the CLIP model for image reconstruction and GIT for captioning. However, the current captioning approach introduces the challenge of potential data contamination given that the GIT model was trained on the COCO dataset. In this work, we present an alternative method for decoding brain signals into image captions by predicting a DINOv2 model's embedding of an image from the corresponding fMRI signal and then providing its [CLS] token as the prefix to the GPT-2 language model which decreases computational requirements considerably. Additionally, instead of commonly used Linear Regression, we explore 3D Convolutional Neural Network mapping of fMRI signals to image embedding space for better accounting positional information of voxels.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation within the diffusion-denoising paradigm demonstrates impressive generalization ability but suffers from low inference speed. Recent methods adopt a single-step deterministic paradigm to improve inference efficiency while maintaining comparable performance. However, they overlook the gap between generative and discriminative features, leading to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose DepthMaster, a single-step diffusion model designed to adapt generative features for the discriminative depth estimation task. First, to mitigate overfitting to texture details introduced by generative features, we propose a Feature Alignment module, which incorporates high-quality semantic features to enhance the denoising network's representation capability. Second, to address the lack of fine-grained details in the single-step deterministic framework, we propose a Fourier Enhancement module to adaptively balance low-frequency structure and high-frequency details. We adopt a two-stage training strategy to fully leverage the potential of the two modules. In the first stage, we focus on learning the global scene structure with the Feature Alignment module, while in the second stage, we exploit the Fourier Enhancement module to improve the visual quality. Through these efforts, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of generalization and detail preservation, outperforming other diffusion-based methods across various datasets.

- **Summary**: Atypical gaze behavior is a diagnostic hallmark of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), playing a substantial role in the social and communicative challenges that individuals with ASD face. This study explores the impacts of a month-long, in-home intervention designed to promote triadic interactions between a social robot, a child with ASD, and their caregiver. Our results indicate that the intervention successfully promoted appropriate gaze behavior, encouraging children with ASD to follow the robot's gaze, resulting in more frequent and prolonged instances of spontaneous eye contact and joint attention with their caregivers. Additionally, we observed specific timelines for behavioral variability and novelty effects among users. Furthermore, diagnostic measures for ASD emerged as strong predictors of gaze patterns for both caregivers and children. These results deepen our understanding of ASD gaze patterns and highlight the potential for clinical relevance of robot-assisted interventions.

- **Summary**: Skeleton-based action recognition has gained significant attention for its ability to efficiently represent spatiotemporal information in a lightweight format. Most existing approaches use graph-based models to process skeleton sequences, where each pose is represented as a skeletal graph structured around human physical connectivity. Among these, the Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) has become a widely used framework. Alternatively, hypergraph-based models, such as the Hyperformer, capture higher-order correlations, offering a more expressive representation of complex joint interactions. A recent advancement, termed Taylor Videos, introduces motion-enhanced skeleton sequences by embedding motion concepts, providing a fresh perspective on interpreting human actions in skeleton-based action recognition. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both traditional skeleton sequences and Taylor-transformed skeletons using ST-GCN and Hyperformer models on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets. We compare skeletal graph and hypergraph representations, analyzing static poses against motion-injected poses. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of Taylor-transformed skeletons, demonstrating their potential to enhance motion dynamics while exposing current challenges in fully using their benefits. This study underscores the need for innovative skeletal modelling techniques to effectively handle motion-rich data and advance the field of action recognition.

- **Summary**: Medical imaging is crucial for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating medical conditions. The medical reports of radiology images are the primary medium through which medical professionals attest their findings, but their writing is time consuming and requires specialized clinical expertise. The automated generation of radiography reports has thus the potential to improve and standardize patient care and significantly reduce clinicians workload. Through our work, we have designed and evaluated an end-to-end transformer-based method to generate accurate and factually complete radiology reports for X-ray images. Additionally, we are the first to introduce curriculum learning for end-to-end transformers in medical imaging and demonstrate its impact in obtaining improved performance. The experiments have been conducted using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG database, the largest available chest X-ray dataset. The results obtained are comparable with the current state-of-the-art on the natural language generation (NLG) metrics BLEU and ROUGE-L, while setting new state-of-the-art results on F1 examples-averaged, F1-macro and F1-micro metrics for clinical accuracy and on the METEOR metric widely used for NLG.

- **Summary**: Existing methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection use various techniques to produce a score, separate from classification, that determines how ``OOD'' an input is. Our insight is that OOD detection can be simplified by using a neural network architecture which can effectively merge classification and OOD detection into a single step. Radial basis function networks (RBFNs) inherently link classification confidence and OOD detection; however, these networks have lost popularity due to the difficult of training them in a multi-layer fashion. In this work, we develop a multi-layer radial basis function network (MLRBFN) which can be easily trained. To ensure that these networks are also effective for OOD detection, we develop a novel depression mechanism. We apply MLRBFNs as standalone classifiers and as heads on top of pretrained feature extractors, and find that they are competitive with commonly used methods for OOD detection. Our MLRBFN architecture demonstrates a promising new direction for OOD detection methods.

- **Summary**: Instructional cataract surgery videos are crucial for ophthalmologists and trainees to observe surgical details repeatedly. This paper presents a deep learning model for real-time identification of surgical instruments in these videos, using a custom dataset scraped from open-access sources. Inspired by the architecture of YOLOV9, the model employs a Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) mechanism and a novel Generally-Optimized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (Go-ELAN) to address the information bottleneck problem, enhancing Minimum Average Precision (mAP) at higher Non-Maximum Suppression Intersection over Union (NMS IoU) scores. The Go-ELAN YOLOV9 model, evaluated against YOLO v5, v7, v8, v9 vanilla, Laptool and DETR, achieves a superior mAP of 73.74 at IoU 0.5 on a dataset of 615 images with 10 instrument classes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.

- **Summary**: Although existing Sparsely Annotated Object Detection (SAOD) approches have made progress in handling sparsely annotated environments in multispectral domain, where only some pedestrians are annotated, they still have the following limitations: (i) they lack considerations for improving the quality of pseudo-labels for missing annotations, and (ii) they rely on fixed ground truth annotations, which leads to learning only a limited range of pedestrian visual appearances in the multispectral domain. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Sparsely Annotated Multispectral Pedestrian Detection (SAMPD). For limitation (i), we introduce Multispectral Pedestrian-aware Adaptive Weight (MPAW) and Positive Pseudo-label Enhancement (PPE) module. Utilizing multispectral knowledge, these modules ensure the generation of high-quality pseudo-labels and enable effective learning by increasing weights for high-quality pseudo-labels based on modality characteristics. To address limitation (ii), we propose an Adaptive Pedestrian Retrieval Augmentation (APRA) module, which adaptively incorporates pedestrian patches from ground-truth and dynamically integrates high-quality pseudo-labels with the ground-truth, facilitating a more diverse learning pool of pedestrians. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our SAMPD significantly enhances performance in sparsely annotated environments within the multispectral domain.

- **Summary**: Predicting plant species composition in specific spatiotemporal contexts plays an important role in biodiversity management and conservation, as well as in improving species identification tools. Our work utilizes 88,987 plant survey records conducted in specific spatiotemporal contexts across Europe. We also use the corresponding satellite images, time series data, climate time series, and other rasterized environmental data such as land cover, human footprint, bioclimatic, and soil variables as training data to train the model to predict the outcomes of 4,716 plant surveys. We propose a feature construction and result correction method based on the graph structure. Through comparative experiments, we select the best-performing backbone networks for feature extraction in both temporal and image modalities. In this process, we built a backbone network based on the Swin-Transformer Block for extracting temporal Cubes features. We then design a hierarchical cross-attention mechanism capable of robustly fusing features from multiple modalities. During training, we adopt a 10-fold cross-fusion method based on fine-tuning and use a Threshold Top-K method for post-processing. Ablation experiments demonstrate the improvements in model performance brought by our proposed solution pipeline.



### Generalizing from SIMPLE to HARD Visual Reasoning: Can We Mitigate Modality Imbalance in VLMs?

- **Summary**: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) are impressive in tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning, their ability to apply multi-step reasoning to images has lagged, giving rise to perceptions of modality imbalance or brittleness. Towards systematic study of such issues, we introduce a synthetic framework for assessing the ability of VLMs to perform algorithmic visual reasoning (AVR), comprising three tasks: Table Readout, Grid Navigation, and Visual Analogy. Each has two levels of difficulty, SIMPLE and HARD, and even the SIMPLE versions are difficult for frontier VLMs. We seek strategies for training on the SIMPLE version of the tasks that improve performance on the corresponding HARD task, i.e., S2H generalization. This synthetic framework, where each task also has a text-only version, allows a quantification of the modality imbalance, and how it is impacted by training strategy. Ablations highlight the importance of explicit image-to-text conversion in promoting S2H generalization when using auto-regressive training. We also report results of mechanistic study of this phenomenon, including a measure of gradient alignment that seems to identify training strategies that promote better S2H generalization.

- **Summary**: 4D video control is essential in video generation as it enables the use of sophisticated lens techniques, such as multi-camera shooting and dolly zoom, which are currently unsupported by existing methods. Training a video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly to control 4D content requires expensive multi-view videos. Inspired by Monocular Dynamic novel View Synthesis (MDVS) that optimizes a 4D representation and renders videos according to different 4D elements, such as camera pose and object motion editing, we bring pseudo 4D Gaussian fields to video generation. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that constructs a pseudo 4D Gaussian field with dense 3D point tracking and renders the Gaussian field for all video frames. Then we finetune a pretrained DiT to generate videos following the guidance of the rendered video, dubbed as GS-DiT. To boost the training of the GS-DiT, we also propose an efficient Dense 3D Point Tracking (D3D-PT) method for the pseudo 4D Gaussian field construction. Our D3D-PT outperforms SpatialTracker, the state-of-the-art sparse 3D point tracking method, in accuracy and accelerates the inference speed by two orders of magnitude. During the inference stage, GS-DiT can generate videos with the same dynamic content while adhering to different camera parameters, addressing a significant limitation of current video generation models. GS-DiT demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and extends the 4D controllability of Gaussian splatting to video generation beyond just camera poses. It supports advanced cinematic effects through the manipulation of the Gaussian field and camera intrinsics, making it a powerful tool for creative video production.
