- **Summary**: Managing the massive annual gatherings of Hajj and Umrah presents significant challenges, particularly as the Saudi government aims to increase the number of pilgrims. Currently, around two million pilgrims attend Hajj and 26 million attend Umrah making crowd control especially in critical areas like the Grand Mosque during Tawaf, a major concern. Additional risks arise in managing dense crowds at key sites such as Arafat where the potential for stampedes, fires and pandemics poses serious threats to public safety. This research proposes a machine learning model to classify crowd density into three levels: moderate crowd, overcrowded and very dense crowd in video frames recorded during Hajj, with a flashing red light to alert organizers in real-time when a very dense crowd is detected. While current research efforts in processing Hajj surveillance videos focus solely on using CNN to detect abnormal behaviors, this research focuses more on high-risk crowds that can lead to disasters. Hazardous crowd conditions require a robust method, as incorrect classification could trigger unnecessary alerts and government intervention, while failure to classify could result in disaster. The proposed model integrates Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture analysis, which enhances feature extraction for differentiating crowd density levels, along with edge density and area-based features. The model was tested on the KAU-Smart Crowd 'HAJJv2' dataset which contains 18 videos from various key locations during Hajj including 'Massaa', 'Jamarat', 'Arafat' and 'Tawaf'. The model achieved an accuracy rate of 87% with a 2.14% error percentage (misclassification rate), demonstrating its ability to detect and classify various crowd conditions effectively. That contributes to enhanced crowd management and safety during large-scale events like Hajj.

- **Summary**: Designing a dental crown is a time-consuming and labor intensive process. Our goal is to simplify crown design and minimize the tediousness of making manual adjustments while still ensuring the highest level of accuracy and consistency. To this end, we present a new end- to-end deep learning approach, coined Dental Mesh Completion (DMC), to generate a crown mesh conditioned on a point cloud context. The dental context includes the tooth prepared to receive a crown and its surroundings, namely the two adjacent teeth and the three closest teeth in the opposing jaw. We formulate crown generation in terms of completing this point cloud context. A feature extractor first converts the input point cloud into a set of feature vectors that represent local regions in the point cloud. The set of feature vectors is then fed into a transformer to predict a new set of feature vectors for the missing region (crown). Subsequently, a point reconstruction head, followed by a multi-layer perceptron, is used to predict a dense set of points with normals. Finally, a differentiable point-to-mesh layer serves to reconstruct the crown surface mesh. We compare our DMC method to a graph-based convolutional neural network which learns to deform a crown mesh from a generic crown shape to the target geometry. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which attains an average of 0.062 Chamfer Distance.The code is available at:https://github.com/Golriz-code/DMC.gi

- **Summary**: Computer-aided design (CAD) tools empower designers to design and modify 3D models through a series of CAD operations, commonly referred to as a CAD sequence. In scenarios where digital CAD files are not accessible, reverse engineering (RE) has been used to reconstruct 3D CAD models. Recent advances have seen the rise of data-driven approaches for RE, with a primary focus on converting 3D data, such as point clouds, into 3D models in boundary representation (B-rep) format. However, obtaining 3D data poses significant challenges, and B-rep models do not reveal knowledge about the 3D modeling process of designs. To this end, our research introduces a novel data-driven approach with an Image2CADSeq neural network model. This model aims to reverse engineer CAD models by processing images as input and generating CAD sequences. These sequences can then be translated into B-rep models using a solid modeling kernel. Unlike B-rep models, CAD sequences offer enhanced flexibility to modify individual steps of model creation, providing a deeper understanding of the construction process of CAD models. To quantitatively and rigorously evaluate the predictive performance of the Image2CADSeq model, we have developed a multi-level evaluation framework for model assessment. The model was trained on a specially synthesized dataset, and various network architectures were explored to optimize the performance. The experimental and validation results show great potential for the model in generating CAD sequences from 2D image data.

- **Summary**: Existing Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) methods often encounter the problem of "instance lumping" under scene-level supervision, particularly in scenarios with a dense distribution of changed instances (i.e., changed objects). In these scenarios, unchanged pixels between changed instances are also mistakenly identified as changed, causing multiple changes to be mistakenly viewed as one. In practical applications, this issue prevents the accurate quantification of the number of changes. To address this issue, we propose a Dense Instance Separation (DISep) method as a plug-and-play solution, refining pixel features from a unified instance perspective under scene-level supervision. Specifically, our DISep comprises a three-step iterative training process: 1) Instance Localization: We locate instance candidate regions for changed pixels using high-pass class activation maps. 2) Instance Retrieval: We identify and group these changed pixels into different instance IDs through connectivity searching. Then, based on the assigned instance IDs, we extract corresponding pixel-level features on a per-instance basis. 3) Instance Separation: We introduce a separation loss to enforce intra-instance pixel consistency in the embedding space, thereby ensuring separable instance feature representations. The proposed DISep adds only minimal training cost and no inference cost. It can be seamlessly integrated to enhance existing WSCD methods. We achieve state-of-the-art performance by enhancing {three Transformer-based and four ConvNet-based methods} on the LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, DSIFN-CD, SYSU-CD, and CDD datasets. Additionally, our DISep can be used to improve fully-supervised change detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/zhenghuizhao/Plug-and-Play-DISep-for-Change-Detection.

- **Summary**: Referring video object segmentation aims to segment objects within a video corresponding to a given text description. Existing transformer-based temporal modeling approaches face challenges related to query inconsistency and the limited consideration of context. Query inconsistency produces unstable masks of different objects in the middle of the video. The limited consideration of context leads to the segmentation of incorrect objects by failing to adequately account for the relationship between the given text and instances. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-context Temporal Consistency Module (MTCM), which consists of an Aligner and a Multi-Context Enhancer (MCE). The Aligner removes noise from queries and aligns them to achieve query consistency. The MCE predicts text-relevant queries by considering multi-context. We applied MTCM to four different models, increasing performance across all of them, particularly achieving 47.6 J&F on the MeViS. Code is available at https://github.com/Choi58/MTCM.



### MambaHSI: Spatial-Spectral Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification

- **Summary**: Transformer has been extensively explored for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, transformer poses challenges in terms of speed and memory usage because of its quadratic computational complexity. Recently, the Mamba model has emerged as a promising approach, which has strong long-distance modeling capabilities while maintaining a linear computational complexity. However, representing the HSI is challenging for the Mamba due to the requirement for an integrated spatial and spectral understanding. To remedy these drawbacks, we propose a novel HSI classification model based on a Mamba model, named MambaHSI, which can simultaneously model long-range interaction of the whole image and integrate spatial and spectral information in an adaptive manner. Specifically, we design a spatial Mamba block (SpaMB) to model the long-range interaction of the whole image at the pixel-level. Then, we propose a spectral Mamba block (SpeMB) to split the spectral vector into multiple groups, mine the relations across different spectral groups, and extract spectral features. Finally, we propose a spatial-spectral fusion module (SSFM) to adaptively integrate spatial and spectral features of a HSI. To our best knowledge, this is the first image-level HSI classification model based on the Mamba. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse HSI datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model for HSI classification. This reveals the great potential of Mamba to be the next-generation backbone for HSI models.

- **Summary**: In assistive robotics serving people with disabilities (PWD), accurate place recognition in built environments is crucial to ensure that robots navigate and interact safely within diverse indoor spaces. Language interfaces, particularly those powered by Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision Language Models (VLM), hold significant promise in this context, as they can interpret visual scenes and correlate them with semantic information. However, such interfaces are also known for their hallucinated predictions. In addition, language instructions provided by humans can also be ambiguous and lack precise details about specific locations, objects, or actions, exacerbating the hallucination issue. In this work, we introduce Seeing with Partial Certainty (SwPC) - a framework designed to measure and align uncertainty in VLM-based place recognition, enabling the model to recognize when it lacks confidence and seek assistance when necessary. This framework is built on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on place recognition while minimizing requests for human help in complex indoor environment settings. Through experiments on the widely used richly-annotated scene dataset Matterport3D, we show that SwPC significantly increases the success rate and decreases the amount of human intervention required relative to the prior art. SwPC can be utilized with any VLMs directly without requiring model fine-tuning, offering a promising, lightweight approach to uncertainty modeling that complements and scales alongside the expanding capabilities of foundational models.

- **Summary**: Deep neural network (DNN) based perception models are indispensable in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, their reliance on large-scale, high-quality data is broadly recognized as a burdensome necessity due to the substantial cost of data acquisition and labeling. Further, the issue is not a one-time concern, as AVs might need a new dataset if they are to be deployed to another region (real-target domain) that the in-hand dataset within the real-source domain cannot incorporate. To mitigate this burden, we propose leveraging synthetic environments as an auxiliary domain where the characteristics of real domains are reproduced. This approach could enable indirect experience about the real-target domain in a time- and cost-effective manner. As a practical demonstration of our methodology, nuScenes and South Korea are employed to represent real-source and real-target domains, respectively. That means we construct digital twins for several regions of South Korea, and the data-acquisition framework of nuScenes is reproduced. Blending the aforementioned components within a simulator allows us to obtain a synthetic-fusion domain in which we forge our novel driving dataset, MORDA: Mixture Of Real-domain characteristics for synthetic-data-assisted Domain Adaptation. To verify the value of synthetic features that MORDA provides in learning about driving environments of South Korea, 2D/3D detectors are trained solely on a combination of nuScenes and MORDA. Afterward, their performance is evaluated on the unforeseen real-world dataset (AI-Hub) collected in South Korea. Our experiments present that MORDA can significantly improve mean Average Precision (mAP) on AI-Hub dataset while that on nuScenes is retained or slightly enhanced.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models in medical imaging face dual challenges: domain shift, where models perform poorly when deployed in settings different from their training environment, and class imbalance, where certain disease conditions are naturally underrepresented. We present Imbalance-Aware Domain Adaptation (IADA), a novel framework that simultaneously tackles both challenges through three key components: (1) adaptive feature learning with class-specific attention mechanisms, (2) balanced domain alignment with dynamic weighting, and (3) adaptive threshold optimization. Our theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees and complexity bounds. Through extensive experiments on embryo development assessment across four imaging modalities, IADA demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods, achieving up to 25.19\% higher accuracy while maintaining balanced performance across classes. In challenging scenarios with low-quality imaging systems, IADA shows robust generalization with AUC improvements of up to 12.56\%. These results demonstrate IADA's potential for developing reliable and equitable medical imaging systems for diverse clinical settings.

- **Summary**: From Paleolithic cave paintings to Impressionism, human painting has evolved to depict increasingly complex and detailed scenes, conveying more nuanced messages. This paper attempts to emerge this artistic capability by simulating the evolutionary pressures that enhance visual communication efficiency. Specifically, we present a model with a stroke branch and a palette branch that together simulate human-like painting. The palette branch learns a limited colour palette, while the stroke branch parameterises each stroke using B\'ezier curves to render an image, subsequently evaluated by a high-level recognition module. We quantify the efficiency of visual communication by measuring the recognition accuracy achieved with machine vision. The model then optimises the control points and colour choices for each stroke to maximise recognition accuracy with minimal strokes and colours. Experimental results show that our model achieves superior performance in high-level recognition tasks, delivering artistic expression and aesthetic appeal, especially in abstract sketches. Additionally, our approach shows promise as an efficient bit-level image compression technique, outperforming traditional methods.

- **Summary**: As opposed to human drivers, current autonomous driving systems still require vast amounts of labeled data to train. Recently, world models have been proposed to simultaneously enhance autonomous driving capabilities by improving the way these systems understand complex real-world environments and reduce their data demands via self-supervised pre-training. In this paper, we present AD-L-JEPA (aka Autonomous Driving with LiDAR data via a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture), a novel self-supervised pre-training framework for autonomous driving with LiDAR data that, as opposed to existing methods, is neither generative nor contrastive. Our method learns spatial world models with a joint embedding predictive architecture. Instead of explicitly generating masked unknown regions, our self-supervised world models predict Bird's Eye View (BEV) embeddings to represent the diverse nature of autonomous driving scenes. Our approach furthermore eliminates the need to manually create positive and negative pairs, as is the case in contrastive learning. AD-L-JEPA leads to simpler implementation and enhanced learned representations. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate high-quality of embeddings learned with AD-L-JEPA. We furthermore evaluate the accuracy and label efficiency of AD-L-JEPA on popular downstream tasks such as LiDAR 3D object detection and associated transfer learning. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that AD-L-JEPA is a plausible approach for self-supervised pre-training in autonomous driving applications and is the best available approach outperforming SOTA, including most recently proposed Occupancy-MAE [1] and ALSO [2].

- **Summary**: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) offer inherent interpretability by initially translating images into human-comprehensible concepts, followed by a linear combination of these concepts for classification. However, the annotation of concepts for visual recognition tasks requires extensive expert knowledge and labor, constraining the broad adoption of CBMs. Recent approaches have leveraged the knowledge of large language models to construct concept bottlenecks, with multimodal models like CLIP subsequently mapping image features into the concept feature space for classification. Despite this, the concepts produced by language models can be verbose and may introduce non-visual attributes, which hurts accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we investigate to avoid these issues by constructing CBMs directly from multimodal models. To this end, we adopt common words as base concept vocabulary and leverage auxiliary unlabeled images to construct a Vision-to-Concept (V2C) tokenizer that can explicitly quantize images into their most relevant visual concepts, thus creating a vision-oriented concept bottleneck tightly coupled with the multimodal model. This leads to our V2C-CBM which is training efficient and interpretable with high accuracy. Our V2C-CBM has matched or outperformed LLM-supervised CBMs on various visual classification benchmarks, validating the efficacy of our approach.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES) aims to segment point cloud scenes based on a given expression. However, existing 3D-RES approaches face two major challenges: feature ambiguity and intent ambiguity. Feature ambiguity arises from information loss or distortion during point cloud acquisition due to limitations such as lighting and viewpoint. Intent ambiguity refers to the model's equal treatment of all queries during the decoding process, lacking top-down task-specific guidance. In this paper, we introduce an Image enhanced Prompt Decoding Network (IPDN), which leverages multi-view images and task-driven information to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. To address feature ambiguity, we propose the Multi-view Semantic Embedding (MSE) module, which injects multi-view 2D image information into the 3D scene and compensates for potential spatial information loss. To tackle intent ambiguity, we designed a Prompt-Aware Decoder (PAD) that guides the decoding process by deriving task-driven signals from the interaction between the expression and visual features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that IPDN outperforms the state-ofthe-art by 1.9 and 4.2 points in mIoU metrics on the 3D-RES and 3D-GRES tasks, respectively.

- **Summary**: In the medical field, accurate diagnosis of lung cancer is crucial for treatment. Traditional manual analysis methods have significant limitations in terms of accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep learning network framework based on the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model, initialized with weights from the ImageNet-1K dataset (version 2). The last layer of the model (the fully connected layer) is replaced with a new fully connected layer, and a softmax activation function is added to efficiently classify three types of lung cancer CT scan images. Experimental results show that the model achieves an accuracy of 99.6% on the test set, with significant improvements in feature extraction compared to traditional models.With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies, deep learning applications in medical image processing are bringing revolutionary changes to the healthcare industry. AI-based lung cancer detection systems can significantly improve diagnostic efficiency, reduce the workload of doctors, and occupy an important position in the global healthcare market. The potential of AI to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce medical costs, and promote precision medicine will have a profound impact on the future development of the healthcare industry.

- **Summary**: Oceanographers rely on visual analysis to interpret model simulations, identify events and phenomena, and track dynamic ocean processes. The ever increasing resolution and complexity of ocean data due to its dynamic nature and multivariate relationships demands a scalable and adaptable visualization tool for interactive exploration. We introduce pyParaOcean, a scalable and interactive visualization system designed specifically for ocean data analysis. pyParaOcean offers specialized modules for common oceanographic analysis tasks, including eddy identification and salinity movement tracking. These modules seamlessly integrate with ParaView as filters, ensuring a user-friendly and easy-to-use system while leveraging the parallelization capabilities of ParaView and a plethora of inbuilt general-purpose visualization functionalities. The creation of an auxiliary dataset stored as a Cinema database helps address I/O and network bandwidth bottlenecks while supporting the generation of quick overview visualizations. We present a case study on the Bay of Bengal (BoB) to demonstrate the utility of the system and scaling studies to evaluate the efficiency of the system.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) involves learning new classes from limited data while retaining prior knowledge, and often results in catastrophic forgetting. Existing methods either freeze backbone networks to preserve knowledge, which limits adaptability, or rely on additional modules or prompts, introducing inference overhead. To this end, we propose Continuous Knowledge-Preserving Decomposition for FSCIL (CKPD-FSCIL), a framework that decomposes a model's weights into two parts: one that compacts existing knowledge (knowledge-sensitive components) and another that carries redundant capacity to accommodate new abilities (redundant-capacity components). The decomposition is guided by a covariance matrix from replay samples, ensuring principal components align with classification abilities. During adaptation, we freeze the knowledge-sensitive components and only adapt the redundant-capacity components, fostering plasticity while minimizing interference without changing the architecture or increasing overhead. Additionally, CKPD introduces an adaptive layer selection strategy to identify layers with redundant capacity, dynamically allocating adapters.

- **Summary**: Motion-controllable image animation is a fundamental task with a wide range of potential applications. Recent works have made progress in controlling camera or object motion via various motion representations, while they still struggle to support collaborative camera and object motion control with adaptive control granularity. To this end, we introduce 3D-aware motion representation and propose an image animation framework, called Perception-as-Control, to achieve fine-grained collaborative motion control. Specifically, we construct 3D-aware motion representation from a reference image, manipulate it based on interpreted user intentions, and perceive it from different viewpoints. In this way, camera and object motions are transformed into intuitive, consistent visual changes. Then, the proposed framework leverages the perception results as motion control signals, enabling it to support various motion-related video synthesis tasks in a unified and flexible way. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: The enhancement of generalization in robots by large vision-language models (LVLMs) is increasingly evident. Therefore, the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs based on egocentric videos are of great interest. However, current datasets for embodied video question answering lack comprehensive and systematic evaluation frameworks. Critical embodied cognitive issues, such as robotic self-cognition, dynamic scene perception, and hallucination, are rarely addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose ECBench, a high-quality benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs. ECBench features a diverse range of scene video sources, open and varied question formats, and 30 dimensions of embodied cognition. To ensure quality, balance, and high visual dependence, ECBench uses class-independent meticulous human annotation and multi-round question screening strategies. Additionally, we introduce ECEval, a comprehensive evaluation system that ensures the fairness and rationality of the indicators. Utilizing ECBench, we conduct extensive evaluations of proprietary, open-source, and task-specific LVLMs. ECBench is pivotal in advancing the embodied cognitive capabilities of LVLMs, laying a solid foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied agents.

- **Summary**: Fingerprint mosaicking, which is the process of combining multiple fingerprint images into a single master fingerprint, is an essential process in modern biometric systems. However, it is prone to errors that can significantly degrade fingerprint image quality. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to detect and score mosaicking artifacts in fingerprint images. Our method leverages a self-supervised learning framework to train a model on large-scale unlabeled fingerprint data, eliminating the need for manual artifact annotation. The proposed model effectively identifies mosaicking errors, achieving high accuracy on various fingerprint modalities, including contactless, rolled, and pressed fingerprints and furthermore proves to be robust to different data sources. Additionally, we introduce a novel mosaicking artifact score to quantify the severity of errors, enabling automated evaluation of fingerprint images. By addressing the challenges of mosaicking artifact detection, our work contributes to improving the accuracy and reliability of fingerprint-based biometric systems.

- **Summary**: This paper introduce LongViTU, a large-scale (~121k QA pairs, ~900h videos), automatically generated dataset for long-form video understanding. We developed a systematic approach that organizes videos into a hierarchical tree structure and incorporates self-revision mechanisms to ensure high-quality QA pairs. Each QA pair in LongViTU features: 1) long-term context (average certificate length of 4.6 minutes); 2) rich knowledge and condensed reasoning (commonsense, causality, planning, etc.); and 3) explicit timestamp labels for relevant events. LongViTU also serves as a benchmark for instruction following in long-form and streaming video understanding. We evaluate the open-source state-of-the-art long video understanding model, LongVU, and the commercial model, Gemini-1.5-Pro, on our benchmark. They achieve GPT-4 scores of 49.9 and 52.3, respectively, underscoring the substantial challenge posed by our benchmark. Further supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on LongVU led to performance improvements of 12.0% on our benchmark, 2.2% on the in-distribution (ID) benchmark EgoSchema, 1.0%, 2.2% and 1.2% on the out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks VideoMME (Long), WorldQA and OpenEQA, respectively. These outcomes demonstrate LongViTU's high data quality and robust OOD generalizability.

- **Summary**: Human skeleton information is important in skeleton-based action recognition, which provides a simple and efficient way to describe human pose. However, existing skeleton-based methods focus more on the skeleton, ignoring the objects interacting with humans, resulting in poor performance in recognizing actions that involve object interactions. We propose a new action recognition framework introducing object nodes to supplement absent interactive object information. We also propose Spatial Temporal Variable Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-VGCN) to effectively model the Variable Graph (VG) containing object nodes. Specifically, in order to validate the role of interactive object information, by leveraging a simple self-training approach, we establish a new dataset, JXGC 24, and an extended dataset, NTU RGB+D+Object 60, including more than 2 million additional object nodes. At the same time, we designe the Variable Graph construction method to accommodate a variable number of nodes for graph structure. Additionally, we are the first to explore the overfitting issue introduced by incorporating additional object information, and we propose a VG-based data augmentation method to address this issue, called Random Node Attack. Finally, regarding the network structure, we introduce two fusion modules, CAF and WNPool, along with a novel Node Balance Loss, to enhance the comprehensive performance by effectively fusing and balancing skeleton and object node information. Our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on multiple skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks. The accuracy of our method on NTU RGB+D 60 cross-subject split is 96.7\%, and on cross-view split, it is 99.2\%.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Octopus, a novel video multimodal large language model. LLaVA-Octopus adaptively weights features from different visual projectors based on user instructions, enabling us to leverage the complementary strengths of each projector. We observe that different visual projectors exhibit distinct characteristics when handling specific tasks. For instance, some projectors excel at capturing static details, while others are more effective at processing temporal information, and some are better suited for tasks requiring temporal coherence. By dynamically adjusting feature weights according to user instructions, LLaVA-Octopus dynamically selects and combines the most suitable features, significantly enhancing the model's performance in multimodal tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-Octopus achieves excellent performance across multiple benchmarks, especially in tasks such as multimodal understanding, visual question answering, and video understanding, highlighting its broad application potential.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes the first video-grounded entailment tree reasoning method for commonsense video question answering (VQA). Despite the remarkable progress of large visual-language models (VLMs), there are growing concerns that they learn spurious correlations between videos and likely answers, reinforced by their black-box nature and remaining benchmarking biases. Our method explicitly grounds VQA tasks to video fragments in four steps: entailment tree construction, video-language entailment verification, tree reasoning, and dynamic tree expansion. A vital benefit of the method is its generalizability to current video and image-based VLMs across reasoning types. To support fair evaluation, we devise a de-biasing procedure based on large-language models that rewrites VQA benchmark answer sets to enforce model reasoning. Systematic experiments on existing and de-biased benchmarks highlight the impact of our method components across benchmarks, VLMs, and reasoning types.

- **Summary**: Video moment search, the process of finding relevant moments in a video corpus to match a user's query, is crucial for various applications. Existing solutions, however, often assume a single perfect matching moment, struggle with inefficient inference, and have limitations with hour-long videos. This paper introduces a flexible and scalable framework for retrieving a ranked list of moments from collection of videos in any length to match a text query, a task termed Ranked Video Moment Retrieval (RVMR). Our framework, called Segment-Proposal-Ranking (SPR), simplifies the search process into three independent stages: segment retrieval, proposal generation, and moment refinement with re-ranking. Specifically, videos are divided into equal-length segments with precomputed embeddings indexed offline, allowing efficient retrieval regardless of video length. For scalable online retrieval, both segments and queries are projected into a shared feature space to enable approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. Retrieved segments are then merged into coarse-grained moment proposals. Then a refinement and re-ranking module is designed to reorder and adjust timestamps of the coarse-grained proposals. Evaluations on the TVR-Ranking dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant reductions in computational cost and processing time. The flexible design also allows for independent improvements to each stage, making SPR highly adaptable for large-scale applications.

- **Summary**: Contactless fingerprint recognition systems offer a hygienic, user-friendly, and efficient alternative to traditional contact-based methods. However, their accuracy heavily relies on precise fingertip detection and segmentation, particularly under challenging background conditions. This paper introduces TipSegNet, a novel deep learning model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in segmenting fingertips directly from grayscale hand images. TipSegNet leverages a ResNeXt-101 backbone for robust feature extraction, combined with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale representation, enabling accurate segmentation across varying finger poses and image qualities. Furthermore, we employ an extensive data augmentation strategy to enhance the model's generalizability and robustness. TipSegNet outperforms existing methods, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.987 and an accuracy of 0.999, representing a significant advancement in contactless fingerprint segmentation. This enhanced accuracy has the potential to substantially improve the reliability and effectiveness of contactless biometric systems in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Objective: There exist several X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning strategies to reduce a radiation dose, such as (1) sparse-view CT, (2) low-dose CT, and (3) region-of-interest (ROI) CT (called interior tomography). To further reduce the dose, the sparse-view and/or low-dose CT settings can be applied together with interior tomography. Interior tomography has various advantages in terms of reducing the number of detectors and decreasing the X-ray radiation dose. However, a large patient or small field-of-view (FOV) detector can cause truncated projections, and then the reconstructed images suffer from severe cupping artifacts. In addition, although the low-dose CT can reduce the radiation exposure dose, analytic reconstruction algorithms produce image noise. Recently, many researchers have utilized image-domain deep learning (DL) approaches to remove each artifact and demonstrated impressive performances, and the theory of deep convolutional framelets supports the reason for the performance improvement. Approach: In this paper, we found that the image-domain convolutional neural network (CNN) is difficult to solve coupled artifacts, based on deep convolutional framelets. Significance: To address the coupled problem, we decouple it into two sub-problems: (i) image domain noise reduction inside truncated projection to solve low-dose CT problem and (ii) extrapolation of projection outside truncated projection to solve the ROI CT problem. The decoupled sub-problems are solved directly with a novel proposed end-to-end learning using dual-domain CNNs. Main results: We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional image-domain deep learning methods, and a projection-domain CNN shows better performance than the image-domain CNNs which are commonly used by many researchers.

- **Summary**: The implementation of diffusion-based pansharpening task is predominantly constrained by its slow inference speed, which results from numerous sampling steps. Despite the existing techniques aiming to accelerate sampling, they often compromise performance when fusing multi-source images. To ease this limitation, we introduce a novel and efficient diffusion model named Diffusion Model for Pansharpening by Inferring Residual Inference (ResPanDiff), which significantly reduces the number of diffusion steps without sacrificing the performance to tackle pansharpening task. In ResPanDiff, we innovatively propose a Markov chain that transits from noisy residuals to the residuals between the LRMS and HRMS images, thereby reducing the number of sampling steps and enhancing performance. Additionally, we design the latent space to help model extract more features at the encoding stage, Shallow Cond-Injection~(SC-I) to help model fetch cond-injected hidden features with higher dimensions, and loss functions to give a better guidance for the residual generation task. enabling the model to achieve superior performance in residual generation. Furthermore, experimental evaluations on pansharpening datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior outcomes compared to recent state-of-the-art~(SOTA) techniques, requiring only 15 sampling steps, which reduces over $90\%$ step compared with the benchmark diffusion models. Our experiments also include thorough discussions and ablation studies to underscore the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has revolutionized satellite remote sensing applications. However, this approach remains largely underexplored for airborne laser scanning (ALS), an important technology for applications such as forest management and urban planning. In this study, we address this gap by constructing a large-scale ALS point cloud dataset and evaluating its impact on downstream applications. Our dataset comprises ALS point clouds collected across the contiguous United States, provided by the United States Geological Survey's 3D Elevation Program. To ensure efficient data collection while capturing diverse land cover and terrain types, we introduce a geospatial sampling method that selects point cloud tiles based on land cover maps and digital elevation models. As a baseline self-supervised learning model, we adopt BEV-MAE, a state-of-the-art masked autoencoder for 3D outdoor point clouds, and pre-train it on the constructed dataset. The pre-trained models are subsequently fine-tuned for downstream tasks, including tree species classification, terrain scene recognition, and point cloud semantic segmentation. Our results show that the pre-trained models significantly outperform their scratch counterparts across all downstream tasks, demonstrating the transferability of the representations learned from the proposed dataset. Furthermore, we observe that scaling the dataset using our geospatial sampling method consistently enhances performance, whereas pre-training on datasets constructed with random sampling fails to achieve similar improvements. These findings highlight the utility of the constructed dataset and the effectiveness of our sampling strategy in the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. The source code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/martianxiu/ALS_pretraining}.

- **Summary**: Even if Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) have proven to be a relevant choice for integrating inference at the edge, they are often limited in terms of applicability. In this paper, we demonstrate that an ASIC neural network accelerator dedicated to image processing can be applied to multiple tasks of different levels: image classification and compression, while requiring a very limited hardware. The key component is a reconfigurable, mixed-precision (3b/2b/1b) encoder that takes advantage of proper weight and activation quantizations combined with convolutional layer structural pruning to lower hardware-related constraints (memory and computing). We introduce an automatic adaptation of linear symmetric quantizer scaling factors to perform quantized levels equalization, aiming at stabilizing quinary and ternary weights training. In addition, a proposed layer-shared Bit-Shift Normalization significantly simplifies the implementation of the hardware-expensive Batch Normalization. For a specific configuration in which the encoder design only requires 1Mb, the classification accuracy reaches 87.5% on CIFAR-10. Besides, we also show that this quantized encoder can be used to compress image patch-by-patch while the reconstruction can performed remotely, by a dedicated full-frame decoder. This solution typically enables an end-to-end compression almost without any block artifacts, outperforming patch-based state-of-the-art techniques employing a patch-constant bitrate.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Motion-X++, a large-scale multimodal 3D expressive whole-body human motion dataset. Existing motion datasets predominantly capture body-only poses, lacking facial expressions, hand gestures, and fine-grained pose descriptions, and are typically limited to lab settings with manually labeled text descriptions, thereby restricting their scalability. To address this issue, we develop a scalable annotation pipeline that can automatically capture 3D whole-body human motion and comprehensive textural labels from RGB videos and build the Motion-X dataset comprising 81.1K text-motion pairs. Furthermore, we extend Motion-X into Motion-X++ by improving the annotation pipeline, introducing more data modalities, and scaling up the data quantities. Motion-X++ provides 19.5M 3D whole-body pose annotations covering 120.5K motion sequences from massive scenes, 80.8K RGB videos, 45.3K audios, 19.5M frame-level whole-body pose descriptions, and 120.5K sequence-level semantic labels. Comprehensive experiments validate the accuracy of our annotation pipeline and highlight Motion-X++'s significant benefits for generating expressive, precise, and natural motion with paired multimodal labels supporting several downstream tasks, including text-driven whole-body motion generation,audio-driven motion generation, 3D whole-body human mesh recovery, and 2D whole-body keypoints estimation, etc.

- **Summary**: Monitoring complex assembly processes is critical for maintaining productivity and ensuring compliance with assembly standards. However, variability in human actions and subjective task preferences complicate accurate task anticipation and guidance. To address these challenges, we introduce the Multi-Modal Transformer Fusion and Recurrent Units (MMTFRU) Network for egocentric activity anticipation, utilizing multimodal fusion to improve prediction accuracy. Integrated with the Operator Action Monitoring Unit (OAMU), the system provides proactive operator guidance, preventing deviations in the assembly process. OAMU employs two strategies: (1) Top-5 MMTF-RU predictions, combined with a reference graph and an action dictionary, for next-step recommendations; and (2) Top-1 MMTF-RU predictions, integrated with a reference graph, for detecting sequence deviations and predicting anomaly scores via an entropy-informed confidence mechanism. We also introduce Time-Weighted Sequence Accuracy (TWSA) to evaluate operator efficiency and ensure timely task completion. Our approach is validated on the industrial Meccano dataset and the largescale EPIC-Kitchens-55 dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic environments.

- **Summary**: Tumor volume segmentation on MRI is a challenging and time-consuming process that is performed manually in typical clinical settings. This work presents an approach to automated delineation of head and neck tumors on MRI scans, developed in the context of the MICCAI Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation for MR-Guided Applications (HNTS-MRG) 2024 Challenge. Rather than designing a new, task-specific convolutional neural network, the focus of this research was to propose improvements to the configuration commonly used in medical segmentation tasks, relying solely on the traditional U-Net architecture. The empirical results presented in this article suggest the superiority of patch-wise normalization used for both training and sliding window inference. They also indicate that the performance of segmentation models can be enhanced by applying a scheduled data augmentation policy during training. Finally, it is shown that a small improvement in quality can be achieved by using Gaussian weighting to combine predictions for individual patches during sliding window inference. The model with the best configuration obtained an aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSCagg) of 0.749 in Task 1 and 0.710 in Task 2 on five cross-validation folds. The ensemble of five models (one best model per validation fold) showed consistent results on a private test set of 50 patients with an DSCagg of 0.752 in Task 1 and 0.718 in Task 2 (team name: andrei.iantsen).

- **Summary**: Most Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to date are trained predominantly on English data, which makes them struggle to understand non-English input and fail to generate output in the desired target language. Existing efforts mitigate these issues by adding multilingual training data, but do so in a largely ad-hoc manner, lacking insight into how different training mixes tip the scale for different groups of languages. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the training strategies for massively multilingual LVLMs. First, we conduct a series of multi-stage experiments spanning 13 downstream vision-language tasks and 43 languages, systematically examining: (1) the number of training languages that can be included without degrading English performance and (2) optimal language distributions of pre-training as well as (3) instruction-tuning data. Further, we (4) investigate how to improve multilingual text-in-image understanding, and introduce a new benchmark for the task. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that one can (i) include as many as 100 training languages simultaneously (ii) with as little as 25-50\% of non-English data, to greatly improve multilingual performance while retaining strong English performance. We further find that (iii) including non-English OCR data in pre-training and instruction-tuning is paramount for improving multilingual text-in-image understanding. Finally, we put all our findings together and train Centurio, a 100-language LVLM, offering state-of-the-art performance in an evaluation covering 14 tasks and 56 languages.

- **Summary**: The growing demand for controllable outputs in text-to-image generation has driven significant advancements in multi-instance generation (MIG), enabling users to define both instance layouts and attributes. Currently, the state-of-the-art methods in MIG are primarily adapter-based. However, these methods necessitate retraining a new adapter each time a more advanced model is released, resulting in significant resource consumption. A methodology named Depth-Driven Decoupled Instance Synthesis (3DIS) has been introduced, which decouples MIG into two distinct phases: 1) depth-based scene construction and 2) detail rendering with widely pre-trained depth control models. The 3DIS method requires adapter training solely during the scene construction phase, while enabling various models to perform training-free detail rendering. Initially, 3DIS focused on rendering techniques utilizing U-Net architectures such as SD1.5, SD2, and SDXL, without exploring the potential of recent DiT-based models like FLUX. In this paper, we present 3DIS-FLUX, an extension of the 3DIS framework that integrates the FLUX model for enhanced rendering capabilities. Specifically, we employ the FLUX.1-Depth-dev model for depth map controlled image generation and introduce a detail renderer that manipulates the Attention Mask in FLUX's Joint Attention mechanism based on layout information. This approach allows for the precise rendering of fine-grained attributes of each instance. Our experimental results indicate that 3DIS-FLUX, leveraging the FLUX model, outperforms the original 3DIS method, which utilized SD2 and SDXL, and surpasses current state-of-the-art adapter-based methods in terms of both performance and image quality.

- **Summary**: Real-time object detection takes an essential part in the decision-making process of numerous real-world applications, including collision avoidance and path planning in autonomous driving systems. This paper presents a novel real-time streaming perception method named CorrDiff, designed to tackle the challenge of delays in real-time detection systems. The main contribution of CorrDiff lies in its adaptive delay-aware detector, which is able to utilize runtime-estimated temporal cues to predict objects' locations for multiple future frames, and selectively produce predictions that matches real-world time, effectively compensating for any communication and computational delays. The proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by leveraging motion estimation and feature enhancement, both for 1) single-frame detection for the current frame or the next frame, in terms of the metric mAP, and 2) the prediction for (multiple) future frame(s), in terms of the metric sAP (The sAP metric is to evaluate object detection algorithms in streaming scenarios, factoring in both latency and accuracy). It demonstrates robust performance across a range of devices, from powerful Tesla V100 to modest RTX 2080Ti, achieving the highest level of perceptual accuracy on all platforms. Unlike most state-of-the-art methods that struggle to complete computation within a single frame on less powerful devices, CorrDiff meets the stringent real-time processing requirements on all kinds of devices. The experimental results emphasize the system's adaptability and its potential to significantly improve the safety and reliability for many real-world systems, such as autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation (DE) provides spatial information about a scene and enables tasks such as 3D reconstruction, object detection, and scene understanding. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using deep learning (DL)-based methods for DE. Traditional techniques rely on handcrafted features that often struggle to generalise to diverse scenes and require extensive manual tuning. However, DL models for DE can automatically extract relevant features from input data, adapt to various scene conditions, and generalise well to unseen environments. Numerous DL-based methods have been developed, making it necessary to survey and synthesize the state-of-the-art (SOTA). Previous reviews on DE have mainly focused on either monocular or stereo-based techniques, rather than comprehensively reviewing DE. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic literature review (SLR) that comprehensively focuses on DE. Therefore, this SLR study is being conducted. Initially, electronic databases were searched for relevant publications, resulting in 1284 publications. Using defined exclusion and quality criteria, 128 publications were shortlisted and further filtered to select 59 high-quality primary studies. These studies were analysed to extract data and answer defined research questions. Based on the results, DL methods were developed for mainly three different types of DE: monocular, stereo, and multi-view. 20 publicly available datasets were used to train, test, and evaluate DL models for DE, with KITTI, NYU Depth V2, and Make 3D being the most used datasets. 29 evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of DE. 35 base models were reported in the primary studies, and the top five most-used base models were ResNet-50, ResNet-18, ResNet-101, U-Net, and VGG-16. Finally, the lack of ground truth data was among the most significant challenges reported by primary studies.

- **Summary**: Blind face restoration is a highly ill-posed problem due to the lack of necessary context. Although existing methods produce high-quality outputs, they often fail to faithfully preserve the individual's identity. In this paper, we propose a personalized face restoration method, FaceMe, based on a diffusion model. Given a single or a few reference images, we use an identity encoder to extract identity-related features, which serve as prompts to guide the diffusion model in restoring high-quality and identity-consistent facial images. By simply combining identity-related features, we effectively minimize the impact of identity-irrelevant features during training and support any number of reference image inputs during inference. Additionally, thanks to the robustness of the identity encoder, synthesized images can be used as reference images during training, and identity changing during inference does not require fine-tuning the model. We also propose a pipeline for constructing a reference image training pool that simulates the poses and expressions that may appear in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our FaceMe can restore high-quality facial images while maintaining identity consistency, achieving excellent performance and robustness.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional performance in visual content understanding and reasoning. However, their inference efficiency has been a notable concern, as the increasing length of multimodal contexts leads to quadratic complexity. Token compression techniques, which reduce the number of visual tokens, have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing computational costs. Yet, these approaches have struggled to keep pace with the rapid advancements in MLLMs, especially the AnyRes strategy in the context of high-resolution image understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel token compression method, GlobalCom$^2$, tailored for high-resolution MLLMs that receive both the thumbnail and multiple crops. GlobalCom$^2$ treats the tokens derived from the thumbnail as the ``commander'' of the entire token compression process, directing the allocation of retention ratios and the specific compression for each crop. In this way, redundant tokens are eliminated while important local details are adaptively preserved to the highest extent feasible. Empirical results across 10 benchmarks reveal that GlobalCom$^2$ achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art token compression methods with LLaVA-NeXT-7B/13B models.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in image translation for enhancing mixed-exposure images have demonstrated the transformative potential of deep learning algorithms. However, addressing extreme exposure variations in images remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and contrast inconsistencies across regions. Current methods often struggle to adapt effectively to these variations, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose HipyrNet, a novel approach that integrates a HyperNetwork within a Laplacian Pyramid-based framework to tackle the challenges of mixed-exposure image enhancement. The inclusion of a HyperNetwork allows the model to adapt to these exposure variations. HyperNetworks dynamically generates weights for another network, allowing dynamic changes during deployment. In our model, the HyperNetwork employed is used to predict optimal kernels for Feature Pyramid decomposition, which enables a tailored and adaptive decomposition process for each input image. Our enhanced translational network incorporates multiscale decomposition and reconstruction, leveraging dynamic kernel prediction to capture and manipulate features across varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HipyrNet outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios with extreme exposure variations, achieving superior results in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our approach sets a new benchmark for mixed-exposure image enhancement, paving the way for future research in adaptive image translation.

- **Summary**: Infants develop complex visual understanding rapidly, even preceding of the acquisition of linguistic inputs. As computer vision seeks to replicate the human vision system, understanding infant visual development may offer valuable insights. In this paper, we present an interdisciplinary study exploring this question: can a computational model that imitates the infant learning process develop broader visual concepts that extend beyond the vocabulary it has heard, similar to how infants naturally learn? To investigate this, we analyze a recently published model in Science by Vong et al.,which is trained on longitudinal, egocentric images of a single child paired with transcribed parental speech. We introduce a training-free framework that can discover visual concept neurons hidden in the model's internal representations. Our findings show that these neurons can classify objects outside its original vocabulary. Furthermore, we compare the visual representations in infant-like models with those in moder computer vision models, such as CLIP or ImageNet pre-trained model, highlighting key similarities and differences. Ultimately, our work bridges cognitive science and computer vision by analyzing the internal representations of a computational model trained on an infant's visual and linguistic inputs.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have drawn researchers' attention to identifying cattle using muzzle images. However, CNNs often fail to capture long-range dependencies within the complex patterns of the muzzle. The transformers handle these challenges. This inspired us to fuse the strengths of CNNs and transformers in muzzle-based cattle identification. Addition and concatenation have been the most commonly used techniques for feature fusion. However, addition fails to preserve discriminative information, while concatenation results in an increase in dimensionality. Both methods are simple operations and cannot discover the relationships or interactions between fusing features. This research aims to overcome the issues faced by addition and concatenation. This research introduces a novel approach called Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) for the first time in cattle identification. MHAFF captures relations between the different types of fusing features while preserving their originality. The experiments show that MHAFF outperformed addition and concatenation techniques and the existing cattle identification methods in accuracy on two publicly available cattle datasets. MHAFF demonstrates excellent performance and quickly converges to achieve optimum accuracy of 99.88% and 99.52% in two cattle datasets simultaneously.

- **Summary**: We introduce a single-view reconstruction technique of volumetric fields in which multiple light scattering effects are omnipresent, such as in clouds. We model the unknown distribution of volumetric fields using an unconditional diffusion model trained on a novel benchmark dataset comprising 1,000 synthetically simulated volumetric density fields. The neural diffusion model is trained on the latent codes of a novel, diffusion-friendly, monoplanar representation. The generative model is used to incorporate a tailored parametric diffusion posterior sampling technique into different reconstruction tasks. A physically-based differentiable volume renderer is employed to provide gradients with respect to light transport in the latent space. This stands in contrast to classic NeRF approaches and makes the reconstructions better aligned with observed data. Through various experiments, we demonstrate single-view reconstruction of volumetric clouds at a previously unattainable quality.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has seen significant advancements with zero-shot approaches by leveraging the powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP. However, prior research works have predominantly focused on enhancing Far-OOD performance, while potentially compromising Near-OOD efficacy, as observed from our pilot study. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy to enhance zero-shot OOD detection performances for both Far-OOD and Near-OOD scenarios by innovatively harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) and VLMs. Our approach first exploit an LLM to generate superclasses of the ID labels and their corresponding background descriptions followed by feature extraction using CLIP. We then isolate the core semantic features for ID data by subtracting background features from the superclass features. The refined representation facilitates the selection of more appropriate negative labels for OOD data from a comprehensive candidate label set of WordNet, thereby enhancing the performance of zero-shot OOD detection in both scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce novel few-shot prompt tuning and visual prompt tuning to adapt the proposed framework to better align with the target distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, with an improvement of up to 2.9% in AUROC and a reduction of up to 12.6% in FPR95. Additionally, our method exhibits superior robustness against covariate shift across different domains, further highlighting its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: External cervical resorption (ECR) is a resorptive process affecting teeth. While in some patients, active resorption ceases and gets replaced by osseous tissue, in other cases, the resorption progresses and ultimately results in tooth loss. For proper ECR assessment, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is the recommended imaging modality, enabling a 3-D characterization of these lesions. While it is possible to manually identify and measure ECR resorption in CBCT scans, this process can be time intensive and highly subject to human error. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an automated method to identify and quantify the severity of ECR resorption using CBCT. Here, we present a method for ECR lesion segmentation that is based on automatic, binary classification of locally extracted voxel-wise texture features. We evaluate our method on 6 longitudinal CBCT datasets and show that certain texture-features can be used to accurately detect subtle CBCT signal changes due to ECR. We also present preliminary analyses clustering texture features within a lesion to stratify the defects and identify patterns indicative of calcification. These methods are important steps in developing prognostic biomarkers to predict whether ECR will continue to progress or cease, ultimately informing treatment decisions.

- **Summary**: Foreground segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, encompassing various subdivision tasks. Previous research has typically designed task-specific architectures for each task, leading to a lack of unification. Moreover, they primarily focus on recognizing foreground objects without effectively distinguishing them from the background. In this paper, we emphasize the importance of the background and its relationship with the foreground. We introduce FOCUS, the Foreground ObjeCts Universal Segmentation framework that can handle multiple foreground tasks. We develop a multi-scale semantic network using the edge information of objects to enhance image features. To achieve boundary-aware segmentation, we propose a novel distillation method, integrating the contrastive learning strategy to refine the prediction mask in multi-modal feature space. We conduct extensive experiments on a total of 13 datasets across 5 tasks, and the results demonstrate that FOCUS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art task-specific models on most metrics.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles rely on camera-based perception systems to comprehend their driving environment and make crucial decisions, thereby ensuring vehicles to steer safely. However, a significant threat known as Electromagnetic Signal Injection Attacks (ESIA) can distort the images captured by these cameras, leading to incorrect AI decisions and potentially compromising the safety of autonomous vehicles. Despite the serious implications of ESIA, there is limited understanding of its impacts on the robustness of AI models across various and complex driving scenarios. To address this gap, our research analyzes the performance of different models under ESIA, revealing their vulnerabilities to the attacks. Moreover, due to the challenges in obtaining real-world attack data, we develop a novel ESIA simulation method and generate a simulated attack dataset for different driving scenarios. Our research provides a comprehensive simulation and evaluation framework, aiming to enhance the development of more robust AI models and secure intelligent systems, ultimately contributing to the advancement of safer and more reliable technology across various fields.

- **Summary**: Late gadolinium enhancement MRI (LGE MRI) is the gold standard for the detection of myocardial scars for post myocardial infarction (MI). LGE MRI requires the injection of a contrast agent, which carries potential side effects and increases scanning time and patient discomfort. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that combines cardiac motion observed in cine MRI with image texture information to segment the myocardium and scar tissue in the left ventricle. Cardiac motion tracking can be formulated as a full cardiac image cycle registration problem, which can be solved via deep neural networks. Experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve scar segmentation based on non-contrasted cine images with comparable accuracy to LGE MRI. This demonstrates its potential as an alternative to contrast-enhanced techniques for scar detection.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently revolutionized novel view synthesis in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). However, existing SLAM methods utilizing 3DGS have failed to provide high-quality novel view rendering for monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras simultaneously. Notably, some methods perform well for RGB-D cameras but suffer significant degradation in rendering quality for monocular cameras. In this paper, we present Scaffold-SLAM, which delivers simultaneous localization and high-quality photorealistic mapping across monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras. We introduce two key innovations to achieve this state-of-the-art visual quality. First, we propose Appearance-from-Motion embedding, enabling 3D Gaussians to better model image appearance variations across different camera poses. Second, we introduce a frequency regularization pyramid to guide the distribution of Gaussians, allowing the model to effectively capture finer details in the scene. Extensive experiments on monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets demonstrate that Scaffold-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in photorealistic mapping quality, e.g., PSNR is 16.76% higher in the TUM RGB-D datasets for monocular cameras.

- **Summary**: Non-line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging systems collect light at a diffuse relay surface and input this measurement into computational algorithms that output a 3D volumetric reconstruction. These algorithms utilize the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to accelerate the reconstruction process but require both input and output to be sampled spatially with uniform grids. However, the geometry of NLOS imaging inherently results in non-uniform sampling on the relay surface when using multi-pixel detector arrays, even though such arrays significantly reduce acquisition times. Furthermore, using these arrays increases the data rate required for sensor readout, posing challenges for real-world deployment. In this work, we utilize the phasor field framework to demonstrate that existing NLOS imaging setups typically oversample the relay surface spatially, explaining why the measurement can be compressed without significantly sacrificing reconstruction quality. This enables us to utilize the Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT) to reconstruct from sparse measurements acquired from irregularly sampled relay surfaces of arbitrary shapes. Furthermore, we utilize the NUFFT to reconstruct at arbitrary locations in the hidden volume, ensuring flexible sampling schemes for both the input and output. Finally, we utilize the Scaled Fast Fourier Transform (SFFT) to reconstruct larger volumes without increasing the number of samples stored in memory. All algorithms introduced in this paper preserve the computational complexity of FFT-based methods, ensuring scalability for practical NLOS imaging applications.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation for autonomous driving is an even more challenging task when faced with adverse driving conditions. Standard models trained on data recorded under ideal conditions show a deteriorated performance in unfavorable weather or illumination conditions. Fine-tuning on the new task or condition would lead to overwriting the previously learned information resulting in catastrophic forgetting. Adapting to the new conditions through traditional domain adaption methods improves the performance on the target domain at the expense of the source domain. Addressing these issues, we propose an architecture-based domain-incremental learning approach called Progressive Semantic Segmentation (PSS). PSS is a task-agnostic, dynamically growing collection of domain-specific segmentation models. The task of inferring the domain and subsequently selecting the appropriate module for segmentation is carried out using a collection of convolutional autoencoders. We extensively evaluate our proposed approach using several datasets at varying levels of granularity in the categorization of adverse driving conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalization of the proposed approach to similar and unseen domains.

- **Summary**: 3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) has emerged as a prominent research topic, particularly in the realm of RGB-based methods. However, RGB images are susceptible to limitations such as sensitivity to lighting conditions and potential user discomfort. Consequently, multi-modal sensing, which leverages non-intrusive sensors, is gaining increasing attention. Nevertheless, multi-modal 3D HPE still faces challenges, including modality imbalance and the imperative for continual learning. In this work, we introduce a novel balanced continual multi-modal learning method for 3D HPE, which harnesses the power of RGB, LiDAR, mmWave, and WiFi. Specifically, we propose a Shapley value-based contribution algorithm to quantify the contribution of each modality and identify modality imbalance. To address this imbalance, we employ a re-learning strategy. Furthermore, recognizing that raw data is prone to noise contamination, we develop a novel denoising continual learning approach. This approach incorporates a noise identification and separation module to mitigate the adverse effects of noise and collaborates with the balanced learning strategy to enhance optimization. Additionally, an adaptive EWC mechanism is employed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-adopted multi-modal dataset, MM-Fi, which demonstrate the superiority of our approach in boosting 3D pose estimation and mitigating catastrophic forgetting in complex scenarios. We will release our codes.

- **Summary**: Cloud removal plays a crucial role in enhancing remote sensing image analysis, yet accurately reconstructing cloud-obscured regions remains a significant challenge. Recent advancements in generative models have made the generation of realistic images increasingly accessible, offering new opportunities for this task. Given the conceptual alignment between image generation and cloud removal tasks, generative models present a promising approach for addressing cloud removal in remote sensing. In this work, we propose a deep transfer learning approach built on a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework to explore the potential of the novel masked autoencoder (MAE) image reconstruction model in cloud removal. Due to the complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further propose using a patch-wise discriminator to determine whether each patch of the image is real or not. The proposed reconstructive transfer learning approach demonstrates significant improvements in cloud removal performance compared to other GAN-based methods. Additionally, whilst direct comparisons with some of the state-of-the-art cloud removal techniques are limited due to unclear details regarding their train/test data splits, the proposed model achieves competitive results based on available benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Digital Pathology is a cornerstone in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. A key task in this field is the identification and segmentation of cells in hematoxylin and eosin-stained images. Existing methods for cell segmentation often require extensive annotated datasets for training and are limited to a predefined cell classification scheme. To overcome these limitations, we propose $\text{CellViT}^{{\scriptscriptstyle ++}}$, a framework for generalized cell segmentation in digital pathology. $\text{CellViT}^{{\scriptscriptstyle ++}}$ utilizes Vision Transformers with foundation models as encoders to compute deep cell features and segmentation masks simultaneously. To adapt to unseen cell types, we rely on a computationally efficient approach. It requires minimal data for training and leads to a drastically reduced carbon footprint. We demonstrate excellent performance on seven different datasets, covering a broad spectrum of cell types, organs, and clinical settings. The framework achieves remarkable zero-shot segmentation and data-efficient cell-type classification. Furthermore, we show that $\text{CellViT}^{{\scriptscriptstyle ++}}$ can leverage immunofluorescence stainings to generate training datasets without the need for pathologist annotations. The automated dataset generation approach surpasses the performance of networks trained on manually labeled data, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating high-quality training datasets without expert annotations. To advance digital pathology, $\text{CellViT}^{{\scriptscriptstyle ++}}$ is available as an open-source framework featuring a user-friendly, web-based interface for visualization and annotation. The code is available under https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/CellViT-plus-plus.

- **Summary**: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify a mix of known and novel categories within unlabeled data sets, providing a more realistic setting for image recognition. Essentially, GCD needs to remember existing patterns thoroughly to recognize novel categories. Recent state-of-the-art method SimGCD transfers the knowledge from known-class data to the learning of novel classes through debiased learning. However, some patterns are catastrophically forgot during adaptation and thus lead to poor performance in novel categories classification. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning approach, LegoGCD, which is seamlessly integrated into previous methods to enhance the discrimination of novel classes while maintaining performance on previously encountered known classes. Specifically, we design two types of techniques termed as Local Entropy Regularization (LER) and Dual-views Kullback Leibler divergence constraint (DKL). The LER optimizes the distribution of potential known class samples in unlabeled data, thus ensuring the preservation of knowledge related to known categories while learning novel classes. Meanwhile, DKL introduces Kullback Leibler divergence to encourage the model to produce a similar prediction distribution of two view samples from the same image. In this way, it successfully avoids mismatched prediction and generates more reliable potential known class samples simultaneously. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed LegoGCD effectively addresses the known category forgetting issue across all datasets, eg, delivering a 7.74% and 2.51% accuracy boost on known and novel classes in CUB, respectively. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Cliffia123/LegoGCD.

- **Summary**: Calving front position variation of marine-terminating glaciers is an indicator of ice mass loss and a crucial parameter in numerical glacier models. Deep Learning (DL) systems can automatically extract this position from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, enabling continuous, weather- and illumination-independent, large-scale monitoring. This study presents the first comparison of DL systems on a common calving front benchmark dataset. A multi-annotator study with ten annotators is performed to contrast the best-performing DL system against human performance. The best DL model's outputs deviate 221 m on average, while the average deviation of the human annotators is 38 m. This significant difference shows that current DL systems do not yet match human performance and that further research is needed to enable fully automated monitoring of glacier calving fronts. The study of Vision Transformers, foundation models, and the inclusion and processing strategy of more information are identified as avenues for future research.

- **Summary**: The co-design of neural network architectures, quantization precisions, and hardware accelerators offers a promising approach to achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, particularly for model deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we propose the JAQ Framework, which jointly optimizes the three critical dimensions. However, effectively automating the design process across the vast search space of those three dimensions poses significant challenges, especially when pursuing extremely low-bit quantization. Specifical, the primary challenges include: (1) Memory overhead in software-side: Low-precision quantization-aware training can lead to significant memory usage due to storing large intermediate features and latent weights for back-propagation, potentially causing memory exhaustion. (2) Search time-consuming in hardware-side: The discrete nature of hardware parameters and the complex interplay between compiler optimizations and individual operators make the accelerator search time-consuming. To address these issues, JAQ mitigates the memory overhead through a channel-wise sparse quantization (CSQ) scheme, selectively applying quantization to the most sensitive components of the model during optimization. Additionally, JAQ designs BatchTile, which employs a hardware generation network to encode all possible tiling modes, thereby speeding up the search for the optimal compiler mapping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of JAQ, achieving approximately 7% higher Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet compared to previous methods and reducing the hardware search time per iteration to 0.15 seconds.

- **Summary**: With advances in diffusion models, image generation has shown significant performance improvements. This raises concerns about the potential abuse of image generation, such as the creation of explicit or violent images, commonly referred to as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. To address this, the Stable Diffusion model includes several safety checkers to censor initial text prompts and final output images generated from the model. However, recent research has shown that these safety checkers have vulnerabilities against adversarial attacks, allowing them to generate NSFW images. In this paper, we find that these adversarial attacks are not robust to small changes in text prompts or input latents. Based on this, we propose CROPS (Circular or RandOm Prompts for Safety), a model-agnostic framework that easily defends against adversarial attacks generating NSFW images without requiring additional training. Moreover, we develop an approach that utilizes one-step diffusion models for efficient NSFW detection (CROPS-1), further reducing computational resources. We demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of performance and applicability.

- **Summary**: Virtual Try-On (VTON) has become a crucial tool in ecommerce, enabling the realistic simulation of garments on individuals while preserving their original appearance and pose. Early VTON methods relied on single generative networks, but challenges remain in preserving fine-grained garment details due to limitations in feature extraction and fusion. To address these issues, recent approaches have adopted a dual-network paradigm, incorporating a complementary "ReferenceNet" to enhance garment feature extraction and fusion. While effective, this dual-network approach introduces significant computational overhead, limiting its scalability for high-resolution and long-duration image/video VTON applications. In this paper, we challenge the dual-network paradigm by proposing a novel single-network VTON method that overcomes the limitations of existing techniques. Our method, namely MNVTON, introduces a Modality-specific Normalization strategy that separately processes text, image and video inputs, enabling them to share the same attention layers in a VTON network. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it consistently achieves higher-quality, more detailed results for both image and video VTON tasks. Our results suggest that the single-network paradigm can rival the performance of dualnetwork approaches, offering a more efficient alternative for high-quality, scalable VTON applications.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in reconstructing detailed 3D scenes within multi-view setups and the emergence of large 2D human foundation models, we introduce Arc2Avatar, the first SDS-based method utilizing a human face foundation model as guidance with just a single image as input. To achieve that, we extend such a model for diverse-view human head generation by fine-tuning on synthetic data and modifying its conditioning. Our avatars maintain a dense correspondence with a human face mesh template, allowing blendshape-based expression generation. This is achieved through a modified 3DGS approach, connectivity regularizers, and a strategic initialization tailored for our task. Additionally, we propose an optional efficient SDS-based correction step to refine the blendshape expressions, enhancing realism and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that Arc2Avatar achieves state-of-the-art realism and identity preservation, effectively addressing color issues by allowing the use of very low guidance, enabled by our strong identity prior and initialization strategy, without compromising detail.

- **Summary**: Safe knife practices in the kitchen significantly reduce the risk of cuts, injuries, and serious accidents during food preparation. Using YOLOv7, an advanced object detection model, this study focuses on identifying safety risks during knife handling, particularly improper finger placement and blade contact with hand. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, and mAP50-95. The results demonstrate that YOLOv7 achieved its best performance at epoch 31, with a mAP50-95 score of 0.7879, precision of 0.9063, and recall of 0.7503. These findings highlight YOLOv7's potential to accurately detect knife-related hazards, promoting the development of improved kitchen safety.

- **Summary**: Training audio-to-image generative models requires an abundance of diverse audio-visual pairs that are semantically aligned. Such data is almost always curated from in-the-wild videos, given the cross-modal semantic correspondence that is inherent to them. In this work, we hypothesize that insisting on the absolute need for ground truth audio-visual correspondence, is not only unnecessary, but also leads to severe restrictions in scale, quality, and diversity of the data, ultimately impairing its use in the modern generative models. That is, we propose a scalable image sonification framework where instances from a variety of high-quality yet disjoint uni-modal origins can be artificially paired through a retrieval process that is empowered by reasoning capabilities of modern vision-language models. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we use our sonified images to train an audio-to-image generative model that performs competitively against state-of-the-art. Finally, through a series of ablation studies, we exhibit several intriguing auditory capabilities like semantic mixing and interpolation, loudness calibration and acoustic space modeling through reverberation that our model has implicitly developed to guide the image generation process.

- **Summary**: Brain cancer represents a major challenge in medical diagnostics, requisite precise and timely detection for effective treatment. Diagnosis initially relies on the proficiency of radiologists, which can cause difficulties and threats when the expertise is sparse. Despite the use of imaging resources, brain cancer remains often difficult, time-consuming, and vulnerable to intraclass variability. This study conveys the Bangladesh Brain Cancer MRI Dataset, containing 6,056 MRI images organized into three categories: Brain Tumor, Brain Glioma, and Brain Menin. The dataset was collected from several hospitals in Bangladesh, providing a diverse and realistic sample for research. We implemented advanced deep learning models, and DenseNet169 achieved exceptional results, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score all reaching 0.9983. In addition, Explainable AI (XAI) methods including GradCAM, GradCAM++, ScoreCAM, and LayerCAM were employed to provide visual representations of the decision-making processes of the models. In the context of brain cancer, these techniques highlight DenseNet169's potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy while simultaneously offering transparency, facilitating early diagnosis and better patient outcomes.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in 2D image generation have achieved remarkable quality,largely driven by the capacity of diffusion models and the availability of large-scale datasets. However, direct 3D generation is still constrained by the scarcity and lower fidelity of 3D datasets. In this paper, we introduce Zero-1-to-G, a novel approach that addresses this problem by enabling direct single-view generation on Gaussian splats using pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our key insight is that Gaussian splats, a 3D representation, can be decomposed into multi-view images encoding different attributes. This reframes the challenging task of direct 3D generation within a 2D diffusion framework, allowing us to leverage the rich priors of pretrained 2D diffusion models. To incorporate 3D awareness, we introduce cross-view and cross-attribute attention layers, which capture complex correlations and enforce 3D consistency across generated splats. This makes Zero-1-to-G the first direct image-to-3D generative model to effectively utilize pretrained 2D diffusion priors, enabling efficient training and improved generalization to unseen objects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate superior performance in 3D object generation, offering a new approach to high-quality 3D generation.

- **Summary**: When is it possible to project two sets of labeled points lying in a pair of projective planes to the same image on a projective line? We give a complete answer to this question and describe the loci of the projection centers that enable a common image. In particular, we find that there exists a solution to this problem if and only if these two sets are themselves images of a common pointset in projective space.

- **Summary**: The shape of human brain is complex and highly variable, with interactions between brain size, cortical folding, and age well-documented in the literature. However, few studies have explored how global brain size influences geometric features of the cortical surface derived from anatomical MRI. In this work, we focus on sulcal depth, an imaging phenotype that has gained significant attention in both basic research and clinical applications. We make key contributions to the field by: 1) providing the first quantitative analysis of how brain size affects sulcal depth measurements; 2) introducing a novel, scale-invariant method for sulcal depth estimation based on an original formalization of the problem; 3) presenting a validation framework and sharing our code and benchmark data with the community; and 4) demonstrating the biological relevance of our new sulcal depth measure using a large sample of 1,987 subjects spanning the developmental period from 26 weeks post-conception to adulthood.

- **Summary**: There is a widely-spread claim that GANs are difficult to train, and GAN architectures in the literature are littered with empirical tricks. We provide evidence against this claim and build a modern GAN baseline in a more principled manner. First, we derive a well-behaved regularized relativistic GAN loss that addresses issues of mode dropping and non-convergence that were previously tackled via a bag of ad-hoc tricks. We analyze our loss mathematically and prove that it admits local convergence guarantees, unlike most existing relativistic losses. Second, our new loss allows us to discard all ad-hoc tricks and replace outdated backbones used in common GANs with modern architectures. Using StyleGAN2 as an example, we present a roadmap of simplification and modernization that results in a new minimalist baseline -- R3GAN. Despite being simple, our approach surpasses StyleGAN2 on FFHQ, ImageNet, CIFAR, and Stacked MNIST datasets, and compares favorably against state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Video tokenizers are essential for latent video diffusion models, converting raw video data into spatiotemporally compressed latent spaces for efficient training. However, extending state-of-the-art video tokenizers to achieve a temporal compression ratio beyond 4x without increasing channel capacity poses significant challenges. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to enhance temporal compression. We find that the reconstruction quality of temporally subsampled videos from a low-compression encoder surpasses that of high-compression encoders applied to original videos. This indicates that high-compression models can leverage representations from lower-compression models. Building on this insight, we develop a bootstrapped high-temporal-compression model that progressively trains high-compression blocks atop well-trained lower-compression models. Our method includes a cross-level feature-mixing module to retain information from the pretrained low-compression model and guide higher-compression blocks to capture the remaining details from the full video sequence. Evaluation of video benchmarks shows that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality while increasing temporal compression compared to direct extensions of existing video tokenizers. Furthermore, the resulting compact latent space effectively trains a video diffusion model for high-quality video generation with a reduced token budget.

- **Summary**: The ability to organically reason over and with both text and images is a pillar of human intelligence, yet the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform such multimodal reasoning remains under-explored. Existing benchmarks often emphasize text-dominant reasoning or rely on shallow visual cues, failing to adequately assess integrated visual and textual reasoning. We introduce EMMA (Enhanced MultiModal reAsoning), a benchmark targeting organic multimodal reasoning across mathematics, physics, chemistry, and coding. EMMA tasks demand advanced cross-modal reasoning that cannot be addressed by reasoning independently in each modality, offering an enhanced test suite for MLLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on EMMA reveals significant limitations in handling complex multimodal and multi-step reasoning tasks, even with advanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time compute scaling underperforming. These findings underscore the need for improved multimodal architectures and training paradigms to close the gap between human and model reasoning in multimodality.

- **Summary**: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has made significant strides in distilling image-generative models for 3D generation. However, its maximum-likelihood-seeking behavior often leads to degraded visual quality and diversity, limiting its effectiveness in 3D applications. In this work, we propose Consistent Flow Distillation (CFD), which addresses these limitations. We begin by leveraging the gradient of the diffusion ODE or SDE sampling process to guide the 3D generation. From the gradient-based sampling perspective, we find that the consistency of 2D image flows across different viewpoints is important for high-quality 3D generation. To achieve this, we introduce multi-view consistent Gaussian noise on the 3D object, which can be rendered from various viewpoints to compute the flow gradient. Our experiments demonstrate that CFD, through consistent flows, significantly outperforms previous methods in text-to-3D generation.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models have undergone significant advancements over recent years. Many MDE models aim to predict affine-invariant relative depth from monocular images, while recent developments in large-scale training and vision foundation models enable reasonable estimation of metric (absolute) depth. However, effectively leveraging these predictions for geometric vision tasks, in particular relative pose estimation, remains relatively under explored. While depths provide rich constraints for cross-view image alignment, the intrinsic noise and ambiguity from the monocular depth priors present practical challenges to improving upon classic keypoint-based solutions. In this paper, we develop three solvers for relative pose estimation that explicitly account for independent affine (scale and shift) ambiguities, covering both calibrated and uncalibrated conditions. We further propose a hybrid estimation pipeline that combines our proposed solvers with classic point-based solvers and epipolar constraints. We find that the affine correction modeling is beneficial to not only the relative depth priors but also, surprisingly, the ``metric" ones. Results across multiple datasets demonstrate large improvements of our approach over classic keypoint-based baselines and PnP-based solutions, under both calibrated and uncalibrated setups. We also show that our method improves consistently with different feature matchers and MDE models, and can further benefit from very recent advances on both modules.

- **Summary**: Pumpkin leaf diseases are significant threats to agricultural productivity, requiring a timely and precise diagnosis for effective management. Traditional identification methods are laborious and susceptible to human error, emphasizing the necessity for automated solutions. This study employs on the "Pumpkin Leaf Disease Dataset", that comprises of 2000 high-resolution images separated into five categories. Downy mildew, powdery mildew, mosaic disease, bacterial leaf spot, and healthy leaves. The dataset was rigorously assembled from several agricultural fields to ensure a strong representation for model training. We explored many proficient deep learning architectures, including DenseNet201, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101 and InceptionResNetV2, and observed that ResNet50 performed most effectively, with an accuracy of 90.5% and comparable precision, recall, and F1-Score. We used Explainable AI (XAI) approaches like Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, and Layer-CAM to provide meaningful representations of model decision-making processes, which improved understanding and trust in automated disease diagnostics. These findings demonstrate ResNet50's potential to revolutionize pumpkin leaf disease detection, allowing for earlier and more accurate treatments.

- **Summary**: Large-scale AI model training divides work across thousands of GPUs, then synchronizes gradients across them at each step. This incurs a significant network burden that only centralized, monolithic clusters can support, driving up infrastructure costs and straining power systems. We propose Decentralized Diffusion Models, a scalable framework for distributing diffusion model training across independent clusters or datacenters by eliminating the dependence on a centralized, high-bandwidth networking fabric. Our method trains a set of expert diffusion models over partitions of the dataset, each in full isolation from one another. At inference time, the experts ensemble through a lightweight router. We show that the ensemble collectively optimizes the same objective as a single model trained over the whole dataset. This means we can divide the training burden among a number of "compute islands," lowering infrastructure costs and improving resilience to localized GPU failures. Decentralized diffusion models empower researchers to take advantage of smaller, more cost-effective and more readily available compute like on-demand GPU nodes rather than central integrated systems. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and LAION Aesthetics, showing that decentralized diffusion models FLOP-for-FLOP outperform standard diffusion models. We finally scale our approach to 24 billion parameters, demonstrating that high-quality diffusion models can now be trained with just eight individual GPU nodes in less than a week.

- **Summary**: Structured image understanding, such as interpreting tables and charts, requires strategically refocusing across various structures and texts within an image, forming a reasoning sequence to arrive at the final answer. However, current multimodal large language models (LLMs) lack this multihop selective attention capability. In this work, we introduce ReFocus, a simple yet effective framework that equips multimodal LLMs with the ability to generate "visual thoughts" by performing visual editing on the input image through code, shifting and refining their visual focuses. Specifically, ReFocus enables multimodal LLMs to generate Python codes to call tools and modify the input image, sequentially drawing boxes, highlighting sections, and masking out areas, thereby enhancing the visual reasoning process. We experiment upon a wide range of structured image understanding tasks involving tables and charts. ReFocus largely improves performance on all tasks over GPT-4o without visual editing, yielding an average gain of 11.0% on table tasks and 6.8% on chart tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of the effects of different visual edits, and reasons why ReFocus can improve the performance without introducing additional information. Further, we collect a 14k training set using ReFocus, and prove that such visual chain-of-thought with intermediate information offers a better supervision than standard VQA data, reaching a 8.0% average gain over the same model trained with QA pairs and 2.6% over CoT.

- **Summary**: We empirically study autoregressive pre-training from videos. To perform our study, we construct a series of autoregressive video models, called Toto. We treat videos as sequences of visual tokens and train transformer models to autoregressively predict future tokens. Our models are pre-trained on a diverse dataset of videos and images comprising over 1 trillion visual tokens. We explore different architectural, training, and inference design choices. We evaluate the learned visual representations on a range of downstream tasks including image recognition, video classification, object tracking, and robotics. Our results demonstrate that, despite minimal inductive biases, autoregressive pre-training leads to competitive performance across all benchmarks. Finally, we find that scaling our video models results in similar scaling curves to those seen in language models, albeit with a different rate. More details at https://brjathu.github.io/toto/
