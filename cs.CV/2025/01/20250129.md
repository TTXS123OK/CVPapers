- **Summary**: Watermarking, the practice of embedding imperceptible information into media such as images, videos, audio, and text, is essential for intellectual property protection, content provenance and attribution. The growing complexity of digital ecosystems necessitates watermarks for different uses to be embedded in the same media. However, to detect and decode all watermarks, they need to coexist well with one another. We perform the first study of coexistence of deep image watermarking methods and, contrary to intuition, we find that various open-source watermarks can coexist with only minor impacts on image quality and decoding robustness. The coexistence of watermarks also opens the avenue for ensembling watermarking methods. We show how ensembling can increase the overall message capacity and enable new trade-offs between capacity, accuracy, robustness and image quality, without needing to retrain the base models.

- **Summary**: This study presents the first report on the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) for automatic region segmentation of four-dimensional computer tomography (4D-CT) images during swallowing. The material consists of 4D-CT images taken during swallowing. Additionally, data for verifying the practicality of the AI were obtained from 4D-CT images during mastication and swallowing. The ground truth data for the region segmentation for the AI were created from five 4D-CT datasets of swallowing. A 3D convolutional model of nnU-Net was used for the AI. The learning and evaluation method for the AI was leave-one-out cross-validation. The number of epochs for training the nnU-Net was 100. The Dice coefficient was used as a metric to assess the AI's region segmentation accuracy. Regions with a median Dice coefficient of 0.7 or higher included the bolus, bones, tongue, and soft palate. Regions with a Dice coefficient below 0.7 included the thyroid cartilage and epiglottis. Factors that reduced the Dice coefficient included metal artifacts caused by dental crowns in the bolus and the speed of movement for the thyroid cartilage and epiglottis. In practical verification of the AI, no significant misrecognition was observed for facial bones, jaw bones, or the tongue. However, regions such as the hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, and epiglottis were not fully delineated during fast movement. It is expected that future research will improve the accuracy of the AI's region segmentation, though the risk of misrecognition will always exist. Therefore, the development of tools for efficiently correcting the AI's segmentation results is necessary. AI-based visualization is expected to contribute not only to the deepening of motion analysis of organs during swallowing but also to improving the accuracy of swallowing CT by clearly showing the current state of its precision.

- **Summary**: Spot spraying represents an efficient and sustainable method for reducing the amount of pesticides, particularly herbicides, used in agricultural fields. To achieve this, it is of utmost importance to reliably differentiate between crops and weeds, and even between individual weed species in situ and under real-time conditions. To assess suitability for real-time application, different object detection models that are currently state-of-the-art are compared. All available models of YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and RT-DETR are trained and evaluated with images from a real field situation. The images are separated into two distinct datasets: In the initial data set, each species of plants is trained individually; in the subsequent dataset, a distinction is made between monocotyledonous weeds, dicotyledonous weeds, and three chosen crops. The results demonstrate that while all models perform equally well in the metrics evaluated, the YOLOv9 models, particularly the YOLOv9s and YOLOv9e, stand out in terms of their strong recall scores (66.58 % and 72.36 %), as well as mAP50 (73.52 % and 79.86 %), and mAP50-95 (43.82 % and 47.00 %) in dataset 2. However, the RT-DETR models, especially RT-DETR-l, excel in precision with reaching 82.44 \% on dataset 1 and 81.46 % in dataset 2, making them particularly suitable for scenarios where minimizing false positives is critical. In particular, the smallest variants of the YOLO models (YOLOv8n, YOLOv9t, and YOLOv10n) achieve substantially faster inference times down to 7.58 ms for dataset 2 on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for analyzing one frame, while maintaining competitive accuracy, highlighting their potential for deployment in resource-constrained embedded computing devices as typically used in productive setups.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a range of multimodal tasks; however, their practical deployment is often constrained by high computational costs and prolonged inference times. Since the vision modality typically carries more information than the text modality, compressing visual prompts offers a promising solution to alleviate these challenges. Existing approaches predominantly focus on refining model architectures or directly reducing the number of visual tokens. However, these methods often compromise inference performance due to a lack of consideration for the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of visual data. In this work, we propose a token compression paradigm that operates on both spatial and temporal dimensions. Our approach includes a learning-free, plug-and-play compression pipeline that can be seamlessly integrated into most Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) frameworks. By leveraging this method, we enhance the model inference capability while simultaneously reducing its computational cost. Experimental results on the Video-QA task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing significant improvements in efficiency without sacrificing performance.

- **Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks mainly evaluate agents based on one-time execution of individual instructions across multiple environments, aiming to develop agents capable of functioning in any environment in a zero-shot manner. However, real-world navigation robots often operate in persistent environments with relatively consistent physical layouts, visual observations, and language styles from instructors. Such a gap in the task setting presents an opportunity to improve VLN agents by incorporating continuous adaptation to specific environments. To better reflect these real-world conditions, we introduce GSA-VLN, a novel task requiring agents to execute navigation instructions within a specific scene and simultaneously adapt to it for improved performance over time. To evaluate the proposed task, one has to address two challenges in existing VLN datasets: the lack of OOD data, and the limited number and style diversity of instructions for each scene. Therefore, we propose a new dataset, GSA-R2R, which significantly expands the diversity and quantity of environments and instructions for the R2R dataset to evaluate agent adaptability in both ID and OOD contexts. Furthermore, we design a three-stage instruction orchestration pipeline that leverages LLMs to refine speaker-generated instructions and apply role-playing techniques to rephrase instructions into different speaking styles. This is motivated by the observation that each individual user often has consistent signatures or preferences in their instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on GSA-R2R to thoroughly evaluate our dataset and benchmark various methods. Based on our findings, we propose a novel method, GR-DUET, which incorporates memory-based navigation graphs with an environment-specific training strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results on all GSA-R2R splits.

- **Summary**: We propose a first version of SIGN, a Statistically-Informed Gaze Network, to predict aggregate gaze times on images. We develop a foundational statistical model for which we derive a deep learning implementation involving CNNs and Visual Transformers, which enables the prediction of overall gaze times. The model enables us to derive from the aggregate gaze times the underlying gaze pattern as a probability map over all regions in the image, where each region's probability represents the likelihood of being gazed at across all possible scan-paths. We test SIGN's performance on AdGaze3500, a dataset of images of ads with aggregate gaze times, and on COCO-Search18, a dataset with individual-level fixation patterns collected during search. We demonstrate that SIGN (1) improves gaze duration prediction significantly over state-of-the-art deep learning benchmarks on both datasets, and (2) can deliver plausible gaze patterns that correspond to empirical fixation patterns in COCO-Search18. These results suggest that the first version of SIGN holds promise for gaze-time predictions and deserves further development.

- **Summary**: Computer programming textbooks and software documentations often contain flowcharts to illustrate the flow of an algorithm or procedure. Modern OCR engines often tag these flowcharts as graphics and ignore them in further processing. In this paper, we work towards making flowchart images machine-interpretable by converting them to executable Python codes. To this end, inspired by the recent success in natural language to code generation literature, we present a novel transformer-based framework, namely FloCo-T5. Our model is well-suited for this task,as it can effectively learn semantics, structure, and patterns of programming languages, which it leverages to generate syntactically correct code. We also used a task-specific pre-training objective to pre-train FloCo-T5 using a large number of logic-preserving augmented code samples. Further, to perform a rigorous study of this problem, we introduce theFloCo dataset that contains 11,884 flowchart images and their corresponding Python codes. Our experiments show promising results, and FloCo-T5 clearly outperforms related competitive baselines on code generation metrics. We make our dataset and implementation publicly available.

- **Summary**: Imaging inverse problems can be solved in an unsupervised manner using pre-trained diffusion models. In most cases, that involves approximating the gradient of the measurement-conditional score function in the reverse process. Since the approximations produced by existing methods are quite poor, especially early in the reverse process, we propose a new approach that re-estimates and renoises the image several times per diffusion step. Renoising adds carefully shaped colored noise that ensures the pre-trained diffusion model sees white-Gaussian error, in accordance with how it was trained. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our "DDfire" method at 20, 100, and 1000 neural function evaluations on linear inverse problems and phase retrieval.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of indoor point clouds has found various applications in the creation of digital twins for robotics, navigation and building information modeling (BIM). However, most existing datasets of labeled indoor point clouds have been acquired by photogrammetry. In contrast, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) can acquire dense sub-centimeter point clouds and has become the standard for surveyors. We present 3DSES (3D Segmentation of ESGT point clouds), a new dataset of indoor dense TLS colorized point clouds covering 427 m 2 of an engineering school. 3DSES has a unique double annotation format: semantic labels annotated at the point level alongside a full 3D CAD model of the building. We introduce a model-to-cloud algorithm for automated labeling of indoor point clouds using an existing 3D CAD model. 3DSES has 3 variants of various semantic and geometrical complexities. We show that our model-to-cloud alignment can produce pseudo-labels on our point clouds with a \&gt; 95% accuracy, allowing us to train deep models with significant time savings compared to manual labeling. First baselines on 3DSES show the difficulties encountered by existing models when segmenting objects relevant to BIM, such as light and safety utilities. We show that segmentation accuracy can be improved by leveraging pseudo-labels and Lidar intensity, an information rarely considered in current datasets. Code and data will be open sourced.

- **Summary**: 3D open-world classification is a challenging yet essential task in dynamic and unstructured real-world scenarios, requiring both open-category and open-pose recognition. To address these challenges, recent wisdom often takes sophisticated 2D pre-trained models to provide enriched and stable representations. However, these methods largely rely on how 3D objects can be projected into 2D space, which is unfortunately not well solved, and thus significantly limits their performance. Unlike these present efforts, in this paper we make a pioneering exploration of 3D generative models for 3D open-world classification. Drawing on abundant prior knowledge from 3D generative models, we additionally craft a rotation-invariant feature extractor. This innovative synergy endows our pipeline with the advantages of being training-free, open-category, and pose-invariant, thus well suited to 3D open-world classification. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the potential of generative models in 3D open-world classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ModelNet10 and McGill with 32.0% and 8.7% overall accuracy improvement, respectively.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the first-rank solution for the Multi-Modal Action Recognition Challenge, part of the Multi-Modal Visual Pattern Recognition Workshop at the \acl{ICPR} 2024. The competition aimed to recognize human actions using a diverse dataset of 20 action classes, collected from multi-modal sources. The proposed approach is built upon the \acl{TSM}, a technique aimed at efficiently capturing temporal dynamics in video data, incorporating multiple data input types. Our strategy included transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models, followed by meticulous fine-tuning on the challenge's specific dataset to optimize performance for the 20 action classes. We carefully selected a backbone network to balance computational efficiency and recognition accuracy and further refined the model using an ensemble technique that integrates outputs from different modalities. This ensemble approach proved crucial in boosting the overall performance. Our solution achieved a perfect top-1 accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in recognizing human actions across 20 classes. Our code is available online https://github.com/ffyyytt/TSM-MMVPR.

- **Summary**: Pancreatic NEuroendocrine Tumors (pNETs) are very rare endocrine neoplasms that account for less than 5% of all pancreatic malignancies, with an incidence of only 1-1.5 cases per 100,000. Early detection of pNETs is critical for improving patient survival, but the rarity of pNETs makes segmenting them from CT a very challenging problem. So far, there has not been a dataset specifically for pNETs available to researchers. To address this issue, we propose a pNETs dataset, a well-annotated Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) dataset focused exclusively on Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors, containing data from 469 patients. This is the first dataset solely dedicated to pNETs, distinguishing it from previous collections. Additionally, we provide the baseline detection networks with a new slice-wise weight loss function designed for the UNet-based model, improving the overall pNET segmentation performance. We hope that our dataset can enhance the understanding and diagnosis of pNET Tumors within the medical community, facilitate the development of more accurate diagnostic tools, and ultimately improve patient outcomes and advance the field of oncology.

- **Summary**: Mammographic screening is an effective method for detecting breast cancer, facilitating early diagnosis. However, the current need to manually inspect images places a heavy burden on healthcare systems, spurring a desire for automated diagnostic protocols. Techniques based on deep neural networks have been shown effective in some studies, but their tendency to overfit leaves considerable risk for poor generalisation and misdiagnosis, preventing their widespread adoption in clinical settings. Data augmentation schemes based on unpaired neural style transfer models have been proposed that improve generalisability by diversifying the representations of training image features in the absence of paired training data (images of the same tissue in either image style). But these models are similarly prone to various pathologies, and evaluating their performance is challenging without ground truths/large datasets (as is often the case in medical imaging). Here, we consider two frameworks/architectures: a GAN-based cycleGAN, and the more recently developed diffusion-based SynDiff. We evaluate their performance when trained on image patches parsed from three open access mammography datasets and one non-medical image dataset. We consider the use of uncertainty quantification to assess model trustworthiness, and propose a scheme to evaluate calibration quality in unpaired training scenarios. This ultimately helps facilitate the trustworthy use of image-to-image translation models in domains where ground truths are not typically available.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models have revolutionized cross-modal object retrieval, but text-based person search (TBPS) remains a challenging task due to limited data and fine-grained nature of the task. Existing methods primarily focus on aligning image-text pairs into a common representation space, often disregarding the fact that real world positive image-text pairs share a varied degree of similarity in between them. This leads models to prioritize easy pairs, and in some recent approaches, challenging samples are discarded as noise during training. In this work, we introduce a boosting technique that dynamically identifies and emphasizes these challenging samples during training. Our approach is motivated from classical boosting technique and dynamically updates the weights of the weak positives, wherein, the rank-1 match does not share the identity of the query. The weight allows these misranked pairs to contribute more towards the loss and the network has to pay more attention towards such samples. Our method achieves improved performance across four pedestrian datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed module.

- **Summary**: Understanding the traversability of terrain is essential for autonomous robot navigation, particularly in unstructured environments such as natural landscapes. Although traditional methods, such as occupancy mapping, provide a basic framework, they often fail to account for the complex mobility capabilities of some platforms such as legged robots. In this work, we propose a method for estimating terrain traversability by learning from demonstrations of human walking. Our approach leverages dense, pixel-wise feature embeddings generated using the DINOv2 vision Transformer model, which are processed through an encoder-decoder MLP architecture to analyze terrain segments. The averaged feature vectors, extracted from the masked regions of interest, are used to train the model in a reconstruction-based framework. By minimizing reconstruction loss, the network distinguishes between familiar terrain with a low reconstruction error and unfamiliar or hazardous terrain with a higher reconstruction error. This approach facilitates the detection of anomalies, allowing a legged robot to navigate more effectively through challenging terrain. We run real-world experiments on the ANYmal legged robot both indoor and outdoor to prove our proposed method. The code is open-source, while video demonstrations can be found on our website: https://rpl-cs-ucl.github.io/STEPP

- **Summary**: Confidence calibration is an emerging challenge in real-world decision systems based on foundations models when used for downstream vision classification tasks. Due to various reasons exposed, logit scores on the CLIP head remain large irrespective of whether the image-language pairs reconcile. It is difficult to address in data space, given the few-shot regime. We propose a penalty incorporated into loss objective that penalizes incorrect classifications whenever one is made during finetuning, by moving an amount of log-likelihood to the true class commensurate to the relative amplitudes of the two likelihoods. We refer to it as \textit{confidence misalignment penalty (CMP)}. Extensive experiments on $12$ vision datasets and $5$ domain generalization datasets supports the calibration performance of our method against stat-of-the-art. CMP outperforms the benchmarked prompt learning methods, demonstrating average improvement in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by average $6.01$\%, $4.01$ \% at minimum and $9.72$\% at maximum.

- **Summary**: Accurate surgical phase recognition is crucial for advancing computer-assisted interventions, yet the scarcity of labeled data hinders training reliable deep learning models. Semi-supervised learning (SSL), particularly with pseudo-labeling, shows promise over fully supervised methods but often lacks reliable pseudo-label assessment mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose a novel SSL framework, Dual Invariance Self-Training (DIST), that incorporates both Temporal and Transformation Invariance to enhance surgical phase recognition. Our two-step self-training process dynamically selects reliable pseudo-labels, ensuring robust pseudo-supervision. Our approach mitigates the risk of noisy pseudo-labels, steering decision boundaries toward true data distribution and improving generalization to unseen data. Evaluations on Cataract and Cholec80 datasets show our method outperforms state-of-the-art SSL approaches, consistently surpassing both supervised and SSL baselines across various network architectures.

- **Summary**: With growing concerns about user data collection, individualized privacy has emerged as a promising solution to balance protection and utility by accounting for diverse user privacy preferences. Instead of enforcing a uniform level of anonymization for all users, this approach allows individuals to choose privacy settings that align with their comfort levels. Building on this idea, we propose an adapted method for enabling Individualized Differential Privacy (IDP) in Federated Learning (FL) by handling clients according to their personal privacy preferences. By extending the SAMPLE algorithm from centralized settings to FL, we calculate client-specific sampling rates based on their heterogeneous privacy budgets and integrate them into a modified IDP-FedAvg algorithm. We test this method under realistic privacy distributions and multiple datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves clear improvements over uniform DP baselines, reducing the trade-off between privacy and utility. Compared to the alternative SCALE method in related work, which assigns differing noise scales to clients, our method performs notably better. However, challenges remain for complex tasks with non-i.i.d. data, primarily stemming from the constraints of the decentralized setting.

- **Summary**: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities for task specific fine-tuning. However, in scenarios that involve multiple tasks, training a separate LoRA model for each one results in considerable inefficiency in terms of storage and inference. Moreover, existing parameter generation methods fail to capture the correlations among these tasks, making multi-task LoRA parameter generation challenging. To address these limitations, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA), a novel approach that efficiently achieves task-specific customization of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we use training data from all tasks to train a tailored generator, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). CVAE takes task descriptions as inputs and produces task-aware LoRA weights as outputs. These LoRA weights are then merged with LLMs to create task-specialized models without the need for additional fine-tuning. Furthermore, we utilize in-context meta-learning for knowledge enhancement and task mapping, to capture the relationship between tasks and parameter distributions. As a result, our method achieves more accurate LoRA parameter generation for diverse tasks using CVAE. ICM-LoRA enables more accurate LoRA parameter reconstruction than current parameter reconstruction methods and is useful for implementing task-specific enhancements of LoRA parameters. At the same time, our method occupies 283MB, only 1\% storage compared with the original LoRA.

- **Summary**: Object removal is of great significance to 3D scene understanding, essential for applications in content filtering and scene editing. Current mainstream methods primarily focus on removing individual objects, with a few methods dedicated to eliminating an entire area or all objects of a certain category. They however confront the challenge of insufficient granularity and flexibility for real-world applications, where users demand tailored excision and preservation of objects within defined zones. In addition, most of the current methods require kinds of priors when addressing multi-view inpainting, which is time-consuming. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient and user-friendly pipeline for 3D multi-object removal, enabling users to flexibly select areas and define objects for removal or preservation. Concretely, to ensure object consistency and correspondence across multiple views, we propose a novel mask matching and refinement module, which integrates homography-based warping with high-confidence anchor points for segmentation. By leveraging the IoU joint shape context distance loss, we enhance the accuracy of warped masks and improve subsequent inpainting processes. Considering the current immaturity of 3D multi-object removal, we provide a new evaluation dataset to bridge the developmental void. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces computational costs, achieving processing speeds more than 80% faster than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining equivalent or higher reconstruction quality.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is an open-world task that aims to assign each pixel within an image to a specific class defined by arbitrary text descriptions. Recent advancements in large-scale vision-language models have demonstrated their open-vocabulary understanding capabilities, significantly facilitating the development of OVSS. However, most existing methods suffer from either suboptimal performance or long latency. This study introduces ERR-Seg, a novel framework that effectively reduces redundancy to balance accuracy and efficiency. ERR-Seg incorporates a training-free Channel Reduction Module (CRM) that leverages prior knowledge from vision-language models like CLIP to identify the most relevant classes while discarding others. Moreover, it incorporates Efficient Semantic Context Fusion (ESCF) with spatial-level and class-level sequence reduction strategies. CRM and ESCF result in substantial memory and computational savings without compromising accuracy. Additionally, recognizing the significance of hierarchical semantics extracted from middle-layer features for closed-set semantic segmentation, ERR-Seg introduces the Hierarchical Semantic Module (HSM) to exploit hierarchical semantics in the context of OVSS. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods under the ADE20K-847 setting, ERR-Seg achieves +$5.6\%$ mIoU improvement and reduces latency by $67.3\%$.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach for 3D scene reconstruction using 3D Gaussians. However, neither the centers nor surfaces of the Gaussians are accurately aligned to the object surface, complicating their direct use in point cloud and mesh reconstruction. Additionally, 3DGS typically produces floater artifacts, increasing the number of Gaussians and storage requirements. To address these issues, we present FeatureGS, which incorporates an additional geometric loss term based on an eigenvalue-derived 3D shape feature into the optimization process of 3DGS. The goal is to improve geometric accuracy and enhance properties of planar surfaces with reduced structural entropy in local 3D neighborhoods.We present four alternative formulations for the geometric loss term based on 'planarity' of Gaussians, as well as 'planarity', 'omnivariance', and 'eigenentropy' of Gaussian neighborhoods. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluations on 15 scenes of the DTU benchmark dataset focusing on following key aspects: Geometric accuracy and artifact-reduction, measured by the Chamfer distance, and memory efficiency, evaluated by the total number of Gaussians. Additionally, rendering quality is monitored by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio. FeatureGS achieves a 30 % improvement in geometric accuracy, reduces the number of Gaussians by 90 %, and suppresses floater artifacts, while maintaining comparable photometric rendering quality. The geometric loss with 'planarity' from Gaussians provides the highest geometric accuracy, while 'omnivariance' in Gaussian neighborhoods reduces floater artifacts and number of Gaussians the most. This makes FeatureGS a strong method for geometrically accurate, artifact-reduced and memory-efficient 3D scene reconstruction, enabling the direct use of Gaussian centers for geometric representation.

- **Summary**: Detecting novel anomalies in medical imaging is challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data for rare abnormalities, which often display high variability and subtlety. This challenge is further compounded when small abnormal regions are embedded within larger normal areas, as whole-image predictions frequently overlook these subtle deviations. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised Patch-GAN framework designed to detect and localize anomalies by capturing both local detail and global structure. Our framework first reconstructs masked images to learn fine-grained, normal-specific features, allowing for enhanced sensitivity to minor deviations from normality. By dividing these reconstructed images into patches and assessing the authenticity of each patch, our approach identifies anomalies at a more granular level, overcoming the limitations of whole-image evaluation. Additionally, a patch-ranking mechanism prioritizes regions with higher abnormal scores, reinforcing the alignment between local patch discrepancies and the global image context. Experimental results on the ISIC 2016 skin lesion and BraTS 2019 brain tumor datasets validate our framework's effectiveness, achieving AUCs of 95.79% and 96.05%, respectively, and outperforming three state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: This paper presents Contourformer, a real-time contour-based instance segmentation algorithm. The method is fully based on the DETR paradigm and achieves end-to-end inference through iterative and progressive mechanisms to optimize contours. To improve efficiency and accuracy, we develop two novel techniques: sub-contour decoupling mechanisms and contour fine-grained distribution refinement. In the sub-contour decoupling mechanism, we propose a deformable attention-based module that adaptively selects sampling regions based on the current predicted contour, enabling more effective capturing of object boundary information. Additionally, we design a multi-stage optimization process to enhance segmentation precision by progressively refining sub-contours. The contour fine-grained distribution refinement technique aims to further improve the ability to express fine details of contours. These innovations enable Contourformer to achieve stable and precise segmentation for each instance while maintaining real-time performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Contourformer on multiple benchmark datasets, including SBD, COCO, and KINS. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and inference speed. This work provides a new solution for contour-based instance segmentation tasks and lays a foundation for future research, with the potential to become a strong baseline method in this field.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel segmentation-aware joint training framework called generative reinforcement network (GRN) that integrates segmentation loss feedback to optimize both image generation and segmentation performance in a single stage. An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.

- **Summary**: Traditional remote spirometry lacks the precision required for effective pulmonary monitoring. We present a novel, non-invasive approach using multimodal predictive models that integrate RGB or thermal video data with patient metadata. Our method leverages energy-efficient Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for the regression of Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) and classification of Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), using lightweight CNNs to overcome SNN limitations in regression tasks. Multimodal data integration is improved with a Multi-Head Attention Layer, and we employ K-Fold validation and ensemble learning to boost robustness. Using thermal data, our SNN models achieve 92% accuracy on a breathing-cycle basis and 99.5% patient-wise. PEF regression models attain Relative RMSEs of 0.11 (thermal) and 0.26 (RGB), with an MAE of 4.52% for FEV1/FVC predictions, establishing state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Given the energy constraints in autonomous mobile agents (AMAs), such as unmanned vehicles, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are increasingly favored as a more efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks. AMAs employ multi-object detection (MOD) from multiple cameras to identify nearby objects while ensuring two essential objectives, (R1) timing guarantee and (R2) high accuracy for safety. In this paper, we propose RT-SNN, the first system design, aiming at achieving R1 and R2 in SNN-based MOD systems on AMAs. Leveraging the characteristic that SNNs gather feature data of input image termed as membrane potential, through iterative computation over multiple timesteps, RT-SNN provides multiple execution options with adjustable timesteps and a novel method for reusing membrane potential to support R1. Then, it captures how these execution strategies influence R2 by introducing a novel notion of mean absolute error and membrane confidence. Further, RT-SNN develops a new scheduling framework consisting of offline schedulability analysis for R1 and a run-time scheduling algorithm for R2 using the notion of membrane confidence. We deployed RT-SNN to Spiking-YOLO, the SNN-based MOD model derived from ANN-to-SNN conversion, and our experimental evaluation confirms its effectiveness in meeting the R1 and R2 requirements while providing significant energy efficiency.

- **Summary**: Face animation is a challenging task. Existing model-based methods (utilizing 3DMMs or landmarks) often result in a model-like reconstruction effect, which doesn't effectively preserve identity. Conversely, model-free approaches face challenges in attaining a decoupled and semantically rich feature space, thereby making accurate motion transfer difficult to achieve. We introduce the semantic facial descriptors in learnable disentangled vector space to address the dilemma. The approach involves decoupling the facial space into identity and motion subspaces while endowing each of them with semantics by learning complete orthogonal basis vectors. We obtain basis vector coefficients by employing an encoder on the source and driving faces, leading to effective facial descriptors in the identity and motion subspaces. Ultimately, these descriptors can be recombined as latent codes to animate faces. Our approach successfully addresses the issue of model-based methods' limitations in high-fidelity identity and the challenges faced by model-free methods in accurate motion transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging benchmarks (i.e. VoxCeleb, HDTF, CelebV). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our model outperforms SOTA methods with superior identity preservation and motion transfer.

- **Summary**: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly central to healthcare, the demand for explainable and trustworthy models is paramount. Current report generation systems for chest X-rays (CXR) often lack mechanisms for validating outputs without expert oversight, raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework designed to enhance the semantic alignment and localization accuracy of AI-generated medical reports. Our framework integrates two key modules: a Phrase Grounding Model, which identifies and localizes pathologies in CXR images based on textual prompts, and a Text-to-Image Diffusion Module, which generates synthetic CXR images from prompts while preserving anatomical fidelity. By comparing features between the original and generated images, we introduce a dual-scoring system: one score quantifies localization accuracy, while the other evaluates semantic consistency. This approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in pathology localization and text-to-image alignment. The integration of phrase grounding with diffusion models, coupled with the dual-scoring evaluation system, provides a robust mechanism for validating report quality, paving the way for more trustworthy and transparent AI in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system. Multimodal MRI is widely used for the preliminary screening of gliomas and plays a crucial role in auxiliary diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy, and prognostic evaluation. Currently, the computer-aided diagnostic studies of gliomas using MRI have focused on independent analysis events such as tumor segmentation, grading, and radiogenomic classification, without studying inter-dependencies among these events. In this study, we propose a Glioma Multimodal MRI Analysis System (GMMAS) that utilizes a deep learning network for processing multiple events simultaneously, leveraging their inter-dependencies through an uncertainty-based multi-task learning architecture and synchronously outputting tumor region segmentation, glioma histological subtype, IDH mutation genotype, and 1p/19q chromosome disorder status. Compared with the reported single-task analysis models, GMMAS improves the precision across tumor layered diagnostic tasks. Additionally, we have employed a two-stage semi-supervised learning method, enhancing model performance by fully exploiting both labeled and unlabeled MRI samples. Further, by utilizing an adaptation module based on knowledge self-distillation and contrastive learning for cross-modal feature extraction, GMMAS exhibited robustness in situations of modality absence and revealed the differing significance of each MRI modal. Finally, based on the analysis outputs of the GMMAS, we created a visual and user-friendly platform for doctors and patients, introducing GMMAS-GPT to generate personalized prognosis evaluations and suggestions.

Our method utilizes 3D Gaussian functions to represent animated human characters in diverse poses and outfits, which are extracted from monocular videos. We integrate Level of Detail (LoD) rendering to optimize computational efficiency and quality. The CrowdSplat framework consists of two stages: (1) avatar reconstruction and (2) crowd synthesis. The framework is also optimized for GPU memory usage to enhance scalability. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that CrowdSplat achieves good levels of rendering quality, memory efficiency, and computational performance. Through these experiments, we demonstrate that CrowdSplat is a viable solution for dynamic, realistic crowd simulation in real-time applications.

- **Summary**: The adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in critical fields where predictions need to be accompanied by justifications is hindered by their inherent black-box nature. In this paper, we introduce P-TAME (Perturbation-based Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations), a model-agnostic method for explaining DNN-based image classifiers. P-TAME employs an auxiliary image classifier to extract features from the input image, bypassing the need to tailor the explanation method to the internal architecture of the backbone classifier being explained. Unlike traditional perturbation-based methods, which have high computational requirements, P-TAME offers an efficient alternative by generating high-resolution explanations in a single forward pass during inference. We apply P-TAME to explain the decisions of VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B-16, three distinct and widely used image classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method matches or outperforms previous explainability methods, including model-specific approaches. Code and trained models will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Scene flow enables an understanding of the motion characteristics of the environment in the 3D world. It gains particular significance in the long-range, where object-based perception methods might fail due to sparse observations far away. Although significant advancements have been made in scene flow pipelines to handle large-scale point clouds, a gap remains in scalability with respect to long-range. We attribute this limitation to the common design choice of using dense feature grids, which scale quadratically with range. In this paper, we propose Sparse Scene Flow (SSF), a general pipeline for long-range scene flow, adopting a sparse convolution based backbone for feature extraction. This approach introduces a new challenge: a mismatch in size and ordering of sparse feature maps between time-sequential point scans. To address this, we propose a sparse feature fusion scheme, that augments the feature maps with virtual voxels at missing locations. Additionally, we propose a range-wise metric that implicitly gives greater importance to faraway points. Our method, SSF, achieves state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse2 dataset, demonstrating strong performance in long-range scene flow estimation.

- **Summary**: A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.

- **Summary**: Multimodal learning often relies on designing new models and complex training strategies to achieve optimal performance. We present Unified Unimodal Adaptation (U2A), which jointly fine-tunes pretrained unimodal encoders using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for various multimodal tasks. Our method significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and eliminates the need for complex training strategies, such as alternating training, gradient modifications, or unimodal fine-tuning. To address missing modalities during both training and testing, we introduce Mask Tokens (MT), which generate missing modality features from available modalities using a single token per modality. This simplifies the process, removing the need for specialized feature estimation or prompt-tuning methods. Our evaluation demonstrates that U2A matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both complete and missing modality settings, showcasing strong performance and robustness across various modalities, tasks, and datasets. We also analyze and report the effectiveness of Mask Tokens in different missing modality scenarios. Overall, our method provides a robust, flexible, and efficient solution for multimodal learning, with minimal computational overhead.

- **Summary**: Despite significant advancements in environment perception capabilities for autonomous driving and intelligent robotics, cameras and LiDARs remain notoriously unreliable in low-light conditions and adverse weather, which limits their effectiveness. Radar serves as a reliable and low-cost sensor that can effectively complement these limitations. However, radar-based object detection has been underexplored due to the inherent weaknesses of radar data, such as low resolution, high noise, and lack of visual information. In this paper, we present TransRAD, a novel 3D radar object detection model designed to address these challenges by leveraging the Retentive Vision Transformer (RMT) to more effectively learn features from information-dense radar Range-Azimuth-Doppler (RAD) data. Our approach leverages the Retentive Manhattan Self-Attention (MaSA) mechanism provided by RMT to incorporate explicit spatial priors, thereby enabling more accurate alignment with the spatial saliency characteristics of radar targets in RAD data and achieving precise 3D radar detection across Range-Azimuth-Doppler dimensions. Furthermore, we propose Location-Aware NMS to effectively mitigate the common issue of duplicate bounding boxes in deep radar object detection. The experimental results demonstrate that TransRAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both 2D and 3D radar detection tasks, achieving higher accuracy, faster inference speed, and reduced computational complexity.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing a 3D scene from images is challenging due to the different ways light interacts with surfaces depending on the viewer's position and the surface's material. In classical computer graphics, materials can be classified as diffuse or specular, interacting with light differently. The standard 3D Gaussian Splatting model struggles to represent view-dependent content, since it cannot differentiate an object within the scene from the light interacting with its specular surfaces, which produce highlights or reflections. In this paper, we propose to extend the 3D Gaussian Splatting model by introducing an additional symmetric matrix to enhance the opacity representation of each 3D Gaussian. This improvement allows certain Gaussians to be suppressed based on the viewer's perspective, resulting in a more accurate representation of view-dependent reflections and specular highlights without compromising the scene's integrity. By allowing the opacity to be view dependent, our enhanced model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-Nerf, Tanks\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Nerf-Synthetic datasets without a significant loss in rendering speed, achieving >60FPS, and only incurring a minimal increase in memory used.

- **Summary**: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images poses significant challenges due to unstable image quality, small object sizes, complex backgrounds, and environmental occlusions. Small objects, in particular, occupy minimal portions of images, making their accurate detection highly difficult. Existing multi-scale feature fusion methods address these challenges to some extent by aggregating features across different resolutions. However, these methods often fail to effectively balance classification and localization performance for small objects, primarily due to insufficient feature representation and imbalanced network information flow. In this paper, we propose a novel feature fusion framework specifically designed for UAV object detection tasks to enhance both localization accuracy and classification performance. The proposed framework integrates hybrid upsampling and downsampling modules, enabling feature maps from different network depths to be flexibly adjusted to arbitrary resolutions. This design facilitates cross-layer connections and multi-scale feature fusion, ensuring improved representation of small objects. Our approach leverages hybrid downsampling to enhance fine-grained feature representation, improving spatial localization of small targets, even under complex conditions. Simultaneously, the upsampling module aggregates global contextual information, optimizing feature consistency across scales and enhancing classification robustness in cluttered scenes. Experimental results on two public UAV datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Integrated into the YOLO-V10 model, our method achieves a 2\% improvement in average precision (AP) compared to the baseline YOLO-V10 model, while maintaining the same number of parameters. These results highlight the potential of our framework for accurate and efficient UAV object detection.

- **Summary**: This work presents a novel approach for pressure field reconstruction from image velocimetry data using SIREN (Sinusoidal Representation Network), emphasizing its effectiveness as an implicit neural representation in noisy environments and its mesh-free nature. While we briefly assess two recently proposed methods - one-shot matrix-omnidirectional integration (OS-MODI) and Green's function integral (GFI) - the primary focus is on the advantages of the SIREN approach. The OS-MODI technique performs well in noise-free conditions and with structured meshes but struggles when applied to unstructured meshes with high aspect ratio. Similarly, the GFI method encounters difficulties due to singularities inherent from the Newtonian kernel. In contrast, the proposed SIREN approach is a mesh-free method that directly reconstructs the pressure field, bypassing the need for an intrinsic grid connectivity and, hence, avoiding the challenges associated with ill-conditioned cells and unstructured meshes. This provides a distinct advantage over traditional mesh-based methods. Moreover, it is shown that changes in the architecture of the SIREN can be used to filter out inherent noise from velocimetry data. This work positions SIREN as a robust and versatile solution for pressure reconstruction, particularly in noisy environments characterized by the absence of mesh structure, opening new avenues for innovative applications in this field.

- **Summary**: Surgical guidance can be delivered in various ways. In neurosurgery, spatial guidance and orientation are predominantly achieved through neuronavigation systems that reference pre-operative MRI scans. Recently, there has been growing interest in providing live guidance by analyzing video feeds from tools such as endoscopes. Existing approaches, including anatomy detection, orientation feedback, phase recognition, and visual question-answering, primarily focus on aiding surgeons in assessing the current surgical scene. This work aims to provide guidance on a finer scale, aiming to provide guidance by forecasting the trajectory of the surgical instrument, essentially addressing the question of what to do next. To address this task, we propose a model that not only leverages the historical locations of surgical instruments but also integrates anatomical features. Importantly, our work does not rely on explicit ground truth labels for instrument trajectories. Instead, the ground truth is generated by a detection model trained to detect both anatomical structures and instruments within surgical videos of a comprehensive dataset containing pituitary surgery videos. By analyzing the interaction between anatomy and instrument movements in these videos and forecasting future instrument movements, we show that anatomical features are a valuable asset in addressing this challenging task. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to address this task for manually operated surgeries.

- **Summary**: Generative AI is transforming image synthesis, enabling the creation of high-quality, diverse, and photorealistic visuals across industries like design, media, healthcare, and autonomous systems. Advances in techniques such as image-to-image translation, text-to-image generation, domain transfer, and multimodal alignment have broadened the scope of automated visual content creation, supporting a wide spectrum of applications. These advancements are driven by models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), conditional frameworks, and diffusion-based approaches such as Stable Diffusion. This work presents a structured classification of image generation techniques based on the nature of the input, organizing methods by input modalities like noisy vectors, latent representations, and conditional inputs. We explore the principles behind these models, highlight key frameworks including DALL-E, ControlNet, and DeepSeek Janus-Pro, and address challenges such as computational costs, data biases, and output alignment with user intent. By offering this input-centric perspective, this study bridges technical depth with practical insights, providing researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive resource to harness generative AI for real-world applications.
