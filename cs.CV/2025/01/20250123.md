- **Summary**: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match individuals across different camera modalities, a critical task in modern surveillance systems. While current VI-ReID methods focus on cross-modality matching, real-world applications often involve mixed galleries containing both V and I images, where state-of-the-art methods show significant performance limitations due to large domain shifts and low discrimination across mixed modalities. This is because gallery images from the same modality may have lower domain gaps but correspond to different identities. This paper introduces a novel mixed-modal ReID setting, where galleries contain data from both modalities. To address the domain shift among inter-modal and low discrimination capacity in intra-modal matching, we propose the Mixed Modality-Erased and -Related (MixER) method. The MixER learning approach disentangles modality-specific and modality-shared identity information through orthogonal decomposition, modality-confusion, and ID-modality-related objectives. MixER enhances feature robustness across modalities, improving cross-modal and mixed-modal settings performance. Our extensive experiments on the SYSU-MM01, RegDB and LLMC datasets indicate that our approach can provide state-of-the-art results using a single backbone, and showcase the flexibility of our approach in mixed gallery applications.

- **Summary**: We introduce Deblur-Avatar, a novel framework for modeling high-fidelity, animatable 3D human avatars from motion-blurred monocular video inputs. Motion blur is prevalent in real-world dynamic video capture, especially due to human movements in 3D human avatar modeling. Existing methods either (1) assume sharp image inputs, failing to address the detail loss introduced by motion blur, or (2) mainly consider blur by camera movements, neglecting the human motion blur which is more common in animatable avatars. Our proposed approach integrates a human movement-based motion blur model into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly modeling human motion trajectories during exposure time, we jointly optimize the trajectories and 3D Gaussians to reconstruct sharp, high-quality human avatars. We employ a pose-dependent fusion mechanism to distinguish moving body regions, optimizing both blurred and sharp areas effectively. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Deblur-Avatar significantly outperforms existing methods in rendering quality and quantitative metrics, producing sharp avatar reconstructions and enabling real-time rendering under challenging motion blur conditions.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training and adversarial purification are two effective and practical defense methods to enhance a model's robustness against adversarial attacks. However, adversarial training necessitates additional training, while adversarial purification suffers from low time efficiency. More critically, current defenses are designed under the perturbation-based adversarial threat model, which is ineffective against the recently proposed unrestricted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient adversarial defense method that counters both perturbation-based and unrestricted adversarial attacks. Our defense is inspired by the observation that adversarial attacks are typically located near the decision boundary and are sensitive to pixel changes. To address this, we introduce adversarial anti-aliasing to mitigate adversarial modifications. Additionally, we propose adversarial super-resolution, which leverages prior knowledge from clean datasets to benignly recover images. These approaches do not require additional training and are computationally efficient without calculating gradients. Extensive experiments against both perturbation-based and unrestricted adversarial attacks demonstrate that our defense method outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial purification methods.

- **Summary**: Mobile exploration is a longstanding challenge in robotics, yet current methods primarily focus on active perception instead of active interaction, limiting the robot's ability to interact with and fully explore its environment. Existing robotic exploration approaches via active interaction are often restricted to tabletop scenes, neglecting the unique challenges posed by mobile exploration, such as large exploration spaces, complex action spaces, and diverse object relations. In this work, we introduce a 3D relational object graph that encodes diverse object relations and enables exploration through active interaction. We develop a system based on this representation and evaluate it across diverse scenes. Our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the system's effectiveness and generalization capabilities, outperforming methods that rely solely on vision-language models (VLMs).

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable generation capability. However, their training generally requires huge computational resources and large-scale datasets. To solve these, recent studies empower DMs with the advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique and propose retrieval-augmented diffusion models (RDMs). By incorporating rich knowledge from an auxiliary database, RAG enhances diffusion models' generation and generalization ability while significantly reducing model parameters. Despite the great success, RAG may introduce novel security issues that warrant further investigation. In this paper, we reveal that the RDM is susceptible to backdoor attacks by proposing a multimodal contrastive attack approach named BadRDM. Our framework fully considers RAG's characteristics and is devised to manipulate the retrieved items for given text triggers, thereby further controlling the generated contents. Specifically, we first insert a tiny portion of images into the retrieval database as target toxicity surrogates. Subsequently, a malicious variant of contrastive learning is adopted to inject backdoors into the retriever, which builds shortcuts from triggers to the toxicity surrogates. Furthermore, we enhance the attacks through novel entropy-based selection and generative augmentation strategies that can derive better toxicity surrogates. Extensive experiments on two mainstream tasks demonstrate the proposed BadRDM achieves outstanding attack effects while preserving the model's benign utility.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved performance on computer vision tasks. Previous image classification methods primarily modify model architectures or add features, and they optimize models using cross-entropy loss on class logits. Since they focus on classifying images with considering class labels, these methods may struggle to learn various \emph{aspects} of classes (e.g., natural positions and shape changes). Rethinking the previous approach from a novel view, we propose a multi-aspect knowledge distillation method using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach involves: 1) querying Large Language Model with multi-aspect questions relevant to the knowledge we want to transfer to the model, 2) extracting corresponding logits from MLLM, and 3) expanding the model's output dimensions to distill these multi-aspect logits. We then apply cross-entropy loss to class logits and binary cross-entropy loss to multi-aspect logits. Through our method, the model can learn not only the knowledge about visual aspects but also the abstract and complex aspects that require a deeper understanding. We primarily apply our method to image classification, and to explore the potential for extending our model, we expand it to other tasks, such as object detection. In all experimental results, our method improves the performance of the baselines. Additionally, we analyze the effect of multi-aspect knowledge distillation. These results demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge about various aspects to the model and the aspect knowledge can enhance model performance in computer vision tasks. This paper demonstrates the great potential of multi-aspect knowledge distillation, and we believe it offers a promising direction for future research in computer vision and beyond.

- **Summary**: Detecting objects in urban traffic images presents considerable difficulties because of the following reasons: 1) These images are typically immense in size, encompassing millions or even hundreds of millions of pixels, yet computational resources are constrained. 2) The small size of vehicles in certain scenarios leads to insufficient information for accurate detection. 3) The uneven distribution of vehicles causes inefficient use of computational resources. To address these issues, we propose YOLOSCM (You Only Look Once with Segmentation Clustering Module), an efficient and effective framework. To address the challenges of large-scale images and the non-uniform distribution of vehicles, we propose a Segmentation Clustering Module (SCM). This module adaptively identifies clustered regions, enabling the model to focus on these areas for more precise detection. Additionally, we propose a new training strategy to optimize the detection of small vehicles and densely packed targets in complex urban traffic scenes. We perform extensive experiments on urban traffic datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable progress in visual content generation. However, traditional diffusion models directly denoise the entire image from noisy inputs, disregarding the hierarchical structure present in visual signals. This method is computationally intensive, especially for high-resolution image generation. Signal processing often leverages hierarchical decompositions; for instance, Fourier analysis decomposes signals by frequency, while wavelet analysis captures localized frequency components, reflecting both spatial and frequency information simultaneously. Inspired by these principles, we propose a multiscale diffusion framework that generates hierarchical visual representations, which are subsequently integrated to form the final output. The diffusion model target, whether raw RGB pixels or latent features from a Variational Autoencoder, s divided into multiple components that each capture distinct spatial levels. The low-resolution component contains the primary informative signal, while higher-resolution components add high-frequency details, such as texture. This approach divides image generation into two stages: producing a low-resolution base signal, followed by a high-resolution residual signal. Both stages can be effectively modeled using simpler, lightweight transformer architectures compared to full-resolution generation. This decomposition is conceptually similar to wavelet decomposition but offers a more streamlined and intuitive design. Our method, termed MSF(short for Multi-Scale Factorization), achieves an FID of 2.2 and an IS of 255.4 on the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, reducing computational costs by 50% compared to baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is an essential tool in neuroimaging. It is arguably the sole noninvasive technique for examining the microstructural properties and structural connectivity of the brain. Recent years have seen the emergence of machine learning and data-driven approaches that enhance the speed, accuracy, and consistency of dMRI data analysis. However, traditional deep learning models often fell short, as they typically utilize pixel-level or volumetric patch-level embeddings similar to those used in structural MRI, and do not account for the unique distribution of various gradient encodings. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Polyhedra Encoding Transformer (PE-Transformer) for dMRI, designed specifically to handle spherical signals. Our approach involves projecting an icosahedral polygon onto a unit sphere to resample signals from predetermined directions. These resampled signals are then transformed into embeddings, which are processed by a transformer encoder that incorporates orientational information reflective of the icosahedral structure. Through experimental validation with various gradient encoding protocols, our method demonstrates superior accuracy in estimating multi-compartment models and Fiber Orientation Distributions (FOD), outperforming both conventional CNN architectures and standard transformers.

- **Summary**: Transformers have become increasingly popular for image super-resolution (SR) tasks due to their strong global context modeling capabilities. However, their quadratic computational complexity necessitates the use of window-based attention mechanisms, which restricts the receptive field and limits effective context expansion. Recently, the Mamba architecture has emerged as a promising alternative with linear computational complexity, allowing it to avoid window mechanisms and maintain a large receptive field. Nevertheless, Mamba faces challenges in handling long-context dependencies when high pixel-level precision is required, as in SR tasks. This is due to its hidden state mechanism, which can compress and store a substantial amount of context but only in an approximate manner, leading to inaccuracies that transformers do not suffer from. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Contrast}, a hybrid SR model that combines \textbf{Con}volutional, \textbf{Tra}nsformer, and \textbf{St}ate Space components, effectively blending the strengths of transformers and Mamba to address their individual limitations. By integrating transformer and state space mechanisms, \textbf{Contrast} compensates for the shortcomings of each approach, enhancing both global context modeling and pixel-level accuracy. We demonstrate that combining these two architectures allows us to mitigate the problems inherent in each, resulting in improved performance on image super-resolution tasks.

- **Summary**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) stands as an indispensable sensor for Earth observation, owing to its unique capability for all-day imaging. Nevertheless, in a data-driven era, the scarcity of large-scale datasets poses a significant bottleneck to advancing SAR automatic target recognition (ATR) technology. This paper introduces NUDT4MSTAR, a large-scale SAR dataset for vehicle target recognition in the wild, including 40 target types and a wide array of imaging conditions across 5 different scenes. NUDT4MSTAR represents a significant leap forward in dataset scale, containing over 190,000 images-tenfold the size of its predecessors. To enhance the utility of this dataset, we meticulously annotate each image with detailed target information and imaging conditions. We also provide data in both processed magnitude images and original complex formats. Then, we construct a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 7 experiments with 15 recognition methods focusing on the stable and effective ATR issues. Besides, we conduct transfer learning experiments utilizing various models trained on NUDT4MSTAR and applied to three other target datasets, thereby demonstrating its substantial potential to the broader field of ground objects ATR. Finally, we discuss this dataset's application value and ATR's significant challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this work marks the first-ever endeavor to create a large-scale dataset benchmark for fine-grained SAR recognition in the wild, featuring an extensive collection of exhaustively annotated vehicle images. We expect that the open source of NUDT4MSTAR will facilitate the development of SAR ATR and attract a wider community of researchers.

- **Summary**: The use of Sentinel-2 images to compute Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) has many applications, including water body area detection. However, cloud cover poses significant challenges in this regard, which hampers the effectiveness of Sentinel-2 images in this context. In this paper, we present a deep learning model that can generate NDWI given Sentinel-1 images, thereby overcoming this cloud barrier. We show the effectiveness of our model, where it demonstrates a high accuracy of 0.9134 and an AUC of 0.8656 to predict the NDWI. Additionally, we observe promising results with an R2 score of 0.4984 (for regressing the NDWI values) and a Mean IoU of 0.4139 (for the underlying segmentation task). In conclusion, our model offers a first and robust solution for generating NDWI images directly from Sentinel-1 images and subsequent use for various applications even under challenging conditions such as cloud cover and nighttime.



### Enhanced Extractor-Selector Framework and Symmetrization Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy for Edge Detections

- **Summary**: Recent advancements have demonstrated the effectiveness of the extractor-selector (E-S) framework in edge detection (ED) tasks, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality. However, this method still falls short of fully exploiting the potential of feature extractors, as selectors only operate on highly compressed feature maps that lack diversity and suffer from substantial information loss. Additionally, while union training can improve perceptual quality, the highest evaluation scores are typically obtained without it, creating a trade-off between quantitative accuracy and perceptual fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose an enhanced E-S architecture, which utilizes richer, less-loss feature representations and incorporates auxiliary features during the selection process, thereby improving the effectiveness of the feature selection mechanism. Additionally, we introduce a novel loss function, the Symmetrization Weight Binary Cross-Entropy (SWBCE), which simultaneously emphasizes both the recall of edge pixels and the suppression of erroneous edge predictions, thereby enhancing the predictions both in the perceptual quality and the prediction accuracy. The effectiveness and superiority of our approaches over baseline models, the standard E-S framework, and the standard Weight Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss function are demonstrated by extensive experiments. For example, our enhanced E-S architecture trained with SWBCE loss function achieves average improvements of 8.25$\%$, 8.01$\%$, and 33.25$\%$ in ODS, OIS, and AP, measured on BIPED2 compared with the baseline models, significantly outperforming the standard E-S method. The results set new benchmarks for ED tasks, and highlight the potential of the methods in beyond.

- **Summary**: Identifying individual animals within large wildlife populations is essential for effective wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts. Recent advancements in computer vision have shown promise in animal re-identification (Animal ReID) by leveraging data from camera traps. However, existing methods rely exclusively on visual data, neglecting environmental metadata that ecologists have identified as highly correlated with animal behavior and identity, such as temperature and circadian rhythms. To bridge this gap, we propose the Meta-Feature Adapter (MFA), a lightweight module designed to integrate environmental metadata into vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, to enhance Animal ReID performance. Our approach translates environmental metadata into natural language descriptions, encodes them into metadata-aware text embeddings, and incorporates these embeddings into image features through a cross-attention mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Gated Cross-Attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weights of metadata contributions, further improving performance. To validate our approach, we constructed the Metadata Augmented Animal Re-identification (MAAR) dataset, encompassing six species from New Zealand and featuring paired image data and environmental metadata. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFA consistently improves Animal ReID performance across multiple baseline models.

- **Summary**: Data-driven machine learning has made significant strides in medical image analysis. However, most existing methods are tailored to specific modalities and assume a particular resolution (often isotropic). This limits their generalizability in clinical settings, where variations in scan appearance arise from differences in sequence parameters, resolution, and orientation. Furthermore, most general-purpose models are designed for healthy subjects and suffer from performance degradation when pathology is present. We introduce UNA (Unraveling Normal Anatomy), the first modality-agnostic learning approach for normal brain anatomy reconstruction that can handle both healthy scans and cases with pathology. We propose a fluid-driven anomaly randomization method that generates an unlimited number of realistic pathology profiles on-the-fly. UNA is trained on a combination of synthetic and real data, and can be applied directly to real images with potential pathology without the need for fine-tuning. We demonstrate UNA's effectiveness in reconstructing healthy brain anatomy and showcase its direct application to anomaly detection, using both simulated and real images from 3D healthy and stroke datasets, including CT and MRI scans. By bridging the gap between healthy and diseased images, UNA enables the use of general-purpose models on diseased images, opening up new opportunities for large-scale analysis of uncurated clinical images in the presence of pathology. Code is available at https://github.com/peirong26/UNA.

- **Summary**: Foundation models hold transformative potential for medical imaging, but their clinical utility requires rigorous evaluation to address their strengths and limitations. This study introduces an evaluation framework for assessing the clinical impact and translatability of SAM, MedSAM, and SAM2, using musculoskeletal MRI as a case study. We tested these models across zero-shot and finetuned paradigms to assess their ability to process diverse anatomical structures and effectuate clinically reliable biomarkers, including cartilage thickness, muscle volume, and disc height. We engineered a modular pipeline emphasizing scalability, clinical relevance, and workflow integration, reducing manual effort and aligning validation with end-user expectations. Hierarchical modeling revealed how dataset mixing, anatomical complexity, and MRI acquisition parameters influence performance, providing insights into the role of imaging refinements in improving segmentation accuracy. This work demonstrates how clinically focused evaluations can connect computational advancements with tangible applications, creating a pathway for foundation models to address medical challenges. By emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration and aligning technical innovation with clinical priorities, our framework provides a roadmap for advancing machine learning technologies into scalable and impactful biomedical solutions.



### From Images to Point Clouds: An Efficient Solution for Cross-media Blind Quality Assessment without Annotated Training

- **Summary**: We present a novel quality assessment method which can predict the perceptual quality of point clouds from new scenes without available annotations by leveraging the rich prior knowledge in images, called the Distribution-Weighted Image-Transferred Point Cloud Quality Assessment (DWIT-PCQA). Recognizing the human visual system (HVS) as the decision-maker in quality assessment regardless of media types, we can emulate the evaluation criteria for human perception via neural networks and further transfer the capability of quality prediction from images to point clouds by leveraging the prior knowledge in the images. Specifically, domain adaptation (DA) can be leveraged to bridge the images and point clouds by aligning feature distributions of the two media in the same feature space. However, the different manifestations of distortions in images and point clouds make feature alignment a difficult task. To reduce the alignment difficulty and consider the different distortion distribution during alignment, we have derived formulas to decompose the optimization objective of the conventional DA into two suboptimization functions with distortion as a transition. Specifically, through network implementation, we propose the distortion-guided biased feature alignment which integrates existing/estimated distortion distribution into the adversarial DA framework, emphasizing common distortion patterns during feature alignment. Besides, we propose the quality-aware feature disentanglement to mitigate the destruction of the mapping from features to quality during alignment with biased distortions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits reliable performance compared to general blind PCQA methods without needing point cloud annotations.

- **Summary**: Robust training with noisy labels is a critical challenge in image classification, offering the potential to reduce reliance on costly clean-label datasets. Real-world datasets often contain a mix of in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) instance-dependent label noise, a challenge that is rarely addressed simultaneously by existing methods and is further compounded by the lack of comprehensive benchmarking datasets. Furthermore, even though current noisy-label learning approaches attempt to find noisy-label samples during training, these methods do not aim to estimate ID and OOD noise rates to promote their effectiveness in the selection of such noisy-label samples, and they are often represented by inefficient multi-stage learning algorithms. We propose the Adaptive Estimation of Instance-Dependent In-Distribution and Out-of-Distribution Label Noise (AEON) approach to address these research gaps. AEON is an efficient one-stage noisy-label learning methodology that dynamically estimates instance-dependent ID and OOD label noise rates to enhance robustness to complex noise settings. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark reflecting real-world ID and OOD noise scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AEON achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets

- **Summary**: Collocated clothing synthesis (CCS) has emerged as a pivotal topic in fashion technology, primarily concerned with the generation of a clothing item that harmoniously matches a given item. However, previous investigations have relied on using paired outfits, such as a pair of matching upper and lower clothing, to train a generative model for achieving this task. This reliance on the expertise of fashion professionals in the construction of such paired outfits has engendered a laborious and time-intensive process. In this paper, we introduce a new self-driven framework, named style- and texture-guided generative network (ST-Net), to synthesize collocated clothing without the necessity for paired outfits, leveraging self-supervised learning. ST-Net is designed to extrapolate fashion compatibility rules from the style and texture attributes of clothing, using a generative adversarial network. To facilitate the training and evaluation of our model, we have constructed a large-scale dataset specifically tailored for unsupervised CCS. Extensive experiments substantiate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both visual authenticity and fashion compatibility.

- **Summary**: In the field of deep learning-based computer vision, YOLO is revolutionary. With respect to deep learning models, YOLO is also the one that is evolving the most rapidly. Unfortunately, not every YOLO model possesses scholarly publications. Moreover, there exists a YOLO model that lacks a publicly accessible official architectural diagram. Naturally, this engenders challenges, such as complicating the understanding of how the model operates in practice. Furthermore, the review articles that are presently available do not delve into the specifics of each model. The objective of this study is to present a comprehensive and in-depth architecture comparison of the four most recent YOLO models, specifically YOLOv8 through YOLO11, thereby enabling readers to quickly grasp not only how each model functions, but also the distinctions between them. To analyze each YOLO version's architecture, we meticulously examined the relevant academic papers, documentation, and scrutinized the source code. The analysis reveals that while each version of YOLO has improvements in architecture and feature extraction, certain blocks remain unchanged. The lack of scholarly publications and official diagrams presents challenges for understanding the model's functionality and future enhancement. Future developers are encouraged to provide these resources.

- **Summary**: Recently, map representations based on radiance fields such as 3D Gaussian Splatting and NeRF, which excellent for realistic depiction, have attracted considerable attention, leading to attempts to combine them with SLAM. While these approaches can build highly realistic maps, large-scale SLAM still remains a challenge because they require a large number of Gaussian images for mapping and adjacent images as keyframes for tracking. We propose a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method, VIGS SLAM, that utilizes sensor fusion of RGB-D and IMU sensors for large-scale indoor environments. To reduce the computational load of 3DGS-based tracking, we adopt an ICP-based tracking framework that combines IMU preintegration to provide a good initial guess for accurate pose estimation. Our proposed method is the first to propose that Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM can be effectively performed in large-scale environments by integrating IMU sensor measurements. This proposal not only enhances the performance of Gaussian Splatting SLAM beyond room-scale scenarios but also achieves SLAM performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in large-scale indoor environments.

- **Summary**: Mapping and localization are crucial problems in robotics and autonomous driving. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled precise 3D mapping and scene understanding by rendering photo-realistic images. However, existing 3DGS methods often struggle to accurately reconstruct a 3D map that reflects the actual scale and geometry of the real world, which degrades localization performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS method called Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GeomGS). This method fully integrates LiDAR data into 3D Gaussian primitives via a probabilistic approach, as opposed to approaches that only use LiDAR as initial points or introduce simple constraints for Gaussian points. To this end, we introduce a Geometric Confidence Score (GCS), which identifies the structural reliability of each Gaussian point. The GCS is optimized simultaneously with Gaussians under probabilistic distance constraints to construct a precise structure. Furthermore, we propose a novel localization method that fully utilizes both the geometric and photometric properties of GeomGS. Our GeomGS demonstrates state-of-the-art geometric and localization performance across several benchmarks, while also improving photometric performance.

- **Summary**: Feature quality is paramount for classification performance, particularly in few-shot scenarios. Contrastive learning, a widely adopted technique for enhancing feature quality, leverages sample relations to extract intrinsic features that capture semantic information and has achieved remarkable success in Few-Shot Learning (FSL). Nevertheless, current few-shot contrastive learning approaches often overlook the semantic similarity discrepancies at different granularities when employing the same modeling approach for different sample relations, which limits the potential of few-shot contrastive learning. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective contrastive learning approach, Multi-Grained Relation Contrastive Learning (MGRCL), as a pre-training feature learning model to boost few-shot learning by meticulously modeling sample relations at different granularities. MGRCL categorizes sample relations into three types: intra-sample relation of the same sample under different transformations, intra-class relation of homogenous samples, and inter-class relation of inhomogeneous samples. In MGRCL, we design Transformation Consistency Learning (TCL) to ensure the rigorous semantic consistency of a sample under different transformations by aligning predictions of input pairs. Furthermore, to preserve discriminative information, we employ Class Contrastive Learning (CCL) to ensure that a sample is always closer to its homogenous samples than its inhomogeneous ones, as homogenous samples share similar semantic content while inhomogeneous samples have different semantic content. Our method is assessed across four popular FSL benchmarks, showing that such a simple pre-training feature learning method surpasses a majority of leading FSL methods. Moreover, our method can be incorporated into other FSL methods as the pre-trained model and help them obtain significant performance gains.

- **Summary**: Recently, large vision models have demonstrated powerful representation capabilities in the field of computer vision. However, we unexpectedly found that face recognition research is still mainly focused on CNN-based model architectures, which may lead to suboptimal state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in face recognition. Therefore, we study how to use various loss functions from historical research orthogonally to train a new state-of-the-art face recognition model based on large vision models, called LVFace. On the largest public face database, WebFace42M, we demonstrated the superiority of LVFace over other advanced face recognition methods and achieved first place in the ICCV21 MFR-Ongoing challenge, until the submission of this work (December 30, 2024, academic track).

- **Summary**: Parking space occupation detection using deep learning frameworks has seen significant advancements over the past few years. While these approaches effectively detect partial obstructions and adapt to varying lighting conditions, their performance significantly diminishes when haze is present. This paper proposes a novel hybrid model with a pre-trained feature extractor and a Pinball Generalized Twin Support Vector Machine (Pin-GTSVM) classifier, which removes the need for a dehazing system from the current State-of-The-Art hazy parking slot classification systems and is also insensitive to any atmospheric noise. The proposed system can seamlessly integrate with conventional smart parking infrastructures, leveraging a minimal number of cameras to monitor and manage hundreds of parking spaces efficiently. Its effectiveness has been evaluated against established parking space detection methods using the CNRPark Patches, PKLot, and a custom dataset specific to hazy parking scenarios. Furthermore, empirical results indicate a significant improvement in accuracy on a hazy parking system, thus emphasizing efficient atmospheric noise handling.



### Auto-Prompting SAM for Weakly Supervised Landslide Extraction

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised landslide extraction aims to identify landslide regions from remote sensing data using models trained with weak labels, particularly image-level labels. However, it is often challenged by the imprecise boundaries of the extracted objects due to the lack of pixel-wise supervision and the properties of landslide objects. To tackle these issues, we propose a simple yet effective method by auto-prompting the Segment Anything Model (SAM), i.e., APSAM. Instead of depending on high-quality class activation maps (CAMs) for pseudo-labeling or fine-tuning SAM, our method directly yields fine-grained segmentation masks from SAM inference through prompt engineering. Specifically, it adaptively generates hybrid prompts from the CAMs obtained by an object localization network. To provide sufficient information for SAM prompting, an adaptive prompt generation (APG) algorithm is designed to fully leverage the visual patterns of CAMs, enabling the efficient generation of pseudo-masks for landslide extraction. These informative prompts are able to identify the extent of landslide areas (box prompts) and denote the centers of landslide objects (point prompts), guiding SAM in landslide segmentation. Experimental results on high-resolution aerial and satellite datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving improvements of at least 3.0\% in F1 score and 3.69\% in IoU compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of Deepfake technology has enabled the generation of highly realistic manipulated videos, posing severe social and ethical challenges. Existing Deepfake detection methods primarily focused on either spatial or temporal inconsistencies, often neglecting the interplay between the two or suffering from interference caused by natural facial motions. To address these challenges, we propose the global context consistency flow (GC-ConsFlow), a novel dual-stream framework that effectively integrates spatial and temporal features for robust Deepfake detection. The global grouped context aggregation module (GGCA), integrated into the global context-aware frame flow stream (GCAF), enhances spatial feature extraction by aggregating grouped global context information, enabling the detection of subtle, spatial artifacts within frames. The flow-gradient temporal consistency stream (FGTC), rather than directly modeling the residuals, it is used to improve the robustness of temporal feature extraction against the inconsistency introduced by unnatural facial motion using optical flow residuals and gradient-based features. By combining these two streams, GC-ConsFlow demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness in capturing complementary spatiotemporal forgery traces. Extensive experiments show that GC-ConsFlow outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in detecting Deepfake videos under various compression scenarios.

- **Summary**: Existing structured pruning typically involves multi-stage training procedures that often demand heavy computation. Pruning at initialization, which aims to address this limitation, reduces training costs but struggles with performance. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient framework for one-cycle structured pruning without compromising model performance. In this approach, we integrate pre-training, pruning, and fine-tuning into a single training cycle, referred to as the `one cycle approach'. The core idea is to search for the optimal sub-network during the early stages of network training, guided by norm-based group saliency criteria and structured sparsity regularization. We introduce a novel pruning indicator that determines the stable pruning epoch by assessing the similarity between evolving pruning sub-networks across consecutive training epochs. Also, group sparsity regularization helps to accelerate the pruning process and results in speeding up the entire process. Extensive experiments on datasets, including CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet, using VGGNet, ResNet, MobileNet, and ViT architectures, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being one of the most efficient pruning frameworks in terms of training time. The source code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: While single-concept customization has been studied in 3D, multi-concept customization remains largely unexplored. To address this, we propose MultiDreamer3D that can generate coherent multi-concept 3D content in a divide-and-conquer manner. First, we generate 3D bounding boxes using an LLM-based layout controller. Next, a selective point cloud generator creates coarse point clouds for each concept. These point clouds are placed in the 3D bounding boxes and initialized into 3D Gaussian Splatting with concept labels, enabling precise identification of concept attributions in 2D projections. Finally, we refine 3D Gaussians via concept-aware interval score matching, guided by concept-aware diffusion. Our experimental results show that MultiDreamer3D not only ensures object presence and preserves the distinct identities of each concept but also successfully handles complex cases such as property change or interaction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the multi-concept customization in 3D.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in video generation have significantly impacted various downstream applications, particularly in identity-preserving video generation (IPT2V). However, existing methods struggle with "copy-paste" artifacts and low similarity issues, primarily due to their reliance on low-level facial image information. This dependence can result in rigid facial appearances and artifacts reflecting irrelevant details. To address these challenges, we propose EchoVideo, which employs two key strategies: (1) an Identity Image-Text Fusion Module (IITF) that integrates high-level semantic features from text, capturing clean facial identity representations while discarding occlusions, poses, and lighting variations to avoid the introduction of artifacts; (2) a two-stage training strategy, incorporating a stochastic method in the second phase to randomly utilize shallow facial information. The objective is to balance the enhancements in fidelity provided by shallow features while mitigating excessive reliance on them. This strategy encourages the model to utilize high-level features during training, ultimately fostering a more robust representation of facial identities. EchoVideo effectively preserves facial identities and maintains full-body integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves excellent results in generating high-quality, controllability and fidelity videos.

- **Summary**: Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. Furthermore, most works underutilize critical intersection information, including traffic signals, and behavior patterns induced by road structures. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework at signalized intersections dedicated to Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2XTraj). Our framework leverages dynamic graph attention to integrate knowledge from traffic signals and driving behaviors. A continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals from infrastructure devices. Additionally, leveraging the prior knowledge of the intersection topology, we propose a driving strategy awareness mechanism to model the joint distribution of goal intentions and maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, I2XTraj represents the first multi-agent trajectory prediction framework explicitly designed for infrastructure deployment, supplying subscribable prediction services to all vehicles at intersections. I2XTraj demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure dataset V2X-Seq and the aerial-view dataset SinD for signalized intersections. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms existing methods by more than 30% in both multi-agent and single-agent scenarios.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of Video-LLMs, advancing multimodal learning by bridging video data with language tasks. However, current video understanding models struggle with processing long video sequences, supporting multi-turn dialogues, and adapting to real-world dynamic scenarios. To address these issues, we propose StreamChat, a training-free framework for streaming video reasoning and conversational interaction. $\StreamChat$ leverages a novel hierarchical memory system to efficiently process and compress video features over extended sequences, enabling real-time, multi-turn dialogue. Our framework incorporates a parallel system scheduling strategy that enhances processing speed and reduces latency, ensuring robust performance in real-world applications. Furthermore, we introduce StreamBench, a versatile benchmark that evaluates streaming video understanding across diverse media types and interactive scenarios, including multi-turn interactions and complex reasoning tasks. Extensive evaluations on StreamBench and other public benchmarks demonstrate that StreamChat significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and response times, confirming its effectiveness for streaming video understanding.

- **Summary**: Annotating 3D medical images demands substantial time and expertise, driving the adoption of semi-supervised learning (SSL) for segmentation tasks. However, the complex anatomical structures of organs often lead to significant class imbalances, posing major challenges for deploying SSL in real-world scenarios. Despite the availability of valuable prior information, such as inter-organ relative positions and organ shape priors, existing SSL methods have yet to fully leverage these insights. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates textual anatomical knowledge (TAK) into the segmentation model. Specifically, we use GPT-4o to generate textual descriptions of anatomical priors, which are then encoded using a CLIP-based model. These encoded priors are injected into the segmentation model as parameters of the segmentation head. Additionally, contrastive learning is employed to enhance the alignment between textual priors and visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of generative models, the visual quality of generated images has become nearly indistinguishable from the real ones, posing challenges to content authenticity verification. Existing methods for detecting AI-generated images primarily focus on specific forgery clues, which are often tailored to particular generative models like GANs or diffusion models. These approaches struggle to generalize across architectures. Building on the observation that generative images often exhibit local anomalies, such as excessive smoothness, blurred textures, and unnatural pixel variations in small regions, we propose the localized discrepancy representation network (LDR-Net), a novel approach for detecting AI-generated images. LDR-Net captures smoothing artifacts and texture irregularities, which are common but often overlooked. It integrates two complementary modules: local gradient autocorrelation (LGA) which models local smoothing anomalies to detect smoothing anomalies, and local variation pattern (LVP) which captures unnatural regularities by modeling the complexity of image patterns. By merging LGA and LVP features, a comprehensive representation of localized discrepancies can be provided. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LDR-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting generated images and exhibits satisfactory generalization across unseen generative models. The code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

- **Summary**: Spiking neural networks are emerging as a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks due to their spike-driven paradigm. However, recent research in the SNN domain has mainly focused on enhancing accuracy by designing large-scale Transformer structures, which typically rely on substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this challenge, we propose a quantized spike-driven Transformer baseline (QSD-Transformer), which achieves reduced resource demands by utilizing a low bit-width parameter. Regrettably, the QSD-Transformer often suffers from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we first conduct empirical analysis and find that the bimodal distribution of quantized spike-driven self-attention (Q-SDSA) leads to spike information distortion (SID) during quantization, causing significant performance degradation. To mitigate this issue, we take inspiration from mutual information entropy and propose a bi-level optimization strategy to rectify the information distribution in Q-SDSA. Specifically, at the lower level, we introduce an information-enhanced LIF to rectify the information distribution in Q-SDSA. At the upper level, we propose a fine-grained distillation scheme for the QSD-Transformer to align the distribution in Q-SDSA with that in the counterpart ANN. By integrating the bi-level optimization strategy, the QSD-Transformer can attain enhanced energy efficiency without sacrificing its high-performance advantage.For instance, when compared to the prior SNN benchmark on ImageNet, the QSD-Transformer achieves 80.3\% top-1 accuracy, accompanied by significant reductions of 6.0$\times$ and 8.1$\times$ in power consumption and model size, respectively.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), including diffusion MRI (dMRI), serves as a ``microscope'' for anatomical structures and routinely mitigates the influence of low signal-to-noise ratio scans by compromising temporal or spatial resolution. However, these compromises fail to meet clinical demands for both efficiency and precision. Consequently, denoising is a vital preprocessing step, particularly for dMRI, where clean data is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce Di-Fusion, a fully self-supervised denoising method that leverages the latter diffusion steps and an adaptive sampling process. Unlike previous approaches, our single-stage framework achieves efficient and stable training without extra noise model training and offers adaptive and controllable results in the sampling process. Our thorough experiments on real and simulated data demonstrate that Di-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in microstructure modeling, tractography tracking, and other downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) addresses the challenge of adapting a pre-trained model to new domains without access to source data while minimizing the need for target domain annotations. This scenario is particularly relevant in real-world applications where data privacy, storage limitations, or labeling costs are significant concerns. Key challenges in SFADA include selecting the most informative samples from the target domain for labeling, effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled target data, and adapting the model without relying on source domain information. Additionally, existing methods often struggle with noisy or outlier samples and may require impractical progressive labeling during training. To effectively select more informative samples without frequently requesting human annotations, we propose the Propensity-driven Uncertainty Learning (ProULearn) framework. ProULearn utilizes a novel homogeneity propensity estimation mechanism combined with correlation index calculation to evaluate feature-level relationships. This approach enables the identification of representative and challenging samples while avoiding noisy outliers. Additionally, we develop a central correlation loss to refine pseudo-labels and create compact class distributions during adaptation. In this way, ProULearn effectively bridges the domain gap and maximizes adaptation performance. The principles of informative sample selection underlying ProULearn have broad implications beyond SFADA, offering benefits across various deep learning tasks where identifying key data points or features is crucial. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProULearn outperforms state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptation scenarios.

- **Summary**: Detecting actions as they occur is essential for applications like video surveillance, autonomous driving, and human-robot interaction. Known as online action detection, this task requires classifying actions in streaming videos, handling background noise, and coping with incomplete actions. Transformer architectures are the current state-of-the-art, yet the potential of recent advancements in computer vision, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), remains largely untapped for this problem, partly due to high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce TOAD: a Text-driven Online Action Detection architecture that supports zero-shot and few-shot learning. TOAD leverages CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) textual embeddings, enabling efficient use of VLMs without significant computational overhead. Our model achieves 82.46% mAP on the THUMOS14 dataset, outperforming existing methods, and sets new baselines for zero-shot and few-shot performance on the THUMOS14 and TVSeries datasets.

- **Summary**: Recently, foundational diffusion models have attracted considerable attention in image compression tasks, whereas their application to video compression remains largely unexplored. In this article, we introduce DiffVC, a diffusion-based perceptual neural video compression framework that effectively integrates foundational diffusion model with the video conditional coding paradigm. This framework uses temporal context from previously decoded frame and the reconstructed latent representation of the current frame to guide the diffusion model in generating high-quality results. To accelerate the iterative inference process of diffusion model, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Information Reuse (TDIR) strategy, which significantly enhances inference efficiency with minimal performance loss by reusing the diffusion information from previous frames. Additionally, to address the challenges posed by distortion differences across various bitrates, we propose the Quantization Parameter-based Prompting (QPP) mechanism, which utilizes quantization parameters as prompts fed into the foundational diffusion model to explicitly modulate intermediate features, thereby enabling a robust variable bitrate diffusion-based neural compression framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution delivers excellent performance in both perception metrics and visual quality.

- **Summary**: Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) is a challenging task that utilizes limited support images to segment associated unseen objects in query images. However, recent FSS methods are observed to perform worse, when enlarging the number of shots. As the support set enlarges, existing FSS networks struggle to concentrate on the high-contributed supports and could easily be overwhelmed by the low-contributed supports that could severely impair the mask predictions. In this work, we study this challenging issue, called support dilution, our goal is to recognize, select, preserve, and enhance those high-contributed supports in the raw support pool. Technically, our method contains three novel parts. First, we propose a contribution index, to quantitatively estimate if a high-contributed support dilutes. Second, we develop the Symmetric Correlation (SC) module to preserve and enhance the high-contributed support features, minimizing the distraction by the low-contributed features. Third, we design the Support Image Pruning operation, to retrieve a compact and high quality subset by discarding low-contributed supports. We conduct extensive experiments on two FSS benchmarks, COCO-20i and PASCAL-5i, the segmentation results demonstrate the compelling performance of our solution over state-of-the-art FSS approaches. Besides, we apply our solution for online segmentation and real-world segmentation, convincing segmentation results showing the practical ability of our work for real-world demonstrations.

- **Summary**: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a challenging task that requires understanding complex visual and temporal relationships within videos to answer questions accurately. In this work, we introduce \textbf{ReasVQA} (Reasoning-enhanced Video Question Answering), a novel approach that leverages reasoning processes generated by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the performance of VideoQA models. Our approach consists of three phases: reasoning generation, reasoning refinement, and learning from reasoning. First, we generate detailed reasoning processes using additional MLLMs, and second refine them via a filtering step to ensure data quality. Finally, we use the reasoning data, which might be in an imperfect form, to guide the VideoQA model via multi-task learning, on how to interpret and answer questions based on a given video. We evaluate ReasVQA on three popular benchmarks, and our results establish new state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements of +2.9 on NExT-QA, +7.3 on STAR, and +5.9 on IntentQA. Our findings demonstrate the supervising benefits of integrating reasoning processes into VideoQA. Further studies validate each component of our method, also with different backbones and MLLMs, and again highlight the advantages of this simple but effective method. We offer a new perspective on enhancing VideoQA performance by utilizing advanced reasoning techniques, setting a new benchmark in this research field.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generation models can create high-quality images from input prompts. However, they struggle to support the consistent generation of identity-preserving requirements for storytelling. Existing approaches to this problem typically require extensive training in large datasets or additional modifications to the original model architectures. This limits their applicability across different domains and diverse diffusion model configurations. In this paper, we first observe the inherent capability of language models, coined context consistency, to comprehend identity through context with a single prompt. Drawing inspiration from the inherent context consistency, we propose a novel training-free method for consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation, termed "One-Prompt-One-Story" (1Prompt1Story). Our approach 1Prompt1Story concatenates all prompts into a single input for T2I diffusion models, initially preserving character identities. We then refine the generation process using two novel techniques: Singular-Value Reweighting and Identity-Preserving Cross-Attention, ensuring better alignment with the input description for each frame. In our experiments, we compare our method against various existing consistent T2I generation approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness through quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting enhances real-time performance in novel view synthesis by representing scenes with mixtures of Gaussians and utilizing differentiable rasterization. However, it typically requires large storage capacity and high VRAM, demanding the design of effective pruning and compression techniques. Existing methods, while effective in some scenarios, struggle with scalability and fail to adapt models based on critical factors such as computing capabilities or bandwidth, requiring to re-train the model under different configurations. In this work, we propose a novel, model-agnostic technique that organizes Gaussians into several hierarchical layers, enabling progressive Level of Detail (LoD) strategy. This method, combined with recent approach of compression of 3DGS, allows a single model to instantly scale across several compression ratios, with minimal to none impact to quality compared to a single non-scalable model and without requiring re-training. We validate our approach on typical datasets and benchmarks, showcasing low distortion and substantial gains in terms of scalability and adaptability.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced autonomous driving (AD) by enhancing reasoning capabilities; however, these models remain highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. While existing research has explored white-box attacks to some extent, the more practical and challenging black-box scenarios remain largely underexplored due to their inherent difficulty. In this paper, we take the first step toward designing black-box adversarial attacks specifically targeting VLMs in AD. We identify two key challenges for achieving effective black-box attacks in this context: the effectiveness across driving reasoning chains in AD systems and the dynamic nature of driving scenarios. To address this, we propose Cascading Adversarial Disruption (CAD). It first introduces Decision Chain Disruption, which targets low-level reasoning breakdown by generating and injecting deceptive semantics, ensuring the perturbations remain effective across the entire decision-making chain. Building on this, we present Risky Scene Induction, which addresses dynamic adaptation by leveraging a surrogate VLM to understand and construct high-level risky scenarios that are likely to result in critical errors in the current driving contexts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple AD VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that CAD achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing methods (+13.43% on average). Moreover, we validate its practical applicability through real-world attacks on AD vehicles powered by VLMs, where the route completion rate drops by 61.11% and the vehicle crashes directly into the obstacle vehicle with adversarial patches. Finally, we release CADA dataset, comprising 18,808 adversarial visual-question-answer pairs, to facilitate further evaluation and research in this critical domain. Our codes and dataset will be available after paper's acceptance.

- **Summary**: Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in complex visual tasks provides valuable insights into their potential and limitations. In this work, we assess the performance of VLMs on the challenging Bongard Openworld Problems benchmark, which involves reasoning over natural images. We propose and evaluate three human-inspired paradigms: holistic analysis (global context processing), deductive rule learning (explicit rule derivation and application), and componential analysis (structured decomposition of images into components). Our results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o and Gemini, not only surpass human benchmarks but also excel in structured reasoning tasks, with componential analysis proving especially effective. However, ablation studies reveal key challenges, such as handling synthetic images, making fine-grained distinctions, and interpreting nuanced contextual information. These insights underscore the need for further advancements in model robustness and generalization, while highlighting the transformative potential of structured reasoning approaches in enhancing VLM capabilities.

- **Summary**: State Space Models (SSMs), as key components of Mamaba, have gained increasing attention for vision models recently, thanks to their efficient long sequence modeling capability. Given the computational cost of deploying SSMs on resource-limited edge devices, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a technique with the potential for efficient deployment of SSMs. In this work, we propose QMamba, one of the first PTQ frameworks to our knowledge, designed for vision SSMs based on the analysis of the activation distributions in SSMs. We reveal that the distribution of discrete parameters exhibits long-tailed skewness and the distribution of the hidden state sequence exhibits highly dynamic variations. Correspondingly, we design Long-tailed Skewness Quantization (LtSQ) to quantize discrete parameters and Temporal Group Quantization (TGQ) to quantize hidden states, which reduces the quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QMamba outperforms advanced PTQ methods on vision models across multiple model sizes and architectures. Notably, QMamba surpasses existing methods by 21.0% on ImageNet classification with 4-bit activations.

- **Summary**: Medical image analysis suffers from a lack of labeled data due to several challenges including patient privacy and lack of experts. Although some AI models only perform well with large amounts of data, we will move to data augmentation where there is a solution to improve the performance of our models and increase the dataset size through traditional or advanced techniques. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques on two different medical image datasets. In the first step, we applied some transformation techniques to the skin cancer dataset containing benign and malignant classes. Then, we trained the convolutional neural network (CNN) on the dataset before and after augmentation, which significantly improved test accuracy from 90.74% to 96.88% and decreased test loss from 0.7921 to 0.1468 after augmentation. In the second step, we used the Mixup technique by mixing two random images and their corresponding masks using the retina and blood vessels dataset, then we trained the U-net model and obtained the Dice coefficient which increased from 0 before augmentation to 0.4163 after augmentation. The result shows the effect of using data augmentation to increase the dataset size on the classification and segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in a video according to textual descriptions, which requires the integration of multimodal information and temporal dynamics perception. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown great effectiveness across various video segmentation tasks. However, its application to offline RVOS is challenged by the translation of the text into effective prompts and a lack of global context awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel RVOS framework, termed MPG-SAM 2, to address these challenges. Specifically, MPG-SAM 2 employs a unified multimodal encoder to jointly encode video and textual features, generating semantically aligned video and text embeddings, along with multimodal class tokens. A mask prior generator utilizes the video embeddings and class tokens to create pseudo masks of target objects and global context. These masks are fed into the prompt encoder as dense prompts along with multimodal class tokens as sparse prompts to generate accurate prompts for SAM 2. To provide the online SAM 2 with a global view, we introduce a hierarchical global-historical aggregator, which allows SAM 2 to aggregate global and historical information of target objects at both pixel and object levels, enhancing the target representation and temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on several RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MPG-SAM 2 and the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

- **Summary**: Background: Multiparametric breast MRI data might improve tumor diagnostics, characterization, and treatment planning. Accurate alignment and delineation of images acquired at different field strengths such as 3T and 7T, remain challenging research tasks. Purpose: To address alignment challenges and enable consistent tumor segmentation across different MRI field strengths. Study type: Retrospective. Subjects: Nine female subjects with breast tumors were involved: six histologically proven invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) and three fibroadenomas. Field strength/sequence: Imaging was performed at 3T and 7T scanners using post-contrast T1-weighted three-dimensional time-resolved angiography with stochastic trajectories (TWIST) sequence. Assessments: The method's performance for joint image registration and tumor segmentation was evaluated using several quantitative metrics, including signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), normalized cross-correlation (NCC), Dice coefficient, F1 score, and relative sum of squared differences (rel SSD). Statistical tests: The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to test the relationship between the registration and segmentation metrics. Results: When calculated for each subject individually, the PSNR was in a range from 27.5 to 34.5 dB, and the SSIM was from 82.6 to 92.8%. The model achieved an NCC from 96.4 to 99.3% and a Dice coefficient of 62.9 to 95.3%. The F1 score was between 55.4 and 93.2% and the rel SSD was in the range of 2.0 and 7.5%. The segmentation metrics Dice and F1 Score are highly correlated (0.995), while a moderate correlation between NCC and SSIM (0.681) was found for registration. Data conclusion: Initial results demonstrate that the proposed method may be feasible in providing joint tumor segmentation and registration of MRI data acquired at different field strengths.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly broadened the possibilities for editing images of real-world objects. However, performing non-rigid transformations, such as changing the pose of objects or image-based conditioning, remains challenging. Maintaining object identity during these edits is difficult, and current methods often fall short of the precision needed for industrial applications, where consistency is critical. Additionally, fine-tuning diffusion models requires custom training data, which is not always accessible in real-world scenarios. This work introduces FashionRepose, a training-free pipeline for non-rigid pose editing specifically designed for the fashion industry. The approach integrates off-the-shelf models to adjust poses of long-sleeve garments, maintaining identity and branding attributes. FashionRepose uses a zero-shot approach to perform these edits in near real-time, eliminating the need for specialized training. consistent image editing. The solution holds potential for applications in the fashion industry and other fields demanding identity preservation in image editing.

- **Summary**: The event-based Vision-Language Model (VLM) recently has made good progress for practical vision tasks. However, most of these works just utilize CLIP for focusing on traditional perception tasks, which obstruct model understanding explicitly the sufficient semantics and context from event streams. To address the deficiency, we propose EventVL, the first generative event-based MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model) framework for explicit semantic understanding. Specifically, to bridge the data gap for connecting different modalities semantics, we first annotate a large event-image/video-text dataset, containing almost 1.4 million high-quality pairs of data, which enables effective learning across various scenes, e.g., drive scene or human motion. After that, we design Event Spatiotemporal Representation to fully explore the comprehensive information by diversely aggregating and segmenting the event stream. To further promote a compact semantic space, Dynamic Semantic Alignment is introduced to improve and complete sparse semantic spaces of events. Extensive experiments show that our EventVL can significantly surpass existing MLLM baselines in event captioning and scene description generation tasks. We hope our research could contribute to the development of the event vision community.

- **Summary**: I introduce two novel loss functions for classification in deep learning. The two loss functions extend standard cross entropy loss by regularizing it with minimum entropy and Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence terms. The first of the two novel loss functions is termed mixed entropy loss (MIX-ENT for short), while the second one is termed minimum entropy regularized cross-entropy loss (MIN-ENT for short). The MIX-ENT function introduces a regularizer that can be shown to be equivalent to the sum of a minimum entropy term and a K-L divergence term. However, it should be noted that the K-L divergence term here is different from that in the standard cross-entropy loss function, in the sense that it swaps the roles of the target probability and the hypothesis probability. The MIN-ENT function simply adds a minimum entropy regularizer to the standard cross entropy loss function. In both MIX-ENT and MIN-ENT, the minimum entropy regularizer minimizes the entropy of the hypothesis probability distribution which is output by the neural network. Experiments on the EMNIST-Letters dataset shows that my implementation of MIX-ENT and MIN-ENT lets the VGG model climb from its previous 3rd position on the paperswithcode leaderboard to reach the 2nd position on the leaderboard, outperforming the Spinal-VGG model in so doing. Specifically, using standard cross-entropy, VGG achieves 95.86% while Spinal-VGG achieves 95.88% classification accuracies, whereas using VGG (without Spinal-VGG) our MIN-ENT achieved 95.933%, while our MIX-ENT achieved 95.927% accuracies. The pre-trained models for both MIX-ENT and MIN-ENT are at https://github.com/rahmanoladi/minimum entropy project.

- **Summary**: We introduce YOLO11-JDE, a fast and accurate multi-object tracking (MOT) solution that combines real-time object detection with self-supervised Re-Identification (Re-ID). By incorporating a dedicated Re-ID branch into YOLO11s, our model performs Joint Detection and Embedding (JDE), generating appearance features for each detection. The Re-ID branch is trained in a fully self-supervised setting while simultaneously training for detection, eliminating the need for costly identity-labeled datasets. The triplet loss, with hard positive and semi-hard negative mining strategies, is used for learning discriminative embeddings. Data association is enhanced with a custom tracking implementation that successfully integrates motion, appearance, and location cues. YOLO11-JDE achieves competitive results on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks, surpassing existing JDE methods in terms of FPS and using up to ten times fewer parameters. Thus, making our method a highly attractive solution for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Skin diseases can arise from infections, allergies, genetic factors, autoimmune disorders, hormonal imbalances, or environmental triggers such as sun damage and pollution. Some skin diseases, such as Actinic Keratosis and Psoriasis, can be fatal if not treated in time. Early identification is crucial, but the diagnostic methods for these conditions are often expensive and not widely accessible. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient method for diagnosing skin diseases using deep learning techniques. This approach employs a modified VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model includes several convolutional layers and utilizes ImageNet weights with modified top layers. The top layer is updated with fully connected layers and a final softmax activation layer to classify skin diseases. The dataset used, titled "Skin Disease Dataset," is publicly available. While the VGG16 architecture does not include data augmentation by default, preprocessing techniques such as rotation, shifting, and zooming were applied to augment the data prior to model training. The proposed methodology achieved 90.67% accuracy using the modified VGG16 model, demonstrating its reliability in classifying skin diseases. The promising results highlight the potential of this approach for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: In image generation, Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models (MLVGMs) employ multiple latent variables to gradually shape the final images, from global characteristics to finer and local details (e.g., StyleGAN, NVAE), emerging as powerful tools for diverse applications. Yet their generative dynamics and latent variable utilization remain only empirically observed. In this work, we propose a novel framework to systematically quantify the impact of each latent variable in MLVGMs, using Mutual Information (MI) as a guiding metric. Our analysis reveals underutilized variables and can guide the use of MLVGMs in downstream applications.   With this foundation, we introduce a method for generating synthetic data for Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning (SSCRL). By leveraging the hierarchical and disentangled variables of MLVGMs, and guided by the previous analysis, we apply tailored latent perturbations to produce diverse views for SSCRL, without relying on real data altogether.   Additionally, we introduce a Continuous Sampling (CS) strategy, where the generator dynamically creates new samples during SSCRL training, greatly increasing data variability. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these contributions, showing that MLVGMs' generated views compete on par with or even surpass views generated from real data.   This work establishes a principled approach to understanding and exploiting MLVGMs, advancing both generative modeling and self-supervised learning.

- **Summary**: The in-situ detection of planetary, lunar, and small-body surface terrain is crucial for autonomous spacecraft applications, where learning-based computer vision methods are increasingly employed to enable intelligence without prior information or human intervention. However, many of these methods remain computationally expensive for spacecraft processors and prevent real-time operation. Training of such algorithms is additionally complex due to the scarcity of labeled data and reliance on supervised learning approaches. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a promising solution by facilitating model training with disparate data sources such as simulations or synthetic scenes, although UDA is difficult to apply to celestial environments where challenging feature spaces are paramount. To alleviate such issues, You Only Crash Once (YOCOv1) has studied the integration of Visual Similarity-based Alignment (VSA) into lightweight one-stage object detection architectures to improve space terrain UDA. Although proven effective, the approach faces notable limitations, including performance degradations in multi-class and high-altitude scenarios. Building upon the foundation of YOCOv1, we propose novel additions to the VSA scheme that enhance terrain detection capabilities under UDA, and our approach is evaluated across both simulated and real-world data. Our second YOCO rendition, YOCOv2, is capable of achieving state-of-the-art UDA performance on surface terrain detection, where we showcase improvements upwards of 31% compared with YOCOv1 and terrestrial state-of-the-art. We demonstrate the practical utility of YOCOv2 with spacecraft flight hardware performance benchmarking and qualitative evaluation of NASA mission data.

- **Summary**: Learned image compression (LIC) has demonstrated superior rate-distortion (R-D) performance compared to traditional codecs, but is challenged by training inefficiency that could incur more than two weeks to train a state-of-the-art model from scratch. Existing LIC methods overlook the slow convergence caused by compacting energy in learning nonlinear transforms. In this paper, we first reveal that such energy compaction consists of two components, i.e., feature decorrelation and uneven energy modulation. On such basis, we propose a linear auxiliary transform (AuxT) to disentangle energy compaction in training nonlinear transforms. The proposed AuxT obtains coarse approximation to achieve efficient energy compaction such that distribution fitting with the nonlinear transforms can be simplified to fine details. We then develop wavelet-based linear shortcuts (WLSs) for AuxT that leverages wavelet-based downsampling and orthogonal linear projection for feature decorrelation and subband-aware scaling for uneven energy modulation. AuxT is lightweight and plug-and-play to be integrated into diverse LIC models to address the slow convergence issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accelerate training of LIC models by 2 times and simultaneously achieves an average 1\% BD-rate reduction. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first successful attempt that can significantly improve the convergence of LIC with comparable or superior rate-distortion performance. Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/qingshi9974/AuxT}

- **Summary**: In real-world data, long-tailed data distribution is common, making it challenging for models trained on empirical risk minimisation to learn and classify tail classes effectively. While many studies have sought to improve long tail recognition by altering the data distribution in the feature space and adjusting model decision boundaries, research on the synergy and corrective approach among various methods is limited. Our study delves into three long-tail recognition techniques: Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL), Rare-Class Sample Generator (RSG), and Label-Distribution-Aware Margin Loss (LDAM). SCL enhances intra-class clusters based on feature similarity and promotes clear inter-class separability but tends to favour dominant classes only. When RSG is integrated into the model, we observed that the intra-class features further cluster towards the class centre, which demonstrates a synergistic effect together with SCL's principle of enhancing intra-class clustering. RSG generates new tail features and compensates for the tail feature space squeezed by SCL. Similarly, LDAM is known to introduce a larger margin specifically for tail classes; we demonstrate that LDAM further bolsters the model's performance on tail classes when combined with the more explicit decision boundaries achieved by SCL and RSG. Furthermore, SCL can compensate for the dominant class accuracy sacrificed by RSG and LDAM. Our research emphasises the synergy and balance among the three techniques, with each amplifying the strengths of the others and mitigating their shortcomings. Our experiment on long-tailed distribution datasets, using an end-to-end architecture, yields competitive results by enhancing tail class accuracy without compromising dominant class performance, achieving a balanced improvement across all classes.

- **Summary**: Existing zero-shot temporal action detection (ZSTAD) methods predominantly use fully supervised or unsupervised strategies to recognize unseen activities. However, these training-based methods are prone to domain shifts and require high computational costs, which hinder their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, unlike previous works, we propose a training-Free Zero-shot temporal Action Detection (FreeZAD) method, leveraging existing vision-language (ViL) models to directly classify and localize unseen activities within untrimmed videos without any additional fine-tuning or adaptation. We mitigate the need for explicit temporal modeling and reliance on pseudo-label quality by designing the LOGarithmic decay weighted Outer-Inner-Contrastive Score (LogOIC) and frequency-based Actionness Calibration. Furthermore, we introduce a test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy using Prototype-Centric Sampling (PCS) to expand FreeZAD, enabling ViL models to adapt more effectively for ZSTAD. Extensive experiments on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods while requiring only 1/13 of the runtime. When equipped with TTA, the enhanced method further narrows the gap with fully supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Considerable efforts have been made to improve monocular depth estimation under ideal conditions. However, in challenging environments, monocular depth estimation still faces difficulties. In this paper, we introduce visual prompt learning for predicting depth across different environments within a unified model, and present a self-supervised learning framework called PromptMono. It employs a set of learnable parameters as visual prompts to capture domain-specific knowledge. To integrate prompting information into image representations, a novel gated cross prompting attention (GCPA) module is proposed, which enhances the depth estimation in diverse conditions. We evaluate the proposed PromptMono on the Oxford Robotcar dataset and the nuScenes dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Recent advanced Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, such as the Apple Vision Pro, employ bottom-facing cameras to detect hand gestures and inputs, which offers users significant convenience in VR interactions. However, these bottom-facing cameras can sometimes be inconvenient and pose a risk of unintentionally exposing sensitive information, such as private body parts or personal surroundings. To mitigate these issues, we introduce EgoHand. This system provides an alternative solution by integrating millimeter-wave radar and IMUs for hand gesture recognition, thereby offering users an additional option for gesture interaction that enhances privacy protection. To accurately recognize hand gestures, we devise a two-stage skeleton-based gesture recognition scheme. In the first stage, a novel end-to-end Transformer architecture is employed to estimate the coordinates of hand joints. Subsequently, these estimated joint coordinates are utilized for gesture recognition. Extensive experiments involving 10 subjects show that EgoHand can detect hand gestures with 90.8% accuracy. Furthermore, EgoHand demonstrates robust performance across a variety of cross-domain tests, including different users, dominant hands, body postures, and scenes.

- **Summary**: We propose a new method for synthesizing an arbitrarily sized novel vector texture given a single raster exemplar. Our method first segments the exemplar to extract the primary textons, and then clusters them based on visual similarity. We then compute a descriptor to capture each texton's neighborhood which contains the inter-category relationships that are used at synthesis time. Next, we use a simple procedure to both extract and place the secondary textons behind the primary polygons. Finally, our method constructs a gradient field for the background which is defined by a set of data points and colors. The color of the secondary polygons are also adjusted to better match the gradient field. To compare our work with other methods, we use a wide range of perceptual-based metrics.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are increasingly employed in high-stakes medical applications, despite their tendency for shortcut learning in the presence of spurious correlations, which can have potentially fatal consequences in practice. Detecting and mitigating shortcut behavior is a challenging task that often requires significant labeling efforts from domain experts. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a semi-automated framework for the identification of spurious behavior from both data and model perspective by leveraging insights from eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). This allows the retrieval of spurious data points and the detection of model circuits that encode the associated prediction rules. Moreover, we demonstrate how these shortcut encodings can be used for XAI-based sample- and pixel-level data annotation, providing valuable information for bias mitigation methods to unlearn the undesired shortcut behavior. We show the applicability of our framework using four medical datasets across two modalities, featuring controlled and real-world spurious correlations caused by data artifacts. We successfully identify and mitigate these biases in VGG16, ResNet50, and contemporary Vision Transformer models, ultimately increasing their robustness and applicability for real-world medical tasks.

- **Summary**: Humans acquire knowledge through three cognitive stages: perceiving information, comprehending knowledge, and adapting knowledge to solve novel problems. Videos serve as an effective medium for this learning process, facilitating a progression through these cognitive stages. However, existing video benchmarks fail to systematically evaluate the knowledge acquisition capabilities in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). To address this gap, we introduce Video-MMMU, a multi-modal, multi-disciplinary benchmark designed to assess LMMs' ability to acquire and utilize knowledge from videos. Video-MMMU features a curated collection of 300 expert-level videos and 900 human-annotated questions across six disciplines, evaluating knowledge acquisition through stage-aligned question-answer pairs: Perception, Comprehension, and Adaptation. A proposed knowledge gain metric, {\Delta}knowledge, quantifies improvement in performance after video viewing. Evaluation of LMMs reveals a steep decline in performance as cognitive demands increase and highlights a significant gap between human and model knowledge acquisition, underscoring the need for methods to enhance LMMs' capability to learn and adapt from videos.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in multi-view action recognition have largely relied on Transformer-based models. While effective and adaptable, these models often require substantial computational resources, especially in scenarios with multiple views and multiple temporal sequences. Addressing this limitation, this paper introduces the MV-GMN model, a state-space model specifically designed to efficiently aggregate multi-modal data (RGB and skeleton), multi-view perspectives, and multi-temporal information for action recognition with reduced computational complexity. The MV-GMN model employs an innovative Multi-View Graph Mamba network comprising a series of MV-GMN blocks. Each block includes a proposed Bidirectional State Space Block and a GCN module. The Bidirectional State Space Block introduces four scanning strategies, including view-prioritized and time-prioritized approaches. The GCN module leverages rule-based and KNN-based methods to construct the graph network, effectively integrating features from different viewpoints and temporal instances. Demonstrating its efficacy, MV-GMN outperforms the state-of-the-arts on several datasets, achieving notable accuracies of 97.3\% and 96.7\% on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset in cross-subject and cross-view scenarios, respectively. MV-GMN also surpasses Transformer-based baselines while requiring only linear inference complexity, underscoring the model's ability to reduce computational load and enhance the scalability and applicability of multi-view action recognition technologies.

- **Summary**: Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles and reducing traffic fatalities involving pedestrians. While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.

- **Summary**: Current disposal facilities for coarse-grained waste perform manual sorting of materials with heavy machinery. Large quantities of recyclable materials are lost to coarse waste, so more effective sorting processes must be developed to recover them. Two key aspects to automate the sorting process are object detection with material classification in mixed piles of waste, and autonomous control of hydraulic machinery. Because most objects in those accumulations of waste are damaged or destroyed, object detection alone is not feasible in the majority of cases. To address these challenges, we propose a classification of materials with multispectral images of ultraviolet (UV), visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectrums. Solution for autonomous control of hydraulic heavy machines for sorting of bulky waste is being investigated using cost-effective cameras and artificial intelligence-based controllers.

- **Summary**: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel compositions of attributes and objects by leveraging knowledge learned from seen compositions. Recent approaches have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align textual and visual modalities. These methods typically employ prompt engineering, parameter-tuning, and modality fusion to generate rich textual prototypes that serve as class prototypes for CZSL. However, the modality gap results in textual prototypes being unable to fully capture the optimal representations of all class prototypes, particularly those with fine-grained features, which can be directly obtained from the visual modality. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Prototype Joint Learning framework for the CZSL task. Our approach, based on VLMs, introduces prototypes in both the textual and visual modalities. The textual prototype is optimized to capture broad conceptual information, aiding the model's generalization across unseen compositions. Meanwhile, the visual prototype is used to mitigate the classification errors caused by the modality gap and capture fine-grained details to distinguish images with similar appearances. To effectively optimize these prototypes, we design specialized decomposition modules and a joint learning strategy that enrich the features from both modalities. These prototypes not only capture key category information during training but also serve as crucial reference targets during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the closed-world setting and competitive performance in the open-world setting across three publicly available CZSL benchmarks. These findings validate the effectiveness of our method in advancing compositional generalization.

- **Summary**: Advanced multimodal AI agents can now collaborate with users to solve challenges in the world. We explore eye tracking's role in such interaction to convey a user's attention relative to the physical environment. We hypothesize that this knowledge improves contextual understanding for AI agents. By observing hours of human-object interactions, we first measure the relationship between an eye tracker's signal quality and its ability to reliably place gaze on nearby physical objects. We then conduct experiments which relay the user's scanpath history as additional context querying multimodal agents. Our results show that eye tracking provides high value as a user attention signal and can convey information about the user's current task and interests to the agent.

- **Summary**: Lower-Limb Fractures (LLF) are a major health concern for older adults, often leading to reduced mobility and prolonged recovery, potentially impairing daily activities and independence. During recovery, older adults frequently face social isolation and functional decline, complicating rehabilitation and adversely affecting physical and mental health. Multi-modal sensor platforms that continuously collect data and analyze it using machine-learning algorithms can remotely monitor this population and infer health outcomes. They can also alert clinicians to individuals at risk of isolation and decline. This paper presents a new publicly available multi-modal sensor dataset, MAISON-LLF, collected from older adults recovering from LLF in community settings. The dataset includes data from smartphone and smartwatch sensors, motion detectors, sleep-tracking mattresses, and clinical questionnaires on isolation and decline. The dataset was collected from ten older adults living alone at home for eight weeks each, totaling 560 days of 24-hour sensor data. For technical validation, supervised machine-learning and deep-learning models were developed using the sensor and clinical questionnaire data, providing a foundational comparison for the research community.

- **Summary**: We propose a trait-specific image generation method that models forehead creases geometrically using B-spline and B\'ezier curves. This approach ensures the realistic generation of both principal creases and non-prominent crease patterns, effectively constructing detailed and authentic forehead-crease images. These geometrically rendered images serve as visual prompts for a diffusion-based Edge-to-Image translation model, which generates corresponding mated samples. The resulting novel synthetic identities are then used to train a forehead-crease verification network. To enhance intra-subject diversity in the generated samples, we employ two strategies: (a) perturbing the control points of B-splines under defined constraints to maintain label consistency, and (b) applying image-level augmentations to the geometric visual prompts, such as dropout and elastic transformations, specifically tailored to crease patterns. By integrating the proposed synthetic dataset with real-world data, our method significantly improves the performance of forehead-crease verification systems under a cross-database verification protocol.

- **Summary**: We present Pix2Cap-COCO, the first panoptic pixel-level caption dataset designed to advance fine-grained visual understanding. To achieve this, we carefully design an automated annotation pipeline that prompts GPT-4V to generate pixel-aligned, instance-specific captions for individual objects within images, enabling models to learn more granular relationships between objects and their contexts. This approach results in 167,254 detailed captions, with an average of 22.94 words per caption. Building on Pix2Cap-COCO, we introduce a novel task, panoptic segmentation-captioning, which challenges models to recognize instances in an image and provide detailed descriptions for each simultaneously. To benchmark this task, we design a robust baseline based on X-Decoder. The experimental results demonstrate that Pix2Cap-COCO is a particularly challenging dataset, as it requires models to excel in both fine-grained visual understanding and detailed language generation. Furthermore, we leverage Pix2Cap-COCO for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on large multimodal models (LMMs) to enhance their performance. For example, training with Pix2Cap-COCO significantly improves the performance of GPT4RoI, yielding gains in CIDEr +1.4%, ROUGE +0.4%, and SPICE +0.5% on Visual Genome dataset, and strengthens its region understanding ability on the ViP-BENCH, with an overall improvement of +5.1%, including notable increases in recognition accuracy +11.2% and language generation quality +22.2%.

- **Summary**: Graphical User Interface (GUI) action grounding is a critical step in GUI automation that maps language instructions to actionable elements on GUI screens. Most recent works of GUI action grounding leverage large GUI datasets to fine-tune MLLMs. However, the fine-tuning data always covers limited GUI environments, and we find the performance of the resulting model deteriorates in novel environments. We argue that the GUI grounding models should be further aligned to the novel environments to reveal their full potential, when the inference is known to involve novel environments, i.e., environments not used during the previous fine-tuning. To realize this, we first propose GUI-Bee, an MLLM-based autonomous agent, to collect high-quality, environment-specific data through exploration and then continuously fine-tune GUI grounding models with the collected data. Our agent leverages a novel Q-value-Incentive In-Context Reinforcement Learning (Q-ICRL) method to optimize exploration efficiency and data quality. Additionally, we introduce NovelScreenSpot, a benchmark for testing how well the data can help align GUI action grounding models to novel environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of data collected by GUI-Bee in the experiments. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to validate the Q-ICRL method in enhancing the efficiency of GUI-Bee. Project page: https://gui-bee.github.io

- **Summary**: With the growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent studies on point-supervised OOD have attracted significant interest. In this paper, we propose PointOBB-v3, a stronger single point-supervised OOD framework. Compared to existing methods, it generates pseudo rotated boxes without additional priors and incorporates support for the end-to-end paradigm. PointOBB-v3 functions by integrating three unique image views: the original view, a resized view, and a rotated/flipped (rot/flp) view. Based on the views, a scale augmentation module and an angle acquisition module are constructed. In the first module, a Scale-Sensitive Consistency (SSC) loss and a Scale-Sensitive Feature Fusion (SSFF) module are introduced to improve the model's ability to estimate object scale. To achieve precise angle predictions, the second module employs symmetry-based self-supervised learning. Additionally, we introduce an end-to-end version that eliminates the pseudo-label generation process by integrating a detector branch and introduces an Instance-Aware Weighting (IAW) strategy to focus on high-quality predictions. We conducted extensive experiments on the DIOR-R, DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0, FAIR1M, STAR, and RSAR datasets. Across all these datasets, our method achieves an average improvement in accuracy of 3.56% in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We introduce the Binary Diffusion Probabilistic Model (BDPM), a novel generative model optimized for binary data representations. While denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated notable success in tasks like image synthesis and restoration, traditional DDPMs rely on continuous data representations and mean squared error (MSE) loss for training, applying Gaussian noise models that may not be optimal for discrete or binary data structures. BDPM addresses this by decomposing images into bitplanes and employing XOR-based noise transformations, with a denoising model trained using binary cross-entropy loss. This approach enables precise noise control and computationally efficient inference, significantly lowering computational costs and improving model convergence. When evaluated on image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, inpainting, and blind image restoration, BDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ datasets. Notably, BDPM requires fewer inference steps than traditional DDPM models to reach optimal results, showcasing enhanced inference efficiency.

- **Summary**: Video generation has achieved significant advances through rectified flow techniques, but issues like unsmooth motion and misalignment between videos and prompts persist. In this work, we develop a systematic pipeline that harnesses human feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation model. Specifically, we begin by constructing a large-scale human preference dataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise annotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, a multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models by extending those from diffusion models. These include two training-time strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom weights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video quality needs. Project page: https://gongyeliu.github.io/videoalign.

- **Summary**: Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of diffusion models, text-to-image(T2I) models have made significant progress, showcasing impressive abilities in prompt following and image generation. Recently launched models such as FLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0, along with others like Dall-E3 and Stable Diffusion 3, have demonstrated exceptional performance across various complex tasks, raising questions about whether T2I models are moving towards general-purpose applicability. Beyond traditional image generation, these models exhibit capabilities across a range of fields, including controllable generation, image editing, video, audio, 3D, and motion generation, as well as computer vision tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation. However, current evaluation frameworks are insufficient to comprehensively assess these models' performance across expanding domains. To thoroughly evaluate these models, we developed the IMAGINE-E and tested six prominent models: FLUX.1, Ideogram2.0, Midjourney, Dall-E3, Stable Diffusion 3, and Jimeng. Our evaluation is divided into five key domains: structured output generation, realism, and physical consistency, specific domain generation, challenging scenario generation, and multi-style creation tasks. This comprehensive assessment highlights each model's strengths and limitations, particularly the outstanding performance of FLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0 in structured and specific domain tasks, underscoring the expanding applications and potential of T2I models as foundational AI tools. This study provides valuable insights into the current state and future trajectory of T2I models as they evolve towards general-purpose usability.

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has demonstrated significant potential in addressing distribution shifts between training and testing data. Open-set test-time adaptation (OSTTA) aims to adapt a source pre-trained model online to an unlabeled target domain that contains unknown classes. This task becomes more challenging when multiple modalities are involved. Existing methods have primarily focused on unimodal OSTTA, often filtering out low-confidence samples without addressing the complexities of multimodal data. In this work, we present Adaptive Entropy-aware Optimization (AEO), a novel framework specifically designed to tackle Multimodal Open-set Test-time Adaptation (MM-OSTTA) for the first time. Our analysis shows that the entropy difference between known and unknown samples in the target domain strongly correlates with MM-OSTTA performance. To leverage this, we propose two key components: Unknown-aware Adaptive Entropy Optimization (UAE) and Adaptive Modality Prediction Discrepancy Optimization (AMP). These components enhance the ability of model to distinguish unknown class samples during online adaptation by amplifying the entropy difference between known and unknown samples. To thoroughly evaluate our proposed methods in the MM-OSTTA setting, we establish a new benchmark derived from existing datasets. This benchmark includes two downstream tasks and incorporates five modalities. Extensive experiments across various domain shift situations demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of the AEO framework. Additionally, we highlight the strong performance of AEO in long-term and continual MM-OSTTA settings, both of which are challenging and highly relevant to real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have recognized fine-grained grounding as an imperative factor of visual understanding and dialogue. However, the benefits of such representation in LMMs are limited to the natural image domain, and these models perform poorly for remote sensing (RS). The distinct overhead viewpoint, scale variation, and presence of small objects in high-resolution RS imagery present a unique challenge in region-level comprehension. Moreover, the development of the grounding conversation capability of LMMs within RS is hindered by the lack of granular, RS domain-specific grounded data. Addressing these limitations, we propose GeoPixel - the first end-to-end high resolution RS-LMM that supports pixel-level grounding. This capability allows fine-grained visual perception by generating interleaved masks in conversation. GeoPixel supports up to 4K HD resolution in any aspect ratio, ideal for high-precision RS image analysis. To support the grounded conversation generation (GCG) in RS imagery, we curate a visually grounded dataset GeoPixelD through a semi-automated pipeline that utilizes set-of-marks prompting and spatial priors tailored for RS data to methodically control the data generation process. GeoPixel demonstrates superior performance in pixel-level comprehension, surpassing existing LMMs in both single-target and multi-target segmentation tasks. Our methodological ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in the overall architecture. Our code and data will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been extensively explored in large models to tackle complex understanding tasks. However, it still remains an open question whether such strategies can be applied to verifying and reinforcing image generation scenarios. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. We focus on three techniques: scaling test-time computation for verification, aligning model preferences with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and integrating these techniques for complementary effects. Our results demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to significantly improve image generation performance. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the Potential Assessment Reward Model (PARM) and PARM++, specialized for autoregressive image generation. PARM adaptively assesses each generation step through a potential assessment approach, merging the strengths of existing reward models, and PARM++ further introduces a reflection mechanism to self-correct the generated unsatisfactory image. Using our investigated reasoning strategies, we enhance a baseline model, Show-o, to achieve superior results, with a significant +24% improvement on the GenEval benchmark, surpassing Stable Diffusion 3 by +15%. We hope our study provides unique insights and paves a new path for integrating CoT reasoning with autoregressive image generation.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in natural language processing tasks, but their application to machine translation (MT) remains challenging due to pretraining on English-centric data and the complexity of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simpler and more efficient alternative, but its performance depends heavily on the quality of preference data. To address this, we propose Confidence-Reward driven Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel method that combines reward scores with model confidence to improve data selection for fine-tuning. CRPO selects challenging sentence pairs where the model is uncertain or underperforms, leading to more effective learning. While primarily designed for LLMs, CRPO also generalizes to encoder-decoder models like NLLB, demonstrating its versatility. Empirical results show that CRPO outperforms existing methods such as RS-DPO, RSO and MBR score in both translation accuracy and data efficiency.

- **Summary**: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications requiring accurate and scalable representations across diverse perspectives. Current leading methods such as DUSt3R employ a fundamentally pairwise approach, processing images in pairs and necessitating costly global alignment procedures to reconstruct from multiple views. In this work, we propose Fast 3D Reconstruction (Fast3R), a novel multi-view generalization to DUSt3R that achieves efficient and scalable 3D reconstruction by processing many views in parallel. Fast3R's Transformer-based architecture forwards N images in a single forward pass, bypassing the need for iterative alignment. Through extensive experiments on camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction, Fast3R demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in inference speed and reduced error accumulation. These results establish Fast3R as a robust alternative for multi-view applications, offering enhanced scalability without compromising reconstruction accuracy.
