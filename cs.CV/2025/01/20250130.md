- **Summary**: We present MILS: Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver, a surprisingly simple, training-free approach, to imbue multimodal capabilities into your favorite LLM. Leveraging their innate ability to perform multi-step reasoning, MILS prompts the LLM to generate candidate outputs, each of which are scored and fed back iteratively, eventually generating a solution to the task. This enables various applications that typically require training specialized models on task-specific data. In particular, we establish a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot image, video and audio captioning. MILS seamlessly applies to media generation as well, discovering prompt rewrites to improve text-to-image generation, and even edit prompts for style transfer! Finally, being a gradient-free optimization approach, MILS can invert multimodal embeddings into text, enabling applications like cross-modal arithmetic.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art machine learning systems are vulnerable to small perturbations to their input, where ``small'' is defined according to a threat model that assigns a positive threat to each perturbation. Most prior works define a task-agnostic, isotropic, and global threat, like the $\ell_p$ norm, where the magnitude of the perturbation fully determines the degree of the threat and neither the direction of the attack nor its position in space matter. However, common corruptions in computer vision, such as blur, compression, or occlusions, are not well captured by such threat models. This paper proposes a novel threat model called \texttt{Projected Displacement} (PD) to study robustness beyond existing isotropic and global threat models. The proposed threat model measures the threat of a perturbation via its alignment with \textit{unsafe directions}, defined as directions in the input space along which a perturbation of sufficient magnitude changes the ground truth class label. Unsafe directions are identified locally for each input based on observed training data. In this way, the PD threat model exhibits anisotropy and locality. Experiments on Imagenet-1k data indicate that, for any input, the set of perturbations with small PD threat includes \textit{safe} perturbations of large $\ell_p$ norm that preserve the true label, such as noise, blur and compression, while simultaneously excluding \textit{unsafe} perturbations that alter the true label. Unlike perceptual threat models based on embeddings of large-vision models, the PD threat model can be readily computed for arbitrary classification tasks without pre-training or finetuning. Further additional task annotation such as sensitivity to image regions or concept hierarchies can be easily integrated into the assessment of threat and thus the PD threat model presents practitioners with a flexible, task-driven threat specification.

- **Summary**: Purpose: This study examines the core traits of image-to-image translation (I2I) networks, focusing on their effectiveness and adaptability in everyday clinical settings. Methods: We have analyzed data from 794 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa), using ten prominent 2D/3D I2I networks to convert ultrasound (US) images into MRI scans. We also introduced a new analysis of Radiomic features (RF) via the Spearman correlation coefficient to explore whether networks with high performance (SSIM>85%) could detect subtle RFs. Our study further examined synthetic images by 7 invited physicians. As a final evaluation study, we have investigated the improvement that are achieved using the synthetic MRI data on two traditional machine learning and one deep learning method. Results: In quantitative assessment, 2D-Pix2Pix network substantially outperformed the other 7 networks, with an average SSIM~0.855. The RF analysis revealed that 76 out of 186 RFs were identified using the 2D-Pix2Pix algorithm alone, although half of the RFs were lost during the translation process. A detailed qualitative review by 7 medical doctors noted a deficiency in low-level feature recognition in I2I tasks. Furthermore, the study found that synthesized image-based classification outperformed US image-based classification with an average accuracy and AUC~0.93. Conclusion: This study showed that while 2D-Pix2Pix outperformed cutting-edge networks in low-level feature discovery and overall error and similarity metrics, it still requires improvement in low-level feature performance, as highlighted by Group 3. Further, the study found using synthetic image-based classification outperformed original US image-based methods.

- **Summary**: We propose a lifelong 3D mapping framework that is modular, cloud-native by design and more importantly, works for both hand-held and robot-mounted 3D LiDAR mapping systems. Our proposed framework comprises of dynamic point removal, multi-session map alignment, map change detection and map version control. First, our sensor-setup agnostic dynamic point removal algorithm works seamlessly with both hand-held and robot-mounted setups to produce clean static 3D maps. Second, the multi-session map alignment aligns these clean static maps automatically, without manual parameter fine-tuning, into a single reference frame, using a two stage approach based on feature descriptor matching and fine registration. Third, our novel map change detection identifies positive and negative changes between two aligned maps. Finally, the map version control maintains a single base map that represents the current state of the environment, and stores the detected positive and negative changes, and boundary information. Our unique map version control system can reconstruct any of the previous clean session maps and allows users to query changes between any two random mapping sessions, all without storing any input raw session maps, making it very unique. Extensive experiments are performed using hand-held commercial LiDAR mapping devices and open-source robot-mounted LiDAR SLAM algorithms to evaluate each module and the whole 3D lifelong mapping framework.

- **Summary**: Functional data analysis (FDA) is essential for analyzing continuous, high-dimensional data, yet existing methods often decouple functional registration and classification, limiting their efficiency and performance. We present DeepFRC, an end-to-end deep learning framework that unifies these tasks within a single model. Our approach incorporates an alignment module that learns time warping functions via elastic function registration and a learnable basis representation module for dimensionality reduction on aligned data. This integration enhances both alignment accuracy and predictive performance. Theoretical analysis establishes that DeepFRC achieves low misalignment and generalization error, while simulations elucidate the progression of registration, reconstruction, and classification during training. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DeepFRC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in addressing complex registration challenges.

- **Summary**: Real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope is a significant task for efficient navigation and robotic automation of endoscopy. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to perform real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope. Firstly, a multi-modal visual feature learning network is proposed to perform relative pose prediction, in which the motion feature from the optical flow, the scene features and the joint feature from two adjacent observations are all extracted for prediction. Due to more correlation information in the channel dimension of the concatenated image, a novel feature extractor is designed based on an attention mechanism to integrate multi-dimensional information from the concatenation of two continuous frames. To extract more complete feature representation from the fused features, a novel pose decoder is proposed to predict the pose transformation from the concatenated feature map at the end of the framework. At last, the absolute pose of endoscope is calculated based on relative poses. The experiment is conducted on three datasets of various endoscopic scenes and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the inference speed of the proposed method is over 30 frames per second, which meets the real-time requirement.

- **Summary**: Building reliable speech systems often requires combining multiple modalities, like audio and visual cues. While such multimodal solutions frequently lead to improvements in performance and may even be critical in certain cases, they come with several constraints such as increased sensory requirements, computational cost, and modality synchronization, to mention a few. These challenges constrain the direct uses of these multimodal solutions in real-world applications. In this work, we develop approaches where the learning happens with all available modalities but the deployment or inference is done with just one or reduced modalities. To do so, we propose a Multimodal Training and Unimodal Deployment (MUTUD) framework which includes a Temporally Aligned Modality feature Estimation (TAME) module that can estimate information from missing modality using modalities present during inference. This innovative approach facilitates the integration of information across different modalities, enhancing the overall inference process by leveraging the strengths of each modality to compensate for the absence of certain modalities during inference. We apply MUTUD to various audiovisual speech tasks and show that it can reduce the performance gap between the multimodal and corresponding unimodal models to a considerable extent. MUTUD can achieve this while reducing the model size and compute compared to multimodal models, in some cases by almost 80%.

- **Summary**: With over 2 million new cases identified annually, skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer globally and the second most common in Bangladesh, following breast cancer. Early detection and treatment are crucial for enhancing patient outcomes; however, Bangladesh faces a shortage of dermatologists and qualified medical professionals capable of diagnosing and treating skin cancer. As a result, many cases are diagnosed only at advanced stages. Research indicates that deep learning algorithms can effectively classify skin cancer images. However, these models typically lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand their decision-making processes. This lack of clarity poses barriers to utilizing deep learning in improving skin cancer detection and treatment. In this article, we present a method aimed at enhancing the interpretability of deep learning models for skin cancer classification in Bangladesh. Our technique employs a combination of saliency maps and attention maps to visualize critical features influencing the model's diagnoses.

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, The perception capabilities of the ego-vehicle can be improved with roadside sensors, which can provide a holistic view of the environment. However, existing monocular detection methods designed for vehicle cameras are not suitable for roadside cameras due to viewpoint domain gaps. To bridge this gap and Improve ROAdside Monocular 3D object detection, we propose IROAM, a semantic-geometry decoupled contrastive learning framework, which takes vehicle-side and roadside data as input simultaneously. IROAM has two significant modules. In-Domain Query Interaction module utilizes a transformer to learn content and depth information for each domain and outputs object queries. Cross-Domain Query Enhancement To learn better feature representations from two domains, Cross-Domain Query Enhancement decouples queries into semantic and geometry parts and only the former is used for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IROAM in improving roadside detector's performance. The results validate that IROAM has the capabilities to learn cross-domain information.

- **Summary**: Early diagnosis and noninvasive monitoring of neurological disorders require sensitivity to elusive cellular-level alterations that occur much earlier than volumetric changes observable with the millimeter-resolution of medical imaging modalities. Morphological changes in axons, such as axonal varicosities or beadings, are observed in neurological disorders, as well as in development and aging. Here, we reveal the sensitivity of time-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) to axonal morphology at the micrometer scale. Scattering theory uncovers the two parameters that determine the diffusive dynamics of water in axons: the average reciprocal cross-section and the variance of long-range cross-sectional fluctuations. This theoretical development allowed us to predict dMRI metrics sensitive to axonal alterations across tens of thousands of axons in seconds rather than months of simulations in a rat model of traumatic brain injury. Our approach bridges the gap between micrometers and millimeters in resolution, offering quantitative, objective biomarkers applicable to a broad spectrum of neurological disorders.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the very first attempt to evaluate machine learning fairness for depression detection using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. We conduct experiments using different deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks across three EEG datasets: Mumtaz, MODMA and Rest. We employ five different bias mitigation strategies at the pre-, in- and post-processing stages and evaluate their effectiveness. Our experimental results show that bias exists in existing EEG datasets and algorithms for depression detection, and different bias mitigation methods address bias at different levels across different fairness measures.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we revisit a supervised learning approach based on unrolling, known as $\Psi$DONet, by providing a deeper microlocal interpretation for its theoretical analysis, and extending its study to the case of sparse-angle tomography. Furthermore, we refine the implementation of the original $\Psi$DONet considering special filters whose structure is specifically inspired by the streak artifact singularities characterizing tomographic reconstructions from incomplete data. This allows to considerably lower the number of (learnable) parameters while preserving (or even slightly improving) the same quality for the reconstructions from limited-angle data and providing a proof-of-concept for the case of sparse-angle tomographic data.

- **Summary**: Rapid progress in text-to-motion generation has been largely driven by diffusion models. However, existing methods focus solely on temporal modeling, thereby overlooking frequency-domain analysis. We identify two key phases in motion denoising: the **semantic planning stage** and the **fine-grained improving stage**. To address these phases effectively, we propose **Fre**quency **e**nhanced **t**ext-**to**-**m**otion diffusion model (**Free-T2M**), incorporating stage-specific consistency losses that enhance the robustness of static features and improve fine-grained accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, on StableMoFusion, our method reduces the FID from **0.189** to **0.051**, establishing a new SOTA performance within the diffusion architecture. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating frequency-domain insights into text-to-motion generation for more precise and robust results.

- **Summary**: A patient undergoes multiple examinations in each hospital stay, where each provides different facets of the health status. These assessments include temporal data with varying sampling rates, discrete single-point measurements, therapeutic interventions such as medication administration, and images. While physicians are able to process and integrate diverse modalities intuitively, neural networks need specific modeling for each modality complicating the training procedure. We demonstrate that this complexity can be significantly reduced by visualizing all information as images along with unstructured text and subsequently training a conventional vision-text transformer. Our approach, Vision Transformer for irregular sampled Multi-modal Measurements (ViTiMM), not only simplifies data preprocessing and modeling but also outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in predicting in-hospital mortality and phenotyping, as evaluated on 6,175 patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The modalities include patient's clinical measurements, medications, X-ray images, and electrocardiography scans. We hope our work inspires advancements in multi-modal medical AI by reducing the training complexity to (visual) prompt engineering, thus lowering entry barriers and enabling no-code solutions for training. The source code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an analysis of utilizing elevation data to aid outdoor point cloud semantic segmentation through existing machine-learning networks in remote sensing, specifically in urban, built-up areas. In dense outdoor point clouds, the receptive field of a machine learning model may be too small to accurately determine the surroundings and context of a point. By computing Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from the point clouds, we extract the relative elevation feature, which is the vertical distance from the terrain to a point. RandLA-Net is employed for efficient semantic segmentation of large-scale point clouds. We assess its performance across three diverse outdoor datasets captured with varying sensor technologies and sensor locations. Integration of relative elevation data leads to consistent performance improvements across all three datasets, most notably in the Hessigheim dataset, with an increase of 3.7 percentage points in average F1 score from 72.35% to 76.01%, by establishing long-range dependencies between ground and objects. We also explore additional local features such as planarity, normal vectors, and 2D features, but their efficacy varied based on the characteristics of the point cloud. Ultimately, this study underscores the important role of the non-local relative elevation feature for semantic segmentation of point clouds in remote sensing applications.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal transformers are rapidly gaining attention in video captioning tasks. Existing multi-modal video captioning methods typically extract a fixed number of frames, which raises critical challenges. When a limited number of frames are extracted, important frames with essential information for caption generation may be missed. Conversely, extracting an excessive number of frames includes consecutive frames, potentially causing redundancy in visual tokens extracted from consecutive video frames. To extract an appropriate number of frames for each video, this paper proposes the first model-agnostic module selection framework in video captioning that has two main functions: (1) selecting a caption generation module with an appropriate size based on visual tokens extracted from video frames, and (2) constructing subsets of visual tokens for the selected caption generation module. Furthermore, we propose a new adaptive attention masking scheme that enhances attention on important visual tokens. Our experiments on three different benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the performance of three recent video captioning models.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence has significantly advanced skin cancer diagnosis by enabling rapid and accurate detection of malignant lesions. In this domain, most publicly available image datasets consist of single, isolated skin lesions positioned at the center of the image. While these lesion-centric datasets have been fundamental for developing diagnostic algorithms, they lack the context of the surrounding skin, which is critical for improving lesion detection. The iToBoS dataset was created to address this challenge. It includes 16,954 images of skin regions from 100 participants, captured using 3D total body photography. Each image roughly corresponds to a $7 \times 9$ cm section of skin with all suspicious lesions annotated using bounding boxes. Additionally, the dataset provides metadata such as anatomical location, age group, and sun damage score for each image. This dataset aims to facilitate training and benchmarking of algorithms, with the goal of enabling early detection of skin cancer and deployment of this technology in non-clinical environments.

- **Summary**: Lung cancer is a major issue in worldwide public health, requiring early diagnosis using stable techniques. This work begins a thorough investigation of the use of machine learning (ML) methods for precise classification of lung cancer stages. A cautious analysis is performed to overcome overfitting issues in model performance, taking into account minimum child weight and learning rate. A set of machine learning (ML) models including XGBoost (XGB), LGBM, Adaboost, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), CatBoost, and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) are run methodically and contrasted. Furthermore, the correlation between features and targets is examined using the deep neural network (DNN) model and thus their capability in detecting complex patternsis established. It is argued that several ML models can be capable of classifying lung cancer stages with great accuracy. In spite of the complexity of DNN architectures, traditional ML models like XGBoost, LGBM, and Logistic Regression excel with superior performance. The models perform better than the others in lung cancer prediction on the complete set of comparative metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score

- **Summary**: Machine learning offers attractive solutions to challenging image processing tasks. Tedious development and parametrization of algorithmic solutions can be replaced by training a convolutional neural network or a random forest with a high potential to generalize. However, machine learning methods rely on huge amounts of representative image data along with a ground truth, usually obtained by manual annotation. Thus, limited availability of training data is a critical bottleneck. We discuss two use cases: optical quality control in industrial production and segmenting crack structures in 3D images of concrete. For optical quality control, all defect types have to be trained but are typically not evenly represented in the training data. Additionally, manual annotation is costly and often inconsistent. It is nearly impossible in the second case: segmentation of crack systems in 3D images of concrete. Synthetic images, generated based on realizations of stochastic geometry models, offer an elegant way out. A wide variety of structure types can be generated. The within structure variation is naturally captured by the stochastic nature of the models and the ground truth is for free. Many new questions arise. In particular, which characteristics of the real image data have to be met to which degree of fidelity.

- **Summary**: Many video-to-audio (VTA) methods have been proposed for dubbing silent AI-generated videos. An efficient quality assessment method for AI-generated audio-visual content (AGAV) is crucial for ensuring audio-visual quality. Existing audio-visual quality assessment methods struggle with unique distortions in AGAVs, such as unrealistic and inconsistent elements. To address this, we introduce AGAVQA, the first large-scale AGAV quality assessment dataset, comprising 3,382 AGAVs from 16 VTA methods. AGAVQA includes two subsets: AGAVQA-MOS, which provides multi-dimensional scores for audio quality, content consistency, and overall quality, and AGAVQA-Pair, designed for optimal AGAV pair selection. We further propose AGAV-Rater, a LMM-based model that can score AGAVs, as well as audio and music generated from text, across multiple dimensions, and selects the best AGAV generated by VTA methods to present to the user. AGAV-Rater achieves state-of-the-art performance on AGAVQA, Text-to-Audio, and Text-to-Music datasets. Subjective tests also confirm that AGAV-Rater enhances VTA performance and user experience.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a CAD-based approach for automated surface defect detection. We leverage the a-priori knowledge embedded in a CAD model and integrate it with point cloud data acquired from commercially available stereo and depth cameras. The proposed method first transforms the CAD model into a high-density polygonal mesh, where each vertex represents a state variable in 3D space. Subsequently, a weighted least squares algorithm is employed to iteratively estimate the state of the scanned workpiece based on the captured point cloud measurements. This framework offers the potential to incorporate information from diverse sensors into the CAD domain, facilitating a more comprehensive analysis. Preliminary results demonstrate promising performance, with the algorithm achieving convergence to a sub-millimeter standard deviation in the region of interest using only approximately 50 point cloud samples. This highlights the potential of utilising commercially available stereo cameras for high-precision quality control applications.

- **Summary**: This paper presents VDAct, a dataset for a Video-grounded Dialogue on Event-driven Activities, alongside VDEval, a session-based context evaluation metric specially designed for the task. Unlike existing datasets, VDAct includes longer and more complex video sequences that depict a variety of event-driven activities that require advanced contextual understanding for accurate response generation. The dataset comprises 3,000 dialogues with over 30,000 question-and-answer pairs, derived from 1,000 videos with diverse activity scenarios. VDAct displays a notably challenging characteristic due to its broad spectrum of activity scenarios and wide range of question types. Empirical studies on state-of-the-art vision foundation models highlight their limitations in addressing certain question types on our dataset. Furthermore, VDEval, which integrates dialogue session history and video content summaries extracted from our supplementary Knowledge Graphs to evaluate individual responses, demonstrates a significantly higher correlation with human assessments on the VDAct dataset than existing evaluation metrics that rely solely on the context of single dialogue turns.

- **Summary**: MRI imputation aims to synthesize the missing modality from one or more available ones, which is highly desirable since it reduces scanning costs and delivers comprehensive MRI information to enhance clinical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a unified model, CodeBrain, designed to adapt to various brain MRI imputation scenarios. The core design lies in casting various inter-modality transformations as a full-modality code prediction task. To this end, CodeBrain is trained in two stages: Reconstruction and Code Prediction. First, in the Reconstruction stage, we reconstruct each MRI modality, which is mapped into a shared latent space followed by a scalar quantization. Since such quantization is lossy and the code is low dimensional, another MRI modality belonging to the same subject is randomly selected to generate common features to supplement the code and boost the target reconstruction. In the second stage, we train another encoder by a customized grading loss to predict the full-modality codes from randomly masked MRI samples, supervised by the corresponding quantized codes generated from the first stage. In this way, the inter-modality transformation is achieved by mapping the instance-specific codes in a finite scalar space. We evaluated the proposed CodeBrain model on two public brain MRI datasets (i.e., IXI and BraTS 2023). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CodeBrain model achieves superior imputation performance compared to four existing methods, establishing a new state of the art for unified brain MRI imputation. Codes will be released.

- **Summary**: Automated tracking of surgical tool keypoints in robotic surgery videos is an essential task for various downstream use cases such as skill assessment, expertise assessment, and the delineation of safety zones. In recent years, the explosion of deep learning for vision applications has led to many works in surgical instrument segmentation, while lesser focus has been on tracking specific tool keypoints, such as tool tips. In this work, we propose a novel, multi-frame context-driven deep learning framework to localize and track tool keypoints in surgical videos. We train and test our models on the annotated frames from the 2015 EndoVis Challenge dataset, resulting in state-of-the-art performance. By leveraging sophisticated deep learning models and multi-frame context, we achieve 90\% keypoint detection accuracy and a localization RMS error of 5.27 pixels. Results on a self-annotated JIGSAWS dataset with more challenging scenarios also show that the proposed multi-frame models can accurately track tool-tip and tool-base keypoints, with ${<}4.2$-pixel RMS error overall. Such a framework paves the way for accurately tracking surgical instrument keypoints, enabling further downstream use cases. Project and dataset webpage: https://tinyurl.com/mfc-tracker

- **Summary**: We introduce MedXpertQA, a highly challenging and comprehensive benchmark to evaluate expert-level medical knowledge and advanced reasoning. MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 16 leading models on MedXpertQA. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models.

- **Summary**: Finding and properly segmenting cracks in images of concrete is a challenging task. Cracks are thin and rough and being air filled do yield a very weak contrast in 3D images obtained by computed tomography. Enhancing and segmenting dark lower-dimensional structures is already demanding. The heterogeneous concrete matrix and the size of the images further increase the complexity. ML methods have proven to solve difficult segmentation problems when trained on enough and well annotated data. However, so far, there is not much 3D image data of cracks available at all, let alone annotated. Interactive annotation is error-prone as humans can easily tell cats from dogs or roads without from roads with cars but have a hard time deciding whether a thin and dark structure seen in a 2D slice continues in the next one. Training networks by synthetic, simulated images is an elegant way out, bears however its own challenges. In this contribution, we describe how to generate semi-synthetic image data to train CNN like the well known 3D U-Net or random forests for segmenting cracks in 3D images of concrete. The thickness of real cracks varies widely, both, within one crack as well as from crack to crack in the same sample. The segmentation method should therefore be invariant with respect to scale changes. We introduce the so-called RieszNet, designed for exactly this purpose. Finally, we discuss how to generalize the ML crack segmentation methods to other concrete types.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Transformers-based models have made significant progress in the field of image restoration by leveraging their inherent ability to capture complex contextual features. Recently, Mamba models have made a splash in the field of computer vision due to their ability to handle long-range dependencies and their significant computational efficiency compared to Transformers. However, Mamba currently lags behind Transformers in contextual learning capabilities. To overcome the limitations of these two models, we propose a Mamba-Transformer hybrid image restoration model called MatIR. Specifically, MatIR cross-cycles the blocks of the Transformer layer and the Mamba layer to extract features, thereby taking full advantage of the advantages of the two architectures. In the Mamba module, we introduce the Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module, which traverses along four scan paths to achieve efficient processing of long sequence data. In the Transformer module, we combine triangular window-based local attention with channel-based global attention to effectively activate the attention mechanism over a wider range of image pixels. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive study and improvement of the Restormer architecture for high-resolution image motion deblurring. We introduce architectural modifications that reduce model complexity by 18.4% while maintaining or improving performance through optimized attention mechanisms. Our enhanced training pipeline incorporates additional transformations including color jitter, Gaussian blur, and perspective transforms to improve model robustness as well as a new frequency loss term. Extensive experiments on the RealBlur-R, RealBlur-J, and Ultra-High-Definition Motion blurred (UHDM) datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The improved architecture shows better convergence behavior and reduced training time while maintaining competitive performance across challenging scenarios. We also provide detailed ablation studies analyzing the impact of our modifications on model behavior and performance. Our results suggest that thoughtful architectural simplification combined with enhanced training strategies can yield more efficient yet equally capable models for motion deblurring tasks.

- **Summary**: Image denoising algorithms have been extensively investigated for medical imaging. To perform image denoising, penalized least-squares (PLS) problems can be designed and solved, in which the penalty term encodes prior knowledge of the object being imaged. Sparsity-promoting penalties, such as total variation (TV), have been a popular choice for regularizing image denoising problems. However, such hand-crafted penalties may not be able to preserve task-relevant information in measured image data and can lead to oversmoothed image appearances and patchy artifacts that degrade signal detectability. Supervised learning methods that employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a popular approach to denoising medical images. However, studies have shown that CNNs trained with loss functions based on traditional image quality measures can lead to a loss of task-relevant information in images. Some previous works have investigated task-based loss functions that employ model observers for training the CNN denoising models. However, such training processes typically require a large number of noisy and ground-truth (noise-free or low-noise) image data pairs. In this work, we propose a task-based regularization strategy for use with PLS in medical image denoising. The proposed task-based regularization is associated with the likelihood of linear test statistics of noisy images for Gaussian noise models. The proposed method does not require ground-truth image data and solves an individual optimization problem for denoising each image. Computer-simulation studies are conducted that consider a multivariate-normally distributed (MVN) lumpy background and a binary texture background. It is demonstrated that the proposed regularization strategy can effectively improve signal detectability in denoised images.

- **Summary**: This paper presents SANA-1.5, a linear Diffusion Transformer for efficient scaling in text-to-image generation. Building upon SANA-1.0, we introduce three key innovations: (1) Efficient Training Scaling: A depth-growth paradigm that enables scaling from 1.6B to 4.8B parameters with significantly reduced computational resources, combined with a memory-efficient 8-bit optimizer. (2) Model Depth Pruning: A block importance analysis technique for efficient model compression to arbitrary sizes with minimal quality loss. (3) Inference-time Scaling: A repeated sampling strategy that trades computation for model capacity, enabling smaller models to match larger model quality at inference time. Through these strategies, SANA-1.5 achieves a text-image alignment score of 0.72 on GenEval, which can be further improved to 0.80 through inference scaling, establishing a new SoTA on GenEval benchmark. These innovations enable efficient model scaling across different compute budgets while maintaining high quality, making high-quality image generation more accessible.

- **Summary**: This study presents a novel approach to human keypoint detection in low-resolution thermal images using transfer learning techniques. We introduce the first application of the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test in thermal image computer vision, establishing a new paradigm for mobility assessment. Our method leverages a MobileNetV3-Small encoder and a ViTPose decoder, trained using a composite loss function that balances latent representation alignment and heatmap accuracy. The model was evaluated using the Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS) metric from the COCO Keypoint Detection Challenge. The proposed model achieves better performance with AP, AP50, and AP75 scores of 0.861, 0.942, and 0.887 respectively, outperforming traditional supervised learning approaches like Mask R-CNN and ViTPose-Base. Moreover, our model demonstrates superior computational efficiency in terms of parameter count and FLOPS. This research lays a solid foundation for future clinical applications of thermal imaging in mobility assessment and rehabilitation monitoring.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a task that detects OOD samples during inference to ensure the safety of deployed models. However, conventional benchmarks have reached performance saturation, making it difficult to compare recent OOD detection methods. To address this challenge, we introduce three novel OOD detection benchmarks that enable a deeper understanding of method characteristics and reflect real-world conditions. First, we present ImageNet-X, designed to evaluate performance under challenging semantic shifts. Second, we propose ImageNet-FS-X for full-spectrum OOD detection, assessing robustness to covariate shifts (feature distribution shifts). Finally, we propose Wilds-FS-X, which extends these evaluations to real-world datasets, offering a more comprehensive testbed. Our experiments reveal that recent CLIP-based OOD detection methods struggle to varying degrees across the three proposed benchmarks, and none of them consistently outperforms the others. We hope the community goes beyond specific benchmarks and includes more challenging conditions reflecting real-world scenarios. The code is https://github.com/hoshi23/OOD-X-Banchmarks.

- **Summary**: Vision foundation models have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities in segmentation tasks for both generic and specialized images. However, a performance gap persists between foundation models and task-specific, specialized models. Fine-tuning foundation models on downstream datasets is often necessary to bridge this gap. Unfortunately, obtaining fully annotated ground truth for downstream datasets is both challenging and costly. To address this limitation, we propose a novel test-time training paradigm that enhances the performance of foundation models on downstream datasets without requiring full annotations. Specifically, our method employs simple point prompts to guide a test-time semi-self-supervised training task. The model learns by resolving the ambiguity of the point prompt through various augmentations. This approach directly tackles challenges in the medical imaging field, where acquiring annotations is both time-intensive and expensive. We conducted extensive experiments on our new Videofluoroscopy dataset (VFSS-5k) for the instance segmentation task, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 0.868 across 12 anatomies with a single model.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which requires consistent identification of points across multiple frames in a video, despite changes in appearance, lighting, perspective, and occlusions. We target online tracking on a frame-by-frame basis, making it suitable for real-world, streaming scenarios. Specifically, we introduce Track-On, a simple transformer-based model designed for online long-term point tracking. Unlike prior methods that depend on full temporal modeling, our model processes video frames causally without access to future frames, leveraging two memory modules -- spatial memory and context memory -- to capture temporal information and maintain reliable point tracking over long time horizons. At inference time, it employs patch classification and refinement to identify correspondences and track points with high accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Track-On sets a new state-of-the-art for online models and delivers superior or competitive results compared to offline approaches on seven datasets, including the TAP-Vid benchmark. Our method offers a robust and scalable solution for real-time tracking in diverse applications. Project page: https://kuis-ai.github.io/track_on

- **Summary**: The increasing complexity of autonomous systems has amplified the need for accurate and reliable labeling of runway and taxiway markings to ensure operational safety. Precise detection and labeling of these markings are critical for tasks such as navigation, landing assistance, and ground control automation. Existing labeling algorithms, like the Automated Line Identification and Notation Algorithm (ALINA), have demonstrated success in identifying taxiway markings but encounter significant challenges when applied to runway markings. This limitation arises due to notable differences in line characteristics, environmental context, and interference from elements such as shadows, tire marks, and varying surface conditions. To address these challenges, we modified ALINA by adjusting color thresholds and refining region of interest (ROI) selection to better suit runway-specific contexts. While these modifications yielded limited improvements, the algorithm still struggled with consistent runway identification, often mislabeling elements such as the horizon or non-relevant background features. This highlighted the need for a more robust solution capable of adapting to diverse visual interferences. In this paper, we propose integrating a classification step using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named AssistNet. By incorporating this classification step, the detection pipeline becomes more resilient to environmental variations and misclassifications. This work not only identifies the challenges but also outlines solutions, paving the way for improved automated labeling techniques essential for autonomous aviation systems.

- **Summary**: Mamba has demonstrated exceptional performance in visual tasks due to its powerful global modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, offering considerable potential in hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSISR). However, in HSISR, Mamba faces challenges as transforming images into 1D sequences neglects the spatial-spectral structural relationships between locally adjacent pixels, and its performance is highly sensitive to input order, which affects the restoration of both spatial and spectral details. In this paper, we propose HSRMamba, a contextual spatial-spectral modeling state space model for HSISR, to address these issues both locally and globally. Specifically, a local spatial-spectral partitioning mechanism is designed to establish patch-wise causal relationships among adjacent pixels in 3D features, mitigating the local forgetting issue. Furthermore, a global spectral reordering strategy based on spectral similarity is employed to enhance the causal representation of similar pixels across both spatial and spectral dimensions. Finally, experimental results demonstrate our HSRMamba outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in quantitative quality and visual results. Code will be available soon.

- **Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) image recognition is a powerful tool for extracting data from images, but accuracy depends on providing sufficient cues in the prompt - requiring a domain expert for specialized tasks. We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.

- **Summary**: Dense action detection involves detecting multiple co-occurring actions in an untrimmed video while action classes are often ambiguous and represent overlapping concepts. To address this challenge task, we introduce a novel perspective inspired by how humans tackle complex tasks by breaking them into manageable sub-tasks. Instead of relying on a single network to address the entire problem, as in current approaches, we propose decomposing the problem into detecting key concepts present in action classes, specifically, detecting dense static concepts and detecting dense dynamic concepts, and assigning them to distinct, specialized networks. Furthermore, simultaneous actions in a video often exhibit interrelationships, and exploiting these relationships can improve performance. However, we argue that current networks fail to effectively learn these relationships due to their reliance on binary cross-entropy optimization, which treats each class independently. To address this limitation, we propose providing explicit supervision on co-occurring concepts during network optimization through a novel language-guided contrastive learning loss. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial relative improvements of 23.4% and 2.5% mAP on the challenging benchmark datasets, Charades and MultiTHUMOS.



### Integrating Spatial and Frequency Information for Under-Display Camera Image Restoration

- **Summary**: Under-Display Camera (UDC) houses a digital camera lens under a display panel. However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur, decrease in transmittance, and flare. Despite the remarkable progress, previous research on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain and rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain. It is essential to consider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively. For example, degradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information (e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain). At the same time, tackling flares may require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain). In this paper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out intrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares. Based on this observation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM. It efficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the collective contribution of all points in the image) information. The architecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to capture global information. SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a Frequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration Block (AMIB). Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise and blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as flare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction. SFIM's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches is demonstrated through rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments across three UDC benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their deployment in safety-critical domains poses significant challenges. Existing safety fine-tuning methods, which focus on textual or multimodal content, fall short in addressing challenging cases or disrupt the balance between helpfulness and harmlessness. Our evaluation highlights a safety reasoning gap: these methods lack safety visual reasoning ability, leading to such bottlenecks. To address this limitation and enhance both visual perception and reasoning in safety-critical contexts, we propose a novel dataset that integrates multi-image inputs with safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) labels as fine-grained reasoning logic to improve model performance. Specifically, we introduce the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, an instruction-following dataset tailored for multi-image safety scenarios, consisting of training and test splits. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning InternVL2.5-8B with MIS significantly outperforms both powerful open-source models and API-based models in challenging multi-image tasks requiring safety-related visual reasoning. This approach not only delivers exceptional safety performance but also preserves general capabilities without any trade-offs. Specifically, fine-tuning with MIS increases average accuracy by 0.83% across five general benchmarks and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) on multiple safety benchmarks by a large margin. Data and Models are released under: \href{https://dripnowhy.github.io/MIS/}{\texttt{https://dripnowhy.github.io/MIS/}}

- **Summary**: Facial Emotion Recognition has emerged as increasingly pivotal in the domain of User Experience, notably within modern usability testing, as it facilitates a deeper comprehension of user satisfaction and engagement. This study aims to extend the ResEmoteNet model by employing a knowledge distillation framework to develop Mini-ResEmoteNet models - lightweight student models - tailored for usability testing. Experiments were conducted on the FER2013 and RAF-DB datasets to assess the efficacy of three student model architectures: Student Model A, Student Model B, and Student Model C. Their development involves reducing the number of feature channels in each layer of the teacher model by approximately 50%, 75%, and 87.5%. Demonstrating exceptional performance on the FER2013 dataset, Student Model A (E1) achieved a test accuracy of 76.33%, marking a 0.21% absolute improvement over EmoNeXt. Moreover, the results exhibit absolute improvements in terms of inference speed and memory usage during inference compared to the ResEmoteNet model. The findings indicate that the proposed methods surpass other state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: A clear understanding of where humans move in a scenario, their usual paths and speeds, and where they stop, is very important for different applications, such as mobility studies in urban areas or robot navigation tasks within human-populated environments. We propose in this article, a neural architecture based on Vision Transformers (ViTs) to provide this information. This solution can arguably capture spatial correlations more effectively than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In the paper, we describe the methodology and proposed neural architecture and show the experiments' results with a standard dataset. We show that the proposed ViT architecture improves the metrics compared to a method based on a CNN.

- **Summary**: Under Display Camera (UDC) is an advanced imaging system that places a digital camera lens underneath a display panel, effectively concealing the camera. However, the display panel significantly degrades captured images or videos, introducing low transmittance, blur, noise, and flare issues. Tackling such issues is challenging because of the complex degradation of UDCs, including diverse flare patterns. Despite extensive research on UDC images and their restoration models, studies on videos have yet to be significantly explored. While two UDC video datasets exist, they primarily focus on unrealistic or synthetic UDC degradation rather than real-world UDC degradation. In this paper, we propose a real-world UDC video dataset called UDC-VIT. Unlike existing datasets, only UDC-VIT exclusively includes human motions that target facial recognition. We propose a video-capturing system to simultaneously acquire non-degraded and UDC-degraded videos of the same scene. Then, we align a pair of captured videos frame by frame, using discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We compare UDC-VIT with six representative UDC still image datasets and two existing UDC video datasets. Using six deep-learning models, we compare UDC-VIT and an existing synthetic UDC video dataset. The results indicate the ineffectiveness of models trained on earlier synthetic UDC video datasets, as they do not reflect the actual characteristics of UDC-degraded videos. We also demonstrate the importance of effective UDC restoration by evaluating face recognition accuracy concerning PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores. UDC-VIT enables further exploration in the UDC video restoration and offers better insights into the challenge. UDC-VIT is available at our project site.

- **Summary**: With recent advancements in the capabilities of Text-to-Image (T2I) AI models, product designers have begun experimenting with them in their work. However, T2I models struggle to interpret abstract language and the current user experience of T2I tools can induce design fixation rather than a more iterative, exploratory process. To address these challenges, we developed Inkspire, a sketch-driven tool that supports designers in prototyping product design concepts with analogical inspirations and a complete sketch-to-design-to-sketch feedback loop. To inform the design of Inkspire, we conducted an exchange session with designers and distilled design goals for improving T2I interactions. In a within-subjects study comparing Inkspire to ControlNet, we found that Inkspire supported designers with more inspiration and exploration of design ideas, and improved aspects of the co-creative process by allowing designers to effectively grasp the current state of the AI to guide it towards novel design intentions.

- **Summary**: Understanding and modeling lighting effects are fundamental tasks in computer vision and graphics. Classic physically-based rendering (PBR) accurately simulates the light transport, but relies on precise scene representations--explicit 3D geometry, high-quality material properties, and lighting conditions--that are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we introduce DiffusionRenderer, a neural approach that addresses the dual problem of inverse and forward rendering within a holistic framework. Leveraging powerful video diffusion model priors, the inverse rendering model accurately estimates G-buffers from real-world videos, providing an interface for image editing tasks, and training data for the rendering model. Conversely, our rendering model generates photorealistic images from G-buffers without explicit light transport simulation. Experiments demonstrate that DiffusionRenderer effectively approximates inverse and forwards rendering, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art. Our model enables practical applications from a single video input--including relighting, material editing, and realistic object insertion.

- **Summary**: In real-world scenarios, achieving domain adaptation and generalization poses significant challenges, as models must adapt to or generalize across unknown target distributions. Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models. For each topic, we formally define the problem and thoroughly review existing methods. Additionally, we analyze relevant datasets and applications, highlighting open challenges and potential future research directions. We maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature at https://github.com/donghao51/Awesome-Multimodal-Adaptation.

- **Summary**: Tokenizing images into compact visual representations is a key step in learning efficient and high-quality image generative models. We present a simple diffusion tokenizer (DiTo) that learns compact visual representations for image generation models. Our key insight is that a single learning objective, diffusion L2 loss, can be used for training scalable image tokenizers. Since diffusion is already widely used for image generation, our insight greatly simplifies training such tokenizers. In contrast, current state-of-the-art tokenizers rely on an empirically found combination of heuristics and losses, thus requiring a complex training recipe that relies on non-trivially balancing different losses and pretrained supervised models. We show design decisions, along with theoretical grounding, that enable us to scale DiTo for learning competitive image representations. Our results show that DiTo is a simpler, scalable, and self-supervised alternative to the current state-of-the-art image tokenizer which is supervised. DiTo achieves competitive or better quality than state-of-the-art in image reconstruction and downstream image generation tasks.

- **Summary**: The 3D point cloud representation plays a crucial role in preserving the geometric fidelity of the physical world, enabling more accurate complex 3D environments. While humans naturally comprehend the intricate relationships between objects and variations through a multisensory system, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have yet to fully replicate this capacity. To bridge this gap, it becomes essential to incorporate multiple modalities. Models that can seamlessly integrate and reason across these modalities are known as foundation models (FMs). The development of FMs for 2D modalities, such as images and text, has seen significant progress, driven by the abundant availability of large-scale datasets. However, the 3D domain has lagged due to the scarcity of labelled data and high computational overheads. In response, recent research has begun to explore the potential of applying FMs to 3D tasks, overcoming these challenges by leveraging existing 2D knowledge. Additionally, language, with its capacity for abstract reasoning and description of the environment, offers a promising avenue for enhancing 3D understanding through large pre-trained language models (LLMs). Despite the rapid development and adoption of FMs for 3D vision tasks in recent years, there remains a gap in comprehensive and in-depth literature reviews. This article aims to address this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art methods that utilize FMs for 3D visual understanding. We start by reviewing various strategies employed in the building of various 3D FMs. Then we categorize and summarize use of different FMs for tasks such as perception tasks. Finally, the article offers insights into future directions for research and development in this field. To help reader, we have curated list of relevant papers on the topic: https://github.com/vgthengane/Awesome-FMs-in-3D.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing an object's shape and appearance in terms of a mesh textured by a spatially-varying bidirectional reflectance distribution function (SVBRDF) from a limited set of images captured under collocated light is an ill-posed problem. Previous state-of-the-art approaches either aim to reconstruct the appearance directly on the geometry or additionally use texture normals as part of the appearance features. However, this requires detailed but inefficiently large meshes, that would have to be simplified in a post-processing step, or suffers from well-known limitations of normal maps such as missing shadows or incorrect silhouettes. Another limiting factor is the fixed and typically low resolution of the texture estimation resulting in loss of important surface details. To overcome these problems, we present ROSA, an inverse rendering method that directly optimizes mesh geometry with spatially adaptive mesh resolution solely based on the image data. In particular, we refine the mesh and locally condition the surface smoothness based on the estimated normal texture and mesh curvature. In addition, we enable the reconstruction of fine appearance details in high-resolution textures through a pioneering tile-based method that operates on a single pre-trained decoder network but is not limited by the network output resolution.
