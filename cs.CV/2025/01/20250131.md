- **Summary**: We developed a generative patch based 3D image registration model that can register very high resolution images obtained from a biochemical process name tissue clearing. Tissue clearing process removes lipids and fats from the tissue and make the tissue transparent. When cleared tissues are imaged with Light-sheet fluorescent microscopy, the resulting images give a clear window to the cellular activities and dynamics inside the tissue.Thus the images obtained are very rich with cellular information and hence their resolution is extremely high (eg .2560x2160x676). Analyzing images with such high resolution is a difficult task for any image analysis pipeline.Image registration is a common step in image analysis pipeline when comparison between images are required. Traditional image registration methods fail to register images with such extant. In this paper we addressed this very high resolution image registration issue by proposing a patch-based generative network named InvGAN. Our proposed network can register very high resolution tissue cleared images. The tissue cleared dataset used in this paper are obtained from a tissue clearing protocol named CUBIC. We compared our method both with traditional and deep-learning based registration methods.Two different versions of CUBIC dataset are used, representing two different resolutions 25% and 100% respectively. Experiments on two different resolutions clearly show the impact of resolution on the registration quality. At 25% resolution, our method achieves comparable registration accuracy with very short time (7 minutes approximately). At 100% resolution, most of the traditional registration methods fail except Elastix registration tool.Elastix takes 28 hours to register where proposed InvGAN takes only 10 minutes.

- **Summary**: Defacing is often applied to head magnetic resonance image (MRI) datasets prior to public release to address privacy concerns. The alteration of facial and nearby voxels has provoked discussions about the true capability of these techniques to ensure privacy as well as their impact on downstream tasks. With advancements in deep generative models, the extent to which defacing can protect privacy is uncertain. Additionally, while the altered voxels are known to contain valuable anatomical information, their potential to support research beyond the anatomical regions directly affected by defacing remains uncertain. To evaluate these considerations, we develop a refacing pipeline that recovers faces in defaced head MRIs using cascaded diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). The DPMs are trained on images from 180 subjects and tested on images from 484 unseen subjects, 469 of whom are from a different dataset. To assess whether the altered voxels in defacing contain universally useful information, we also predict computed tomography (CT)-derived skeletal muscle radiodensity from facial voxels in both defaced and original MRIs. The results show that DPMs can generate high-fidelity faces that resemble the original faces from defaced images, with surface distances to the original faces significantly smaller than those of a population average face (p < 0.05). This performance also generalizes well to previously unseen datasets. For skeletal muscle radiodensity predictions, using defaced images results in significantly weaker Spearman's rank correlation coefficients compared to using original images (p < 10-4). For shin muscle, the correlation is statistically significant (p < 0.05) when using original images but not statistically significant (p > 0.05) when any defacing method is applied, suggesting that defacing might not only fail to protect privacy but also eliminate valuable information.

- **Summary**: Global Coconut (Cocos nucifera (L.)) cultivation faces significant challenges, including yield loss, due to pest and disease outbreaks. In particular, Weligama Coconut Leaf Wilt Disease (WCWLD) and Coconut Caterpillar Infestation (CCI) damage coconut trees, causing severe coconut production loss in Sri Lanka and nearby coconut-producing countries. Currently, both WCWLD and CCI are detected through on-field human observations, a process that is not only time-consuming but also limits the early detection of infections. This paper presents a study conducted in Sri Lanka, demonstrating the effectiveness of employing transfer learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Mask Region-based-CNN (Mask R-CNN) to identify WCWLD and CCI at their early stages and to assess disease progression. Further, this paper presents the use of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection model to count the number of caterpillars distributed on leaves with CCI. The introduced methods were tested and validated using datasets collected from Matara, Puttalam, and Makandura, Sri Lanka. The results show that the proposed methods identify WCWLD and CCI with an accuracy of 90% and 95%, respectively. In addition, the proposed WCWLD disease severity identification method classifies the severity with an accuracy of 97%. Furthermore, the accuracies of the object detection models for calculating the number of caterpillars in the leaflets were: YOLOv5-96.87%, YOLOv8-96.1%, and YOLO11-95.9%.

- **Summary**: Most existing RGB-D semantic segmentation methods focus on the feature level fusion, including complex cross-modality and cross-scale fusion modules. However, these methods may cause misalignment problem in the feature fusion process and counter-intuitive patches in the segmentation results. Inspired by the popular pixel-node-pixel pipeline, we propose to 1) fuse features from two modalities in a late fusion style, during which the geometric feature injection is guided by texture feature prior; 2) employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the fused feature to alleviate the emergence of irregular patches by inferring patch relationship. At the 3D feature extraction stage, we argue that traditional CNNs are not efficient enough for depth maps. So, we encode depth map into normal map, after which CNNs can easily extract object surface tendencies.At projection matrix generation stage, we find the existence of Biased-Assignment and Ambiguous-Locality issues in the original pipeline. Therefore, we propose to 1) adopt the Kullback-Leibler Loss to ensure no missing important pixel features, which can be viewed as hard pixel mining process; 2) connect regions that are close to each other in the Euclidean space as well as in the semantic space with larger edge weights so that location informations can been considered. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, NYU-DepthV2 and SUN RGB-D, have shown that our approach can consistently boost the performance of RGB-D semantic segmentation task.

- **Summary**: Automatic crack segmentation is a cornerstone technology for intelligent visual perception modules in road safety maintenance and structural integrity systems. Existing deep learning models and ``pre-training + fine-tuning'' paradigms often face challenges of limited adaptability in resource-constrained environments and inadequate scalability across diverse data domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexiCrackNet, a novel pipeline that seamlessly integrates traditional deep learning paradigms with the strengths of large-scale pre-trained models. At its core, FlexiCrackNet employs an encoder-decoder architecture to extract task-specific features. The lightweight EdgeSAM's CNN-based encoder is exclusively used as a generic feature extractor, decoupled from the fixed input size requirements of EdgeSAM. To harmonize general and domain-specific features, we introduce the information-Interaction gated attention mechanism (IGAM), which adaptively fuses multi-level features to enhance segmentation performance while mitigating irrelevant noise. This design enables the efficient transfer of general knowledge to crack segmentation tasks while ensuring adaptability to diverse input resolutions and resource-constrained environments. Experiments show that FlexiCrackNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, excels in zero-shot generalization, computational efficiency, and segmentation robustness under challenging scenarios such as blurry inputs, complex backgrounds, and visually ambiguous artifacts. These advancements underscore the potential of FlexiCrackNet for real-world applications in automated crack detection and comprehensive structural health monitoring systems.

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation of pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a technique for tackling distribution shifts during the test time. Although existing methods, especially those based on Test-time Prompt Tuning (TPT), have shown promising results, their high computational cost associated with parameter optimization presents challenges for scalability and practical application. This paper unveils the unnecessary nature of backpropagation in existing methods from a loss landscape perspective. Building on this insight, this paper proposes a simple yet effective framework called Test-time Loss Landscape Adaptation (TLLA). TLLA leverages the relative position between the training minimum and test loss landscapes to guide the adaptation process, avoiding the update of model parameters at test time. Specifically, it mainly consists of two main stages: In the prompt tuning stage, a Sharpness-Aware Prompt Tuning (SAPT) method is introduced to identify the training flat minimum, setting the foundation for the subsequent test-time adaptation; In the test stage, a Sharpness-based Test Sample Selection (STSS) approach is utilized to ensure the alignment of flat minima within the training loss landscape and each augmented test sample's loss landscape. Extensive experiments on both domain generalization and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that TLLA achieves state-of-the-art performances while significantly reducing computational overhead. Notably, TLLA surpasses TPT by an average of 5.32\% and 6.98\% on four ImageNet variant datasets when employing ResNet50 and ViT-B/16 image encoders, respectively. The code will be available soon.

- **Summary**: Guidance techniques are simple yet effective for improving conditional generation in diffusion models. Albeit their empirical success, the practical implementation of guidance diverges significantly from its theoretical motivation. In this paper, we reconcile this discrepancy by replacing the scaled marginal distribution target, which we prove theoretically invalid, with a valid scaled joint distribution objective. Additionally, we show that the established guidance implementations are approximations to the intractable optimal solution under no future foresight constraint. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose rectified gradient guidance (REG), a versatile enhancement designed to boost the performance of existing guidance methods. Experiments on 1D and 2D demonstrate that REG provides a better approximation to the optimal solution than prior guidance techniques, validating the proposed theoretical framework. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation tasks show that incorporating REG consistently improves FID and Inception/CLIP scores across various settings compared to its absence.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the generalization capabilities. VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning has gained significant attention in contemporary applications, particularly due to the scarcity of labeled data. While existing SSL methodologies primarily address feature variance and linear correlations, they often neglect the intricate relations between samples and the nonlinear dependencies inherent in complex data. In this paper, we introduce Correlation-Dependence Self-Supervised Learning (CDSSL), a novel framework that unifies and extends existing SSL paradigms by integrating both linear correlations and nonlinear dependencies, encapsulating sample-wise and feature-wise interactions. Our approach incorporates the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to robustly capture nonlinear dependencies within a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, enriching representation learning. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of CDSSL in improving representation quality.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models show remarkable generation performance following text prompts, but risk generating Not Safe For Work (NSFW) contents from unsafe prompts. Existing approaches, such as prompt filtering or concept unlearning, fail to defend against adversarial attacks while maintaining benign image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Distorting Embedding Space (DES), a text encoder-based defense mechanism that effectively tackles these issues through innovative embedding space control. DES transforms unsafe embeddings, extracted from a text encoder using unsafe prompts, toward carefully calculated safe embedding regions to prevent unsafe contents generation, while reproducing the original safe embeddings. DES also neutralizes the nudity embedding, extracted using prompt ``nudity", by aligning it with neutral embedding to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks. These methods ensure both robust defense and high-quality image generation. Additionally, DES can be adopted in a plug-and-play manner and requires zero inference overhead, facilitating its deployment. Extensive experiments on diverse attack types, including black-box and white-box scenarios, demonstrate DES's state-of-the-art performance in both defense capability and benign image generation quality.

- **Summary**: Vision-language model (VLM) fine-tuning for application-specific visual grounding based on natural language instructions has become one of the most popular approaches for learning-enabled autonomous systems. However, such fine-tuning relies heavily on high-quality datasets to achieve successful performance in various downstream tasks. Additionally, VLMs often encounter limitations due to insufficient and imbalanced fine-tuning data. To address these issues, we propose a new generalizable framework to improve VLM fine-tuning by integrating it with a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. Our method utilizes the RL agent to manipulate objects within an indoor setting to create synthetic data for fine-tuning to address certain vulnerabilities of the VLM. Specifically, we use the performance of the VLM to provide feedback to the RL agent to generate informative data that efficiently fine-tune the VLM over the targeted task (e.g. spatial reasoning). The key contribution of this work is developing a framework where the RL agent serves as an informative data sampling tool and assists the VLM in order to enhance performance and address task-specific vulnerabilities. By targeting the data sampling process to address the weaknesses of the VLM, we can effectively train a more context-aware model. In addition, generating synthetic data allows us to have precise control over each scene and generate granular ground truth captions. Our results show that the proposed data generation approach improves the spatial reasoning performance of VLMs, which demonstrates the benefits of using RL-guided data generation in vision-language tasks.

- **Summary**: Controlling human gestures based on speech signals presents a significant challenge in computer vision. While existing works did preliminary studies of generating holistic co-speech gesture from speech, the spatial interaction of each body region during the speech remains barely explored. This leads to wield body part interactions given the speech signal. Furthermore, the slow generation speed limits the construction of real-world digital avatars. To resolve these problems, we propose \textbf{GestureLSM}, a Latent Shortcut based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. We tokenize various body regions and explicitly model their interactions with spatial and temporal attention. To achieve real-time gesture generations, we exam the denoising patterns and design an effective time distribution to speed up sampling while improve the generation quality for shortcut model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GestureLSM, showcasing its potential for various applications in the development of digital humans and embodied agents.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in diffusion models have been leveraged to address inverse problems without additional training, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) (Chung et al., 2022a) is among the most popular approaches. Previous analyses suggest that DPS accomplishes posterior sampling by approximating the conditional score. While in this paper, we demonstrate that the conditional score approximation employed by DPS is not as effective as previously assumed, but rather aligns more closely with the principle of maximizing a posterior (MAP). This assertion is substantiated through an examination of DPS on 512x512 ImageNet images, revealing that: 1) DPS's conditional score estimation significantly diverges from the score of a well-trained conditional diffusion model and is even inferior to the unconditional score; 2) The mean of DPS's conditional score estimation deviates significantly from zero, rendering it an invalid score estimation; 3) DPS generates high-quality samples with significantly lower diversity. In light of the above findings, we posit that DPS more closely resembles MAP than a conditional score estimator, and accordingly propose the following enhancements to DPS: 1) we explicitly maximize the posterior through multi-step gradient ascent and projection; 2) we utilize a light-weighted conditional score estimator trained with only 100 images and 8 GPU hours. Extensive experimental results indicate that these proposed improvements significantly enhance DPS's performance. The source code for these improvements is provided in https://github.com/tongdaxu/Rethinking-Diffusion-Posterior-Sampling-From-Conditional-Score-Estimator-to-Maximizing-a-Posterior.

- **Summary**: The U-Net architecture and its variants have remained state-of-the-art (SOTA) for retinal vessel segmentation over the past decade. In this study, we introduce a Full Scale Guided Network (FSG-Net), where the feature representation network with modernized convolution blocks extracts full-scale information and the guided convolution block refines that information. Attention-guided filter is introduced to the guided convolution block under the interpretation that the filter behaves like the unsharp mask filter. Passing full-scale information to the attention block allows for the generation of improved attention maps, which are then passed to the attention-guided filter, resulting in performance enhancement of the segmentation network. The structure preceding the guided convolution block can be replaced by any U-Net variant, which enhances the scalability of the proposed approach. For a fair comparison, we re-implemented recent studies available in public repositories to evaluate their scalability and reproducibility. Our experiments also show that the proposed network demonstrates competitive results compared to current SOTA models on various public datasets. Ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with much smaller parameter sizes. Lastly, by applying the proposed model to facial wrinkle segmentation, we confirmed the potential for scalability to similar tasks in other domains. Our code is available on https://github.com/ZombaSY/FSG-Net-pytorch.

- **Summary**: Edge detection is a cornerstone of image processing, yet existing methods often face critical limitations. Traditional deep learning edge detection methods require extensive training datasets and fine-tuning, while classical techniques often fail in complex or noisy scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, quantum-inspired edge detection model. Our approach integrates classical Sobel edge detection, the Schr\"odinger wave equation refinement, and a hybrid framework combining Canny and Laplacian operators. By eliminating the need for training, the model is lightweight and adaptable to diverse applications. The Schr\"odinger wave equation refines gradient-based edge maps through iterative diffusion, significantly enhancing edge precision. The hybrid framework further strengthens the model by synergistically combining local and global features, ensuring robustness even under challenging conditions. Extensive evaluations on datasets like BIPED, Multicue, and NYUD demonstrate superior performance of the proposed model, achieving state-of-the-art metrics, including ODS, OIS, AP, and F-measure. Noise robustness experiments highlight its reliability, showcasing its practicality for real-world scenarios. Due to its versatile and adaptable nature, our model is well-suited for applications such as medical imaging, autonomous systems, and environmental monitoring, setting a new benchmark for edge detection.

- **Summary**: Recently, 4D Radar has emerged as a crucial sensor for 3D object detection in autonomous vehicles, offering both stable perception in adverse weather and high-density point clouds for object shape recognition. However, processing such high-density data demands substantial computational resources and energy consumption. We propose SpikingRTNH, the first spiking neural network (SNN) for 3D object detection using 4D Radar data. By replacing conventional ReLU activation functions with leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons, SpikingRTNH achieves significant energy efficiency gains. Furthermore, inspired by human cognitive processes, we introduce biological top-down inference (BTI), which processes point clouds sequentially from higher to lower densities. This approach effectively utilizes points with lower noise and higher importance for detection. Experiments on K-Radar dataset demonstrate that SpikingRTNH with BTI significantly reduces energy consumption by 78% while achieving comparable detection performance to its ANN counterpart (51.1% AP 3D, 57.0% AP BEV). These results establish the viability of SNNs for energy-efficient 4D Radar-based object detection in autonomous driving systems.

- **Summary**: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has recently emerged as a powerful method for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks. By introducing learnable prompt tokens as task-specific instructions, VPT effectively guides pre-trained transformer models with minimal overhead. Despite its empirical success, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of VPT remains an active area of research. Building on recent insights into the connection between mixture of experts and prompt-based approaches, we identify a key limitation in VPT: the restricted functional expressiveness in prompt formulation. To address this limitation, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompt Tuning (VAPT), a new generation of prompts that redefines prompts as adaptive functions of the input. Our theoretical analysis shows that this simple yet intuitive approach achieves optimal sample efficiency. Empirical results on VTAB-1K and FGVC further demonstrate VAPT's effectiveness, with performance gains of 7.34% and 1.04% over fully fine-tuning baselines, respectively. Notably, VAPT also surpasses VPT by a substantial margin while using fewer parameters. These results highlight both the effectiveness and efficiency of our method and pave the way for future research to explore the potential of adaptive prompts.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in LLMs have accelerated the development of dialogue generation across text and images, yet video-based dialogue generation remains underexplored and presents unique challenges. In this paper, we introduce Theme-aware Video Dialogue Crafting (TVDC), a novel task aimed at generating new dialogues that align with video content and adhere to user-specified themes. We propose TV-Dialogue, a novel multi-modal agent framework that ensures both theme alignment (i.e., the dialogue revolves around the theme) and visual consistency (i.e., the dialogue matches the emotions and behaviors of characters in the video) by enabling real-time immersive interactions among video characters, thereby accurately understanding the video content and generating new dialogue that aligns with the given themes. To assess the generated dialogues, we present a multi-granularity evaluation benchmark with high accuracy, interpretability and reliability, demonstrating the effectiveness of TV-Dialogue on self-collected dataset over directly using existing LLMs. Extensive experiments reveal that TV-Dialogue can generate dialogues for videos of any length and any theme in a zero-shot manner without training. Our findings underscore the potential of TV-Dialogue for various applications, such as video re-creation, film dubbing and its use in downstream multimodal tasks.

- **Summary**: Concept erasure has emerged as a promising technique for mitigating the risk of harmful content generation in diffusion models by selectively unlearning undesirable concepts. The common principle of previous works to remove a specific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral concept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this fixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of erasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the concept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one concept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric properties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is confined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE) method, which \emph{dynamically} selects optimal target concepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side effects. Experimental results show that AGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods on preserving unrelated concepts while maintaining effective erasure performance.

- **Summary**: Recent open-vocabulary detectors achieve promising performance with abundant region-level annotated data. In this work, we show that an open-vocabulary detector co-training with a large language model by generating image-level detailed captions for each image can further improve performance. To achieve the goal, we first collect a dataset, GroundingCap-1M, wherein each image is accompanied by associated grounding labels and an image-level detailed caption. With this dataset, we finetune an open-vocabulary detector with training objectives including a standard grounding loss and a caption generation loss. We take advantage of a large language model to generate both region-level short captions for each region of interest and image-level long captions for the whole image. Under the supervision of the large language model, the resulting detector, LLMDet, outperforms the baseline by a clear margin, enjoying superior open-vocabulary ability. Further, we show that the improved LLMDet can in turn build a stronger large multi-modal model, achieving mutual benefits.

- **Summary**: Recently, significant advancements have been made in the reconstruction and generation of 3D assets, including static cases and those with physical interactions. To recover the physical properties of 3D assets, existing methods typically assume that all materials belong to a specific predefined category (e.g., elasticity). However, such assumptions ignore the complex composition of multiple heterogeneous objects in real scenarios and tend to render less physically plausible animation given a wider range of objects. We propose OmniPhysGS for synthesizing a physics-based 3D dynamic scene composed of more general objects. A key design of OmniPhysGS is treating each 3D asset as a collection of constitutive 3D Gaussians. For each Gaussian, its physical material is represented by an ensemble of 12 physical domain-expert sub-models (rubber, metal, honey, water, etc.), which greatly enhances the flexibility of the proposed model. In the implementation, we define a scene by user-specified prompts and supervise the estimation of material weighting factors via a pretrained video diffusion model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPhysGS achieves more general and realistic physical dynamics across a broader spectrum of materials, including elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, and fluid substances, as well as interactions between different materials. Our method surpasses existing methods by approximately 3% to 16% in metrics of visual quality and text alignment.

- **Summary**: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive number of patches in gigapixel images. While transformer architectures excel at modeling long-range correlations through self-attention, their quadratic computational complexity makes them impractical for computational pathology applications. Existing solutions like local-global or linear self-attention reduce computational costs but compromise the strong modeling capabilities of full self-attention. In this work, we propose Querent, i.e., the query-aware long contextual dynamic modeling framework, which maintains the expressive power of full self-attention while achieving practical efficiency. Our method adaptively predicts which surrounding regions are most relevant for each patch, enabling focused yet unrestricted attention computation only with potentially important contexts. By using efficient region-wise metadata computation and importance estimation, our approach dramatically reduces computational overhead while preserving global perception to model fine-grained patch correlations. Through comprehensive experiments on biomarker prediction, gene mutation prediction, cancer subtyping, and survival analysis across over 10 WSI datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Code will be made available at https://github.com/dddavid4real/Querent.

- **Summary**: Image Super-Resolution (ISR) has seen significant progress with the introduction of remarkable generative models. However, challenges such as the trade-off issues between fidelity and realism, as well as computational complexity, have also posed limitations on their application. Building upon the tremendous success of autoregressive models in the language domain, we propose \textbf{VARSR}, a novel visual autoregressive modeling for ISR framework with the form of next-scale prediction. To effectively integrate and preserve semantic information in low-resolution images, we propose using prefix tokens to incorporate the condition. Scale-aligned Rotary Positional Encodings are introduced to capture spatial structures and the diffusion refiner is utilized for modeling quantization residual loss to achieve pixel-level fidelity. Image-based Classifier-free Guidance is proposed to guide the generation of more realistic images. Furthermore, we collect large-scale data and design a training process to obtain robust generative priors. Quantitative and qualitative results show that VARSR is capable of generating high-fidelity and high-realism images with more efficiency than diffusion-based methods. Our codes will be released at https://github.com/qyp2000/VARSR.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenges in learning-based monocular positioning by proposing VKFPos, a novel approach that integrates Absolute Pose Regression (APR) and Relative Pose Regression (RPR) via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) within a variational Bayesian inference framework. Our method shows that the essential posterior probability of the monocular positioning problem can be decomposed into APR and RPR components. This decomposition is embedded in the deep learning model by predicting covariances in both APR and RPR branches, allowing them to account for associated uncertainties. These covariances enhance the loss functions and facilitate EKF integration. Experimental evaluations on both indoor and outdoor datasets show that the single-shot APR branch achieves accuracy on par with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, for temporal positioning, where consecutive images allow for RPR and EKF integration, VKFPos outperforms temporal APR and model-based integration methods, achieving superior accuracy.

- **Summary**: Pathology detection in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) using deep learning has been explored in the recent past. However, deep learning models can be influenced by the color quality of the dataset used to train them, impacting detection, segmentation and classification tasks. In this work, we evaluate the impact of color correction on pathology detection using two prominent object detection models: Retinanet and YOLOv5. We first generate two color corrected versions of a popular WCE dataset (i.e., SEE-AI dataset) using two different color correction functions. We then evaluate the performance of the Retinanet and YOLOv5 on the original and color corrected versions of the dataset. The results reveal that color correction makes the models generate larger bounding boxes and larger intersection areas with the ground truth annotations. Furthermore, color correction leads to an increased number of false positives for certain pathologies. However, these effects do not translate into a consistent improvement in performance metrics such as F1-scores, IoU, and AP50. The code is available at https://github.com/agossouema2011/WCE2024.

- **Summary**: Purpose: We present a virtual model to optimize point of entry (POE) in lung biopsy planning systems. Our model allows to compute the quality of a biopsy sample taken from potential POE, taking into account the margin of error that arises from discrepancies between the orientation in the planning simulation and the actual orientation during the operation. Additionally, the study examines the impact of the characteristics of the lesion. Methods: The quality of the biopsy is given by a heatmap projected onto the skeleton of a patient-specific model of airways. The skeleton provides a 3D representation of airways structure, while the heatmap intensity represents the potential amount of tissue that it could be extracted from each POE. This amount of tissue is determined by the intersection of the lesion with a cone that represents the uncertainty area in the introduction of biopsy instruments. The cone, lesion, and skeleton are modelled as graphical objects that define a 3D scene of the intervention. Results: We have simulated different settings of the intervention scene from a single anatomy extracted from a CT scan and two lesions with regular and irregular shapes. The different scenarios are simulated by systematic rotation of each lesion placed at different distances from airways. Analysis of the heatmaps for the different settings show a strong impact of lesion orientation for irregular shape and the distance for both shapes. Conclusion: The proposed heatmaps help to visually assess the optimal POE and identify whether multiple optimal POEs exist in different zones of the bronchi. They also allow us to model the maximum allowable error in navigation systems and study which variables have the greatest influence on the success of the operation. Additionally, they help determine at what point this influence could potentially jeopardize the operation.

- **Summary**: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in applications such as health monitoring, smart home automation, and human-computer interaction. While HAR has been extensively studied, action summarization, which involves identifying and summarizing continuous actions, remains an emerging task. This paper introduces the novel XRF V2 dataset, designed for indoor daily activity Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and action summarization. XRF V2 integrates multimodal data from Wi-Fi signals, IMU sensors (smartphones, smartwatches, headphones, and smart glasses), and synchronized video recordings, offering a diverse collection of indoor activities from 16 volunteers across three distinct environments. To tackle TAL and action summarization, we propose the XRFMamba neural network, which excels at capturing long-term dependencies in untrimmed sensory sequences and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as ActionFormer and WiFiTAD. We envision XRF V2 as a valuable resource for advancing research in human action localization, action forecasting, pose estimation, multimodal foundation models pre-training, synthetic data generation, and more.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation on LiDAR imaging is increasingly gaining attention, as it can provide useful knowledge for perception systems and potential for autonomous driving. However, collecting and labeling real LiDAR data is an expensive and time-consuming task. While datasets such as SemanticKITTI have been manually collected and labeled, the introduction of simulation tools such as CARLA, has enabled the creation of synthetic datasets on demand.   In this work, we present a modified CARLA simulator designed with LiDAR semantic segmentation in mind, with new classes, more consistent object labeling with their counterparts from real datasets such as SemanticKITTI, and the possibility to adjust the object class distribution. Using this tool, we have generated SynthmanticLiDAR, a synthetic dataset for semantic segmentation on LiDAR imaging, designed to be similar to SemanticKITTI, and we evaluate its contribution to the training process of different semantic segmentation algorithms by using a naive transfer learning approach. Our results show that incorporating SynthmanticLiDAR into the training process improves the overall performance of tested algorithms, proving the usefulness of our dataset, and therefore, our adapted CARLA simulator.   The dataset and simulator are available in https://github.com/vpulab/SynthmanticLiDAR.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are typically based on decoder-only or cross-attention architectures. While decoder-only MLLMs outperform their cross-attention counterparts, they require significantly higher computational resources due to extensive self-attention and FFN operations on visual tokens. This raises the question: can we eliminate these expensive operations while maintaining the performance? To this end, we present a novel analysis framework to investigate the necessity of these costly operations in decoder-only MLLMs. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Hollow Attention, which limits visual token interactions to local attention while maintaining visual-text associations, and (2) Probe-Activated Dynamic FFN, which selectively activates FFN parameters for visual tokens. Both methods do not require fine-tuning, which significantly enhances analysis efficiency. To assess the impact of applying these reductions across different proportions of layers, we developed a greedy search method that significantly narrows the search space. Experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that applying our reductions to approximately half of the layers not only maintains but sometimes improves model performance, indicating significant computational redundancy in current architectures. Additionally, our method is orthogonal to existing token compression techniques, allowing for further combination to achieve greater computational reduction. Our findings may provide valuable insights for the design of more efficient future MLLMs. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/L-Hugh/Beyond-Token-Compression.

- **Summary**: The development of image time series retrieval (ITSR) methods is a growing research interest in remote sensing (RS). Given a user-defined image time series (i.e., the query time series), the ITSR methods search and retrieve from large archives the image time series that have similar content to the query time series. The existing ITSR methods in RS are designed for unimodal retrieval problems, limiting their usability and versatility. To overcome this issue, as a first time in RS we introduce the task of cross-modal text-ITSR. In particular, we present a self-supervised cross-modal text-image time series retrieval (text-ITSR) method that enables the retrieval of image time series using text sentences as queries, and vice versa. In detail, we focus our attention on text-ITSR in pairs of images (i.e., bitemporal images). The proposed text-ITSR method consists of two key components: 1) modality-specific encoders to model the semantic content of bitemporal images and text sentences with discriminative features; and 2) modality-specific projection heads to align textual and image representations in a shared embedding space. To effectively model the temporal information within the bitemporal images, we introduce two fusion strategies: i) global feature fusion (GFF) strategy that combines global image features through simple yet effective operators; and ii) transformer-based feature fusion (TFF) strategy that leverages transformers for fine-grained temporal integration. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark RS archives demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately retrieving semantically relevant bitemporal images (or text sentences) to a query text sentence (or bitemporal image).

- **Summary**: To be considered reliable, a model must be calibrated so that its confidence in each decision closely reflects its true outcome. In this blogpost we'll take a look at the most commonly used definition for calibration and then dive into a frequently used evaluation measure for model calibration. We'll then cover some of the drawbacks of this measure and how these surfaced the need for additional notions of calibration, which require their own new evaluation measures. This post is not intended to be an in-depth dissection of all works on calibration, nor does it focus on how to calibrate models. Instead, it is meant to provide a gentle introduction to the different notions and their evaluation measures as well as to re-highlight some issues with a measure that is still widely used to evaluate calibration.

- **Summary**: Whole Slide Imaging (WSI), which involves high-resolution digital scans of pathology slides, has become the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, but its gigapixel resolution and the scarcity of annotated datasets present challenges for deep learning models. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a widely-used weakly supervised approach, bypasses the need for patch-level annotations. However, conventional MIL methods overlook the spatial relationships between patches, which are crucial for tasks such as cancer grading and diagnosis. To address this, graph-based approaches have gained prominence by incorporating spatial information through node connections. Despite their potential, both MIL and graph-based models are vulnerable to learning spurious associations, like color variations in WSIs, affecting their robustness. In this dissertation, we conduct an extensive comparison of multiple graph construction techniques, MIL models, graph-MIL approaches, and interventional training, introducing a new framework, Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning with Interventional Training (GMIL-IT), for WSI classification. We evaluate their impact on model generalization through domain shift analysis and demonstrate that graph-based models alone achieve the generalization initially anticipated from interventional training.

- **Summary**: Creating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models requires significant expertise and effort. Text-to-CAD, which converts textual descriptions into CAD parametric sequences, is crucial in streamlining this process. Recent studies have utilized ground-truth parametric sequences, known as sequential signals, as supervision to achieve this goal. However, CAD models are inherently multimodal, comprising parametric sequences and corresponding rendered visual objects. Besides,the rendering process from parametric sequences to visual objects is many-to-one. Therefore, both sequential and visual signals are critical for effective training. In this work, we introduce CADFusion, a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone and alternates between two training stages: the sequential learning (SL) stage and the visual feedback (VF) stage. In the SL stage, we train LLMs using ground-truth parametric sequences, enabling the generation of logically coherent parametric sequences. In the VF stage, we reward parametric sequences that render into visually preferred objects and penalize those that do not, allowing LLMs to learn how rendered visual objects are perceived and evaluated. These two stages alternate throughout the training, ensuring balanced learning and preserving benefits of both signals. Experiments demonstrate that CADFusion significantly improves performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities and can quickly adapt to downstream tasks through prompt fine-tuning. Unfortunately, in classification tasks involving non-training classes, known as open-vocabulary setting, fine-tuned VLMs often overfit to train classes, resulting in a misalignment between confidence scores and actual accuracy on unseen classes, which significantly undermines their reliability in real-world deployments. Existing confidence calibration methods typically require training parameters or analyzing features from the training dataset, restricting their ability to generalize unseen classes without corresponding train data. Moreover, VLM-specific calibration methods rely solely on text features from train classes as calibration indicators, which inherently limits their ability to calibrate train classes. To address these challenges, we propose an effective multimodal calibration method Contrast-Aware Calibration (CAC). Building on the original CLIP's zero-shot adaptability and the conclusion from empirical analysis that poor intra-class and inter-class discriminative ability on unseen classes is the root cause, we calculate calibration weights based on the contrastive difference between the original and fine-tuned CLIP. This method not only adapts to calibrating unseen classes but also overcomes the limitations of previous VLM calibration methods that could not calibrate train classes. In experiments involving 11 datasets with 5 fine-tuning methods, CAC consistently achieved the best calibration effect on both train and unseen classes without sacrificing accuracy and inference speed.

- **Summary**: When interacting with the real world, human often take the egocentric (first-person) view as a benchmark, naturally transferring behaviors observed from a exocentric (third-person) view to their own. This cognitive theory provides a foundation for researching how robots can more effectively imitate human behavior. However, current research either employs multiple cameras with different views focusing on the same individual's behavior simultaneously or encounters unpair ego-exo view scenarios, there is no effort to fully exploit human cognitive behavior in the real world. To fill this gap, in this paper, we introduce a novel large-scale egocentric dataset, called EgoMe, which towards following the process of human imitation learning via egocentric view in the real world. Our dataset includes 7902 pairs of videos (15804 videos) for diverse daily behaviors in real-world scenarios. For a pair of videos, one video captures a exocentric view of the imitator observing the demonstrator's actions, while the other captures a egocentric view of the imitator subsequently following those actions. Notably, our dataset also contain exo-ego eye gaze, angular velocity, acceleration, magnetic strength and other sensor multi-modal data for assisting in establishing correlations between observing and following process. In addition, we also propose eight challenging benchmark tasks for fully leveraging this data resource and promoting the research of robot imitation learning ability. Extensive statistical analysis demonstrates significant advantages compared to existing datasets. The proposed EgoMe dataset and benchmark will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable progress in text-to-image generative models, they are prone to adversarial attacks and inadvertently generate unsafe, unethical content. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning models to remove specific concepts, which is computationally expensive, lack scalability, and/or compromise generation quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAEs) to enable efficient and interpretable concept manipulation in diffusion models. Specifically, we first identify interpretable monosemantic concepts in the latent space of text embeddings and leverage them to precisely steer the generation away or towards a given concept (e.g., nudity) or to introduce a new concept (e.g., photographic style). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is very simple, requires no retraining of the base model nor LoRA adapters, does not compromise the generation quality, and is robust to adversarial prompt manipulations. Our method yields an improvement of $\mathbf{20.01\%}$ in unsafe concept removal, is effective in style manipulation, and is $\mathbf{\sim5}$x faster than current state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: To bridge the semantic gap between vision and language (VL), it is necessary to develop a good alignment strategy, which includes handling semantic diversity, abstract representation of visual information, and generalization ability of models. Recent works use detector-based bounding boxes or patches with regular partitions to represent visual semantics. While current paradigms have made strides, they are still insufficient for fully capturing the nuanced contextual relations among various objects. This paper proposes a comprehensive visual semantic representation module, necessitating the utilization of panoptic segmentation to generate coherent fine-grained semantic features. Furthermore, we propose a novel Graph Spiking Hybrid Network (GSHN) that integrates the complementary advantages of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to encode visual semantic information. Intriguingly, the model not only encodes the discrete and continuous latent variables of instances but also adeptly captures both local and global contextual features, thereby significantly enhancing the richness and diversity of semantic representations. Leveraging the spatiotemporal properties inherent in SNNs, we employ contrastive learning (CL) to enhance the similarity-based representation of embeddings. This strategy alleviates the computational overhead of the model and enriches meaningful visual representations by constructing positive and negative sample pairs. We design an innovative pre-training method, Spiked Text Learning (STL), which uses text features to improve the encoding ability of discrete semantics. Experiments show that the proposed GSHN exhibits promising results on multiple VL downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have become a popular choice for human motion synthesis due to their powerful generative capabilities. However, their high computational complexity and large sampling steps pose challenges for real-time applications. Fortunately, the Consistency Model (CM) provides a solution to greatly reduce the number of sampling steps from hundreds to a few, typically fewer than four, significantly accelerating the synthesis of diffusion models. However, its application to text-conditioned human motion synthesis in latent space remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{MotionPCM}, a phased consistency model-based approach designed to improve the quality and efficiency of real-time motion synthesis in latent space.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a method that leverages CLIP feature distillation, achieving efficient 3D segmentation through language guidance. Unlike previous methods that rely on multi-scale CLIP features and are limited by processing speed and storage requirements, our approach aims to streamline the workflow by directly and effectively distilling dense CLIP features, thereby achieving precise segmentation of 3D scenes using text. To achieve this, we introduce an adapter module and mitigate the noise issue in the dense CLIP feature distillation process through a self-cross-training strategy. Moreover, to enhance the accuracy of segmentation edges, this work presents a low-rank transient query attention mechanism. To ensure the consistency of segmentation for similar colors under different viewpoints, we convert the segmentation task into a classification task through label volume, which significantly improves the consistency of segmentation in color-similar areas. We also propose a simplified text augmentation strategy to alleviate the issue of ambiguity in the correspondence between CLIP features and text. Extensive experimental results show that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art technologies in both training speed and performance.

- **Summary**: X-ray imaging is pivotal in medical diagnostics, offering non-invasive insights into a range of health conditions. Recently, vision-language models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, have demonstrated potential in improving diagnostic accuracy by leveraging large-scale image-text datasets. However, since CLIP was not initially designed for medical images, several CLIP-like models trained specifically on medical images have been developed. Despite their enhanced performance, issues of fairness - particularly regarding demographic attributes - remain largely unaddressed. In this study, we perform a comprehensive fairness analysis of CLIP-like models applied to X-ray image classification. We assess their performance and fairness across diverse patient demographics and disease categories using zero-shot inference and various fine-tuning techniques, including Linear Probing, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and full fine-tuning. Our results indicate that while fine-tuning improves model accuracy, fairness concerns persist, highlighting the need for further fairness interventions in these foundational models.

- **Summary**: Since hands are the primary interface in daily interactions, modeling high-quality digital human hands and rendering realistic images is a critical research problem. Furthermore, considering the requirements of interactive and rendering applications, it is essential to achieve real-time rendering and driveability of the digital model without compromising rendering quality. Thus, we propose Jointly 3D Gaussian Hand (JGHand), a novel joint-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based hand representation that renders high-fidelity hand images in real-time for various poses and characters. Distinct from existing articulated neural rendering techniques, we introduce a differentiable process for spatial transformations based on 3D key points. This process supports deformations from the canonical template to a mesh with arbitrary bone lengths and poses. Additionally, we propose a real-time shadow simulation method based on per-pixel depth to simulate self-occlusion shadows caused by finger movements. Finally, we embed the hand prior and propose an animatable 3DGS representation of the hand driven solely by 3D key points. We validate the effectiveness of each component of our approach through comprehensive ablation studies. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that JGHand achieves real-time rendering speeds with enhanced quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: It is widely accepted that medical imaging systems should be objectively assessed via task-based image quality (IQ) measures that ideally account for all sources of randomness in the measured image data, including the variation in the ensemble of objects to be imaged. Stochastic object models (SOMs) that can randomly draw samples from the object distribution can be employed to characterize object variability. To establish realistic SOMs for task-based IQ analysis, it is desirable to employ experimental image data. However, experimental image data acquired from medical imaging systems are subject to measurement noise. Previous work investigated the ability of deep generative models (DGMs) that employ an augmented generative adversarial network (GAN), AmbientGAN, for establishing SOMs from noisy measured image data. Recently, denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have emerged as a leading DGM for image synthesis and can produce superior image quality than GANs. However, original DDMs possess a slow image-generation process because of the Gaussian assumption in the denoising steps. More recently, denoising diffusion GAN (DDGAN) was proposed to permit fast image generation while maintain high generated image quality that is comparable to the original DDMs. In this work, we propose an augmented DDGAN architecture, Ambient DDGAN (ADDGAN), for learning SOMs from noisy image data. Numerical studies that consider clinical computed tomography (CT) images and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images are conducted. The ability of the proposed ADDGAN to learn realistic SOMs from noisy image data is demonstrated. It has been shown that the ADDGAN significantly outperforms the advanced AmbientGAN models for synthesizing high resolution medical images with complex textures.

- **Summary**: Current video-language models struggle with long-video understanding due to limited context lengths and reliance on sparse frame subsampling, often leading to information loss. This paper introduces $\infty$-Video, which can process arbitrarily long videos through a continuous-time long-term memory (LTM) consolidation mechanism. Our framework augments video Q-formers by allowing them to process unbounded video contexts efficiently and without requiring additional training. Through continuous attention, our approach dynamically allocates higher granularity to the most relevant video segments, forming "sticky" memories that evolve over time. Experiments with Video-LLaMA and VideoChat2 demonstrate improved performance in video question-answering tasks, showcasing the potential of continuous-time LTM mechanisms to enable scalable and training-free comprehension of long videos.

- **Summary**: Micro-expression recognition plays a pivotal role in understanding hidden emotions and has applications across various fields. Traditional recognition methods assume access to all training data at once, but real-world scenarios involve continuously evolving data streams. To respond to the requirement of adapting to new data while retaining previously learned knowledge, we introduce the first benchmark specifically designed for incremental micro-expression recognition. Our contributions include: Firstly, we formulate the incremental learning setting tailored for micro-expression recognition. Secondly, we organize sequential datasets with carefully curated learning orders to reflect real-world scenarios. Thirdly, we define two cross-evaluation-based testing protocols, each targeting distinct evaluation objectives. Finally, we provide six baseline methods and their corresponding evaluation results. This benchmark lays the groundwork for advancing incremental micro-expression recognition research. All source code used in this study will be publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengQinLai/IMER-benchmark.

- **Summary**: This study focuses on the classification of cancerous and healthy slices from multimodal lung images. The data used in the research comprises Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images. The proposed strategy achieves the fusion of PET and CT images by utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and an Autoencoder. Subsequently, a new ensemble-based classifier developed, Deep Ensembled Multimodal Fusion (DEMF), employing majority voting to classify the sample images under examination. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) employed to visualize the classification accuracy of cancer-affected images. Given the limited sample size, a random image augmentation strategy employed during the training phase. The DEMF network helps mitigate the challenges of scarce data in computer-aided medical image analysis. The proposed network compared with state-of-the-art networks across three publicly available datasets. The network outperforms others based on the metrics - Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall. The investigation results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed network.

- **Summary**: Event-guided imaging has received significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize instant imaging systems. However, the prior methods primarily focus on enhancing RGB images in a post-processing manner, neglecting the challenges of image signal processor (ISP) dealing with event sensor and the benefits events provide for reforming the ISP process. To achieve this, we conduct the first research on event-guided ISP. First, we present a new event-RAW paired dataset, collected with a novel but still confidential sensor that records pixel-level aligned events and RAW images. This dataset includes 3373 RAW images with 2248 x 3264 resolution and their corresponding events, spanning 24 scenes with 3 exposure modes and 3 lenses. Second, we propose a conventional ISP pipeline to generate good RGB frames as reference. This conventional ISP pipleline performs basic ISP operations, e.g.demosaicing, white balancing, denoising and color space transforming, with a ColorChecker as reference. Third, we classify the existing learnable ISP methods into 3 classes, and select multiple methods to train and evaluate on our new dataset. Lastly, since there is no prior work for reference, we propose a simple event-guided ISP method and test it on our dataset. We further put forward key technical challenges and future directions in RGB-Event ISP. In summary, to the best of our knowledge, this is the very first research focusing on event-guided ISP, and we hope it will inspire the community. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/yunfanLu/RGB-Event-ISP.

- **Summary**: As the cornerstone of artificial intelligence, machine perception confronts a fundamental threat posed by adversarial illusions. These adversarial attacks manifest in two primary forms: deductive illusion, where specific stimuli are crafted based on the victim model's general decision logic, and inductive illusion, where the victim model's general decision logic is shaped by specific stimuli. The former exploits the model's decision boundaries to create a stimulus that, when applied, interferes with its decision-making process. The latter reinforces a conditioned reflex in the model, embedding a backdoor during its learning phase that, when triggered by a stimulus, causes aberrant behaviours. The multifaceted nature of adversarial illusions calls for a unified defence framework, addressing vulnerabilities across various forms of attack. In this study, we propose a disillusion paradigm based on the concept of an imitation game. At the heart of the imitation game lies a multimodal generative agent, steered by chain-of-thought reasoning, which observes, internalises and reconstructs the semantic essence of a sample, liberated from the classic pursuit of reversing the sample to its original state. As a proof of concept, we conduct experimental simulations using a multimodal generative dialogue agent and evaluates the methodology under a variety of attack scenarios.

- **Summary**: In multi-label learning, leveraging contrastive learning to learn better representations faces a key challenge: selecting positive and negative samples and effectively utilizing label information. Previous studies selected positive and negative samples based on the overlap between labels and used them for label-wise loss balancing. However, these methods suffer from a complex selection process and fail to account for the varying importance of different labels. To address these problems, we propose a novel method that improves multi-label contrastive learning through label distribution. Specifically, when selecting positive and negative samples, we only need to consider whether there is an intersection between labels. To model the relationships between labels, we introduce two methods to recover label distributions from logical labels, based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) and contrastive loss, respectively. We evaluate our method on nine widely used multi-label datasets, including image and vector datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in six evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Stroke is globally a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and hence accurate and rapid diagnosis of stroke is valuable. Retinal fundus imaging reveals the known markers of elevated stroke risk in the eyes, which are retinal venular widening, arteriolar narrowing, and increased tortuosity. In contrast to other imaging techniques used for stroke diagnosis, the acquisition of fundus images is easy, non-invasive, fast, and inexpensive. Therefore, in this study, we propose a multi-view stroke network (MVS-Net) to detect stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) using retinal fundus images. Contrary to existing studies, our study proposes for the first time a solution to discriminate stroke and TIA with deep multi-view learning by proposing an end-to-end deep network, consisting of multi-view inputs of fundus images captured from both right and left eyes. Accordingly, the proposed MVS-Net defines representative features from fundus images of both eyes and determines the relation within their macula-centered and optic nerve head-centered views. Experiments performed on a dataset collected from stroke and TIA patients, in addition to healthy controls, show that the proposed framework achieves an AUC score of 0.84 for stroke and TIA detection.

- **Summary**: Domain shifts are critical issues that harm the performance of machine learning. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) mitigates this issue but suffers when the domain shifts are steep and drastic. Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA) alleviates this problem in a mild way by gradually adapting from the source to the target domain using multiple intermediate domains. In this paper, we propose Sliding Window Adversarial Training (SWAT) for Gradual Domain Adaptation. SWAT uses the construction of adversarial streams to connect the feature spaces of the source and target domains. In order to gradually narrow the small gap between adjacent intermediate domains, a sliding window paradigm is designed that moves along the adversarial stream. When the window moves to the end of the stream, i.e., the target domain, the domain shift is drastically reduced. Extensive experiments are conducted on public GDA benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that the proposed SWAT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a new method called Gradual Domain Osmosis, which aims to solve the problem of smooth knowledge migration from source domain to target domain in Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA). Traditional Gradual Domain Adaptation methods mitigate domain bias by introducing intermediate domains and self-training strategies, but often face the challenges of inefficient knowledge migration or missing data in intermediate domains. In this paper, we design an optimisation framework based on the hyperparameter $\lambda$ by dynamically balancing the loss weights of the source and target domains, which enables the model to progressively adjust the strength of knowledge migration ($\lambda$ incrementing from 0 to 1) during the training process, thus achieving cross-domain generalisation more efficiently. Specifically, the method incorporates self-training to generate pseudo-labels and iteratively updates the model by minimising a weighted loss function to ensure stability and robustness during progressive adaptation in the intermediate domain. The experimental part validates the effectiveness of the method on rotated MNIST, colour-shifted MNIST, portrait dataset and forest cover type dataset, and the results show that it outperforms existing baseline methods. The paper further analyses the impact of the dynamic tuning strategy of the hyperparameter $\lambda$ on the performance through ablation experiments, confirming the advantages of progressive domain penetration in mitigating the domain bias and enhancing the model generalisation capability. The study provides a theoretical support and practical framework for asymptotic domain adaptation and expands its application potential in dynamic environments.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, the efficient utilization of spectrum resources, optimization of communication quality, and intelligent communication have become critical. Radio map reconstruction is essential for enabling advanced applications, yet challenges such as complex signal propagation and sparse data hinder accurate reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose the **Radio Map Diffusion Model (RMDM)**, a physics-informed framework that integrates **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to incorporate constraints like the **Helmholtz equation**. RMDM employs a dual U-Net architecture: the first ensures physical consistency by minimizing PDE residuals, boundary conditions, and source constraints, while the second refines predictions via diffusion-based denoising. By leveraging physical laws, RMDM significantly enhances accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that RMDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving **NMSE of 0.0031** and **RMSE of 0.0125** under the Static RM (SRM) setting, and **NMSE of 0.0047** and **RMSE of 0.0146** under the Dynamic RM (DRM) setting. These results establish a novel paradigm for integrating physics-informed and data-driven approaches in radio map reconstruction, particularly under sparse data conditions.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with visual perception capabilities, enabling them to process and interpret visual information. A major challenge compromising their reliability is object hallucination that LVMs may generate plausible but factually inaccurate information. We propose a novel visual adversarial perturbation (VAP) method to mitigate this hallucination issue. VAP alleviates LVM hallucination by applying strategically optimized visual noise without altering the base model. Our approach formulates hallucination suppression as an optimization problem, leveraging adversarial strategies to generate beneficial visual perturbations that enhance the model's factual grounding and reduce parametric knowledge bias. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently reduces object hallucinations across 8 state-of-the-art LVMs, validating its efficacy across diverse evaluations.

- **Summary**: Full-Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) is the primary imaging modality for routine breast cancer screening; however, its effectiveness is limited in patients with dense breast tissue or fibrocystic conditions. Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM), a second-level imaging technique, offers enhanced accuracy in tumor detection. Nonetheless, its application is restricted due to higher radiation exposure, the use of contrast agents, and limited accessibility. As a result, CESM is typically reserved for select cases, leaving many patients to rely solely on FFDM despite the superior diagnostic performance of CESM. While biopsy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, it is an invasive procedure that can cause discomfort for patients. We introduce a multimodal, multi-view deep learning approach for virtual biopsy, integrating FFDM and CESM modalities in craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views to classify lesions as malignant or benign. To address the challenge of missing CESM data, we leverage generative artificial intelligence to impute CESM images from FFDM scans. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating the CESM modality is crucial to enhance the performance of virtual biopsy. When real CESM data is missing, synthetic CESM images proved effective, outperforming the use of FFDM alone, particularly in multimodal configurations that combine FFDM and CESM modalities. The proposed approach has the potential to improve diagnostic workflows, providing clinicians with augmented intelligence tools to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. Additionally, as a contribution to the research community, we publicly release the dataset used in our experiments, facilitating further advancements in this field.

- **Summary**: Object counting has recently shifted towards class-agnostic counting (CAC), which addresses the challenge of counting objects across arbitrary categories, tackling a critical need in versatile counting systems. While humans effortlessly identify and count objects from diverse categories without prior knowledge, most counting methods remain restricted to enumerating instances of known classes, requiring extensive labeled datasets for training, and struggling under open-vocabulary settings. Conversely, CAC aims to count objects belonging to classes never seen during training, typically operating in a few-shot setting. In this paper, for the first time, we review advancements in CAC methodologies, categorizing them into three paradigms based on how target object classes can be specified: reference-based, reference-less, and open-world text-guided. Reference-based approaches have set performance benchmarks using exemplar-guided mechanisms. Reference-less methods eliminate exemplar dependency by leveraging inherent image patterns. Finally, open-world text-guided methods utilize vision-language models, enabling object class descriptions through textual prompts, representing a flexible and appealing solution. We analyze state-of-the-art techniques and we report their results on existing gold standard benchmarks, comparing their performance and identifying and discussing their strengths and limitations. Persistent challenges -- such as annotation dependency, scalability, and generalization -- are discussed, alongside future directions. We believe this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers to understand the progressive developments and contributions over time and the current state-of-the-art of CAC, suggesting insights for future directions and challenges to be addressed.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a process that enables the direct creation of 3D objects from 2D images. This representation offers numerous advantages, including rapid training and rendering. However, a significant limitation of 3DGS is the challenge of incorporating light and shadow reflections, primarily due to the utilization of rasterization rather than ray tracing for rendering. This paper introduces RaySplats, a model that employs ray-tracing based Gaussian Splatting. Rather than utilizing the projection of Gaussians, our method employs a ray-tracing mechanism, operating directly on Gaussian primitives represented by confidence ellipses with RGB colors. In practice, we compute the intersection between ellipses and rays to construct ray-tracing algorithms, facilitating the incorporation of meshes with Gaussian Splatting models and the addition of lights, shadows, and other related effects.

- **Summary**: Epithelial cells form diverse structures from squamous spherical organoids to densely packed pseudostratified tissues. Quantification of cellular properties in these contexts requires high-resolution deep imaging and computational techniques to achieve truthful three-dimensional (3D) structural features. Here, we describe a detailed step-by-step protocol for sample preparation, imaging and deep-learning-assisted cell segmentation to achieve accurate quantification of fluorescently labelled individual cells in 3D within live tissues. We share the lessons learned through troubleshooting 3D imaging of Drosophila wing discs, including considerations on the choice of microscopy modality and settings (objective, sample mounting) and available segmentation methods. In addition, we include a computational pipeline alongside custom code to assist replication of the protocol. While we focus on the segmentation of cell outlines from membrane labelling, this protocol applies to a wide variety of samples, and we believe it be valuable for studying other tissues that demand complex analysis in 3D.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel active learning approach integrated with an improved semi-supervised learning framework to reduce the cost of manual annotation and enhance model performance. Our proposed approach effectively leverages both the labelled data selected through active learning and the unlabelled data excluded from the selection process. The proposed active learning approach pinpoints areas where the pseudo-labels are likely to be inaccurate. Then, an automatic and efficient pseudo-label auto-refinement (PLAR) module is proposed to correct pixels with potentially erroneous pseudo-labels by comparing their feature representations with those of labelled regions. This approach operates without increasing the labelling budget and is based on the cluster assumption, which states that pixels belonging to the same class should exhibit similar representations in feature space. Furthermore, manual labelling is only applied to the most difficult and uncertain areas in unlabelled data, where insufficient information prevents the PLAR module from making a decision. We evaluated the proposed hybrid semi-supervised active learning framework on two benchmark datasets, one from natural and the other from remote sensing imagery domains. In both cases, it outperformed state-of-the-art methods in the semantic segmentation task.

- **Summary**: The Cerrado faces increasing environmental pressures, necessitating accurate land use and land cover (LULC) mapping despite challenges such as class imbalance and visually similar categories. To address this, we present CerraData-4MM, a multimodal dataset combining Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imagery (MSI) with 10m spatial resolution. The dataset includes two hierarchical classification levels with 7 and 14 classes, respectively, focusing on the diverse Bico do Papagaio ecoregion. We highlight CerraData-4MM's capacity to benchmark advanced semantic segmentation techniques by evaluating a standard U-Net and a more sophisticated Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The ViT achieves superior performance in multimodal scenarios, with the highest macro F1-score of 57.60% and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 49.05% at the first hierarchical level. Both models struggle with minority classes, particularly at the second hierarchical level, where U-Net's performance drops to an F1-score of 18.16%. Class balancing improves representation for underrepresented classes but reduces overall accuracy, underscoring the trade-off in weighted training. CerraData-4MM offers a challenging benchmark for advancing deep learning models to handle class imbalance and multimodal data fusion. Code, trained models, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ai4luc/CerraData-4MM.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) is a crucial method for content generation. However, it needs a lot of time to sample. Many studies have attempted to use caching to reduce the time consumption of sampling. Existing caching methods accelerate generation by reusing DiT features from the previous time step and skipping calculations in the next, but they tend to locate and cache low-error modules without focusing on reducing caching-induced errors, resulting in a sharp decline in generated content quality when increasing caching intensity. To solve this problem, we propose the Error-Optimized Cache (EOC). This method introduces three key improvements: (1) Prior knowledge extraction: Extract and process the caching differences; (2) A judgment method for cache optimization: Determine whether certain caching steps need to be optimized; (3) Cache optimization: reduce caching errors. Experiments show that this algorithm significantly reduces the error accumulation caused by caching (especially over-caching). On the ImageNet dataset, without significantly increasing the computational burden, this method improves the quality of the generated images under the over-caching, rule-based, and training-based methods. Specifically, the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) values are improved as follows: from 6.857 to 5.821, from 3.870 to 3.692 and form 3.539 to 3.451 respectively.

- **Summary**: The remarkable progress in text-to-video diffusion models enables photorealistic generations, although the contents of the generated video often include unnatural movement or deformation, reverse playback, and motionless scenes. Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some quantity on the goodness of the content. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward, at inference time. We then point out that the improvement of perceptual video quality considering the alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. When evaluating outputs by using vision language models as a proxy of humans, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with evaluation and also depend on the degree of dynamic descriptions in evaluation prompts. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality based on the calibrated reward, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling. We provide practical guidelines on which axes, among search budget, lookahead steps for reward estimate, and denoising steps, in the reverse diffusion process, we should allocate the inference-time computation.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation assigns labels to pixels in images, a critical yet challenging task in computer vision. Convolutional methods, although capturing local dependencies well, struggle with long-range relationships. Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in global context capture but are hindered by high computational demands, especially for high-resolution inputs. Most research optimizes the encoder architecture, leaving the bottleneck underexplored - a key area for enhancing performance and efficiency. We propose ContextFormer, a hybrid framework leveraging the strengths of CNNs and ViTs in the bottleneck to balance efficiency, accuracy, and robustness for real-time semantic segmentation. The framework's efficiency is driven by three synergistic modules: the Token Pyramid Extraction Module (TPEM) for hierarchical multi-scale representation, the Transformer and Modulating DepthwiseConv (Trans-MDC) block for dynamic scale-aware feature modeling, and the Feature Merging Module (FMM) for robust integration with enhanced spatial and contextual consistency. Extensive experiments on ADE20K, Pascal Context, CityScapes, and COCO-Stuff datasets show ContextFormer significantly outperforms existing models, achieving state-of-the-art mIoU scores, setting a new benchmark for efficiency and performance. The codes will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: The integration of human-intuitive interactions into autonomous systems has been limited. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems struggle with context and intent understanding, severely restricting human-robot interaction. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed this dynamic, allowing for intuitive and high-level communication through speech and text, and bridging the gap between human commands and robotic actions. Additionally, autonomous navigation has emerged as a central focus in robotics research, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly being leveraged to enhance these systems. However, existing AI-based navigation algorithms face significant challenges in latency-critical tasks where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional frame-based vision systems, while effective for high-level decision-making, suffer from high energy consumption and latency, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. Neuromorphic vision systems, combining event-based cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs), offer a promising alternative by enabling energy-efficient, low-latency navigation. Despite their potential, real-world implementations of these systems, particularly on physical platforms such as drones, remain scarce. In this work, we present Neuro-LIFT, a real-time neuromorphic navigation framework implemented on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor. Leveraging an LLM for natural language processing, Neuro-LIFT translates human speech into high-level planning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based neuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning. Our framework demonstrates its capabilities in navigating in a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to human instructions in real-time.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning have shown that learning robust feature representations is critical for the success of many computer vision tasks, including medical image segmentation. In particular, both transformer and convolutional-based architectures have benefit from leveraging pretext tasks for pretraining. However, the adoption of pretext tasks in 3D medical imaging has been less explored and remains a challenge, especially in the context of learning generalizable feature representations.   We propose a novel pretraining strategy using diffusion models with anatomical guidance, tailored to the intricacies of 3D medical image data. We introduce an auxiliary diffusion process to pretrain a model that produce generalizable feature representations, useful for a variety of downstream segmentation tasks. We employ an additional model that predicts 3D universal body-part coordinates, providing guidance during the diffusion process and improving spatial awareness in generated representations. This approach not only aids in resolving localization inaccuracies but also enriches the model's ability to understand complex anatomical structures.   Empirical validation on a 13-class organ segmentation task demonstrate the effectiveness of our pretraining technique. It surpasses existing restorative pretraining methods in 3D medical image segmentation by $7.5\%$, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art contrastive pretraining approach, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 67.8 in a non-linear evaluation scenario.

- **Summary**: Point cloud completion aims to recover the completed 3D shape of an object from its partial observation caused by occlusion, sensor's limitation, noise, etc. When some key semantic information is lost in the incomplete point cloud, the neural network needs to infer the missing part based on the input information. Intuitively we would apply an autoencoder architecture to solve this kind of problem, which take the incomplete point cloud as input and is supervised by the ground truth. This process that develops model's imagination from incomplete shape to complete shape is done automatically in the latent space. But the knowledge for mapping from incomplete to complete still remains dark and could be further explored. Motivated by the knowledge distillation's teacher-student learning strategy, we design a knowledge transfer way for completing 3d shape. In this work, we propose a novel View Distillation Point Completion Network (VD-PCN), which solve the completion problem by a multi-view distillation way. The design methodology fully leverages the orderliness of 2d pixels, flexibleness of 2d processing and powerfulness of 2d network. Extensive evaluations on PCN, ShapeNet55/34, and MVP datasets confirm the effectiveness of our design and knowledge transfer strategy, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Committed to facilitate ongoing research, we will make our code publicly available.

- **Summary**: Training a neural network for pixel based classification task using low resolution Landsat images is difficult as the size of the training data is usually small due to less number of available pixels that represent a single class without any mixing with other classes. Due to this scarcity of training data, neural network may not be able to attain expected level of accuracy. This limitation could be overcome using a generative network that aims to generate synthetic data having the same distribution as the sample data with which it is trained. In this work, we have proposed a methodology for improving the performance of ANN classifier to identify built-up pixels in the Landsat$7$ image with the help of developing a simple GAN architecture that could generate synthetic training pixels when trained using original set of sample built-up pixels. To ensure that the marginal and joint distributions of all the bands corresponding to the generated and original set of pixels are indistinguishable, non-parametric Kolmogorov Smirnov Test and Ball Divergence based Equality of Distributions Test have been performed respectively. It has been observed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the ANN model for built-up classification have continuously improved from $0.9331$ to $0.9983$ and $0.8277$ to $0.9958$ respectively, with the inclusion of generated sets of built-up pixels to the original one.

- **Summary**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for precise surgical interventions and robotic tasks in minimally invasive procedures. While recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved SLAM with high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering, these systems struggle with accurate depth and surface reconstruction due to multi-view inconsistencies. Simply incorporating SLAM and 3DGS leads to mismatches between the reconstructed frames. In this work, we present Endo-2DTAM, a real-time endoscopic SLAM system with 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) to address these challenges. Endo-2DTAM incorporates a surface normal-aware pipeline, which consists of tracking, mapping, and bundle adjustment modules for geometrically accurate reconstruction. Our robust tracking module combines point-to-point and point-to-plane distance metrics, while the mapping module utilizes normal consistency and depth distortion to enhance surface reconstruction quality. We also introduce a pose-consistent strategy for efficient and geometrically coherent keyframe sampling. Extensive experiments on public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that Endo-2DTAM achieves an RMSE of $1.87\pm 0.63$ mm for depth reconstruction of surgical scenes while maintaining computationally efficient tracking, high-quality visual appearance, and real-time rendering. Our code will be released at github.com/lastbasket/Endo-2DTAM.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a versatile hybrid framework for addressing 2D real-world reconstruction tasks formulated as jigsaw puzzle problems (JPPs) with square, non-overlapping pieces. Our approach integrates a deep learning (DL)-based compatibility measure (CM) model that evaluates pairs of puzzle pieces holistically, rather than focusing solely on their adjacent edges as traditionally done. This DL-based CM is paired with an optimized genetic algorithm (GA)-based solver, which iteratively searches for a global optimal arrangement using the pairwise CM scores of the puzzle pieces. Extensive experimental results highlight the framework's adaptability and robustness across multiple real-world domains. Notably, our unique hybrid methodology achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in reconstructing Portuguese tile panels and large degraded puzzles with eroded boundaries.

- **Summary**: With the rise in global greenhouse gas emissions, accurate large-scale tree canopy height maps are essential for understanding forest structure, estimating above-ground biomass, and monitoring ecological disruptions. To this end, we present a novel approach to generate large-scale, high-resolution canopy height maps over time. Our model accurately predicts canopy height over multiple years given Sentinel-2 time series satellite data. Using GEDI LiDAR data as the ground truth for training the model, we present the first 10m resolution temporal canopy height map of the European continent for the period 2019-2022. As part of this product, we also offer a detailed canopy height map for 2020, providing more precise estimates than previous studies. Our pipeline and the resulting temporal height map are publicly available, enabling comprehensive large-scale monitoring of forests and, hence, facilitating future research and ecological analyses.

- **Summary**: Sketches, with their expressive potential, allow humans to convey the essence of an object through even a rough contour. For the first time, we harness this expressive potential to improve segmentation performance in challenging tasks like camouflaged object detection (COD). Our approach introduces an innovative sketch-guided interactive segmentation framework, allowing users to intuitively annotate objects with freehand sketches (drawing a rough contour of the object) instead of the traditional bounding boxes or points used in classic interactive segmentation models like SAM. We demonstrate that sketch input can significantly improve performance in existing iterative segmentation methods, outperforming text or bounding box annotations. Additionally, we introduce key modifications to network architectures and a novel sketch augmentation technique to fully harness the power of sketch input and further boost segmentation accuracy. Remarkably, our model' s output can be directly used to train other neural networks, achieving results comparable to pixel-by-pixel annotations--while reducing annotation time by up to 120 times, which shows great potential in democratizing the annotation process and enabling model training with less reliance on resource-intensive, laborious pixel-level annotations. We also present KOSCamo+, the first freehand sketch dataset for camouflaged object detection. The dataset, code, and the labeling tool will be open sourced.

- **Summary**: Colorization is a traditional computer vision task and it plays an important role in many time-consuming tasks, such as old film restoration. Existing methods suffer from unsaturated color and temporally inconsistency. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline to overcome the challenges. We regard the colorization task as a generative task and introduce Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) as our base model. We design a palette-based color guider to assist the model in generating vivid and consistent colors. The color context introduced by the palette not only provides guidance for color generation, but also enhances the stability of the generated colors through a unified color context across multiple sequences. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can provide vivid and stable colors for videos, surpassing previous methods.

- **Summary**: Prior research show that Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) represent marginalized groups more homogeneously than dominant groups. However, the mechanisms underlying this homogeneity bias remain relatively unexplored. We propose that this bias emerges from systematic differences in the probability distributions from which tokens are sampled at inference-time. Analyzing three measures of uncertainty in token sampling distributions-entropy, perplexity, and probability of differentiation-we find that in some models, specifically GPT-4 Turbo and Llama-3.2, tokens are sampled more deterministically when generating texts about marginalized groups (i.e., Black Americans and women) compared to their dominant group counterparts (i.e., White Americans and men). While these findings may help explain homogeneity bias in certain models, the patterns did not replicate across all VLMs tested, suggesting multiple mechanisms may contribute to homogeneity bias in AI.

- **Summary**: Developing new methods for the automated analysis of clinical fetal and neonatal MRI data is limited by the scarcity of annotated pathological datasets and privacy concerns that often restrict data sharing, hindering the effectiveness of deep learning models. We address this in two ways. First, we introduce Fetal&Neonatal-DDPM, a novel diffusion model framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic pathological fetal and neonatal MRIs from semantic label images. Second, we enhance training data by modifying healthy label images through morphological alterations to simulate conditions such as ventriculomegaly, cerebellar and pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and microcephaly. By leveraging Fetal&Neonatal-DDPM, we synthesize realistic pathological MRIs from these modified pathological label images. Radiologists rated the synthetic MRIs as significantly (p < 0.05) superior in quality and diagnostic value compared to real MRIs, demonstrating features such as blood vessels and choroid plexus, and improved alignment with label annotations. Synthetic pathological data enhanced state-of-the-art nnUNet segmentation performance, particularly for severe ventriculomegaly cases, with the greatest improvements achieved in ventricle segmentation (Dice scores: 0.9253 vs. 0.7317). This study underscores the potential of generative AI as transformative tool for data augmentation, offering improved segmentation performance in pathological cases. This development represents a significant step towards improving analysis and segmentation accuracy in prenatal imaging, and also offers new ways for data anonymization through the generation of pathologic image data.

- **Summary**: Existing foundation models typically process visual input as pixels and textual input as tokens, a paradigm that contrasts with human perception, where both modalities are processed in a unified manner. With the rise of embodied and agentic AI, where inputs primarily come from camera pixels, the need for a unified perception framework becomes increasingly evident. In this paper, we propose to unify all modalities (text, tables, code, diagrams, images, etc) as pixel inputs, i.e. "Perceive Everything as Pixels" (PEAP). We introduce PixelWorld, a novel evaluation suite that unifies all the mentioned modalities into pixel space to gauge the existing models' performance. Our findings show that (1) PEAP outperforms baseline with token-based input in multimodal datasets, benefiting from unified input for better disambiguation, (2) significant declines in reasoning and coding capabilities across all models when processing pixel-based input, underscoring the need to enhance foundation models' perceptual abilities, (3) larger models can maintain strong performance on non-reasoning tasks under PEAP, while smaller models like Phi-3.5-V suffer significant performance degradation, (4) the attention pattern of PEAP is highly aligned with text token input, (5) PEAP can be accelerated significantly by exploiting the spatial sparsity. We conclude that the existing frontier models are competent in pixel perception, however, there is still headroom for improvement. Our code, dataset will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Since the SCICAP datasets launch in 2021, the research community has made significant progress in generating captions for scientific figures in scholarly articles. In 2023, the first SCICAP Challenge took place, inviting global teams to use an expanded SCICAP dataset to develop models for captioning diverse figure types across various academic fields. At the same time, text generation models advanced quickly, with many powerful pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) emerging that showed impressive capabilities in various vision-and-language tasks. This paper presents an overview of the first SCICAP Challenge and details the performance of various models on its data, capturing a snapshot of the fields state. We found that professional editors overwhelmingly preferred figure captions generated by GPT-4V over those from all other models and even the original captions written by authors. Following this key finding, we conducted detailed analyses to answer this question: Have advanced LMMs solved the task of generating captions for scientific figures?

- **Summary**: It is widely accepted that the Bayesian ideal observer (IO) should be used to guide the objective assessment and optimization of medical imaging systems. The IO employs complete task-specific information to compute test statistics for making inference decisions and performs optimally in signal detection tasks. However, the IO test statistic typically depends non-linearly on the image data and cannot be analytically determined. The ideal linear observer, known as the Hotelling observer (HO), can sometimes be used as a surrogate for the IO. However, when image data are high dimensional, HO computation can be difficult. Efficient channels that can extract task-relevant features have been investigated to reduce the dimensionality of image data to approximate IO and HO performance. This work proposes a novel method for generating efficient channels by use of the gradient of a Lagrangian-based loss function that was designed to learn the HO. The generated channels are referred to as the Lagrangian-gradient (L-grad) channels. Numerical studies are conducted that consider binary signal detection tasks involving various backgrounds and signals. It is demonstrated that channelized HO (CHO) using L-grad channels can produce significantly better signal detection performance compared to the CHO using PLS channels. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed L-grad method can achieve significantly lower computation time compared to the PLS method.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel loop closure detection algorithm that uses graph attention neural networks to encode semantic graphs to perform place recognition and then use semantic registration to estimate the 6 DoF relative pose constraint. Our place recognition algorithm has two key modules, namely, a semantic graph encoder module and a graph comparison module. The semantic graph encoder employs graph attention networks to efficiently encode spatial, semantic and geometric information from the semantic graph of the input point cloud. We then use self-attention mechanism in both node-embedding and graph-embedding steps to create distinctive graph vectors. The graph vectors of the current scan and a keyframe scan are then compared in the graph comparison module to identify a possible loop closure. Specifically, employing the difference of the two graph vectors showed a significant improvement in performance, as shown in ablation studies. Lastly, we implemented a semantic registration algorithm that takes in loop closure candidate scans and estimates the relative 6 DoF pose constraint for the LiDAR SLAM system. Extensive evaluation on public datasets shows that our model is more accurate and robust, achieving 13% improvement in maximum F1 score on the SemanticKITTI dataset, when compared to the baseline semantic graph algorithm. For the benefit of the community, we open-source the complete implementation of our proposed algorithm and custom implementation of semantic registration at https://github.com/crepuscularlight/SemanticLoopClosure

- **Summary**: Rotating synthetic aperture (RSA) imaging system captures images of the target scene at different rotation angles by rotating a rectangular aperture. Deblurring acquired RSA images plays a critical role in reconstructing a latent sharp image underlying the scene. In the past decade, the emergence of blind convolution technology has revolutionised this field by its ability to model complex features from acquired images. Most of the existing methods attempt to solve the above ill-posed inverse problem through maximising a posterior.   Despite this progress, researchers have paid limited attention to exploring low-dimensional manifold structures of the latent image within a high-dimensional ambient-space. Here, we propose a novel method to process RSA images using manifold fitting and penalisation in the content of multi-frame blind convolution. We develop fast algorithms for implementing the proposed procedure. Simulation studies demonstrate that manifold-based deconvolution can outperform conventional deconvolution algorithms in the sense that it can generate a sharper estimate of the latent image in terms of estimating pixel intensities and preserving structural details.

- **Summary**: Amid the swift progress of large language models (LLMs) and their evolution into large multimodal models (LMMs), significant strides have been made in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. While Arabic LLMs have seen notable progress, Arabic LMMs remain largely unexplored, often narrowly focusing on a few specific aspects of the language and visual understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIN-the Arabic Inclusive Multimodal Model-designed to excel across diverse domains. AIN is an English-Arabic bilingual LMM designed to excel in English and Arabic, leveraging carefully constructed 3.6 million high-quality Arabic-English multimodal data samples. AIN demonstrates state-of-the-art Arabic performance, while also possessing strong English-language visual capabilities. On the recent CAMEL-Bench benchmark comprising 38 sub-domains including, multi-image understanding, complex visual perception, handwritten document understanding, video understanding, medical imaging, plant diseases, and remote sensing-based land use understanding, our AIN demonstrates strong performance with the 7B model outperforming GPT-4o by an absolute gain of 3.4% averaged over eight domains and 38 sub-domains. AIN's superior capabilities position it as a significant step toward empowering Arabic speakers with advanced multimodal generative AI tools across diverse applications.

- **Summary**: Hand-drawn maps can be used to convey navigation instructions between humans and robots in a natural and efficient manner. However, these maps can often contain inaccuracies such as scale distortions and missing landmarks which present challenges for mobile robot navigation. This paper introduces a novel Hand-drawn Map Navigation (HAM-Nav) architecture that leverages pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for robot navigation across diverse environments, hand-drawing styles, and robot embodiments, even in the presence of map inaccuracies. HAM-Nav integrates a unique Selective Visual Association Prompting approach for topological map-based position estimation and navigation planning as well as a Predictive Navigation Plan Parser to infer missing landmarks. Extensive experiments were conducted in photorealistic simulated environments, using both wheeled and legged robots, demonstrating the effectiveness of HAM-Nav in terms of navigation success rates and Success weighted by Path Length. Furthermore, a user study in real-world environments highlighted the practical utility of hand-drawn maps for robot navigation as well as successful navigation outcomes.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration refers to the problem of finding the rigid transformation that aligns two given point clouds, and is crucial for many applications in robotics and computer vision. The main insight of this paper is that we can directly optimize the point cloud registration problem without correspondences by utilizing an algorithmically simple, yet computationally complex, semi-exhaustive search approach that is very well-suited for parallelization on modern GPUs. Our proposed algorithm, Direct Semi-Exhaustive Search (DSES), iterates over potential rotation matrices and efficiently computes the inlier-maximizing translation associated with each rotation. It then computes the optimal rigid transformation based on any desired distance metric by directly computing the error associated with each transformation candidate $\{R, t\}$. By leveraging the parallelism of modern GPUs, DSES outperforms state-of-the-art methods for partial-to-full point cloud registration on the simulated ModelNet40 benchmark and demonstrates high performance and robustness for pose estimation on a real-world robotics problem (https://youtu.be/q0q2-s2KSuA).

- **Summary**: The cuneiform writing system served as the medium for transmitting knowledge in the ancient Near East for a period of over three thousand years. Cuneiform signs have a complex internal structure which is the subject of expert paleographic analysis, as variations in sign shapes bear witness to historical developments and transmission of writing and culture over time. However, prior automated techniques mostly treat sign types as categorical and do not explicitly model their highly varied internal configurations. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach for recovering the fine-grained internal configuration of cuneiform signs by leveraging powerful generative models and the appearance and structure of prototype font images as priors. Our approach, ProtoSnap, enforces structural consistency on matches found with deep image features to estimate the diverse configurations of cuneiform characters, snapping a skeleton-based template to photographed cuneiform signs. We provide a new benchmark of expert annotations and evaluate our method on this task. Our evaluation shows that our approach succeeds in aligning prototype skeletons to a wide variety of cuneiform signs. Moreover, we show that conditioning on structures produced by our method allows for generating synthetic data with correct structural configurations, significantly boosting the performance of cuneiform sign recognition beyond existing techniques, in particular over rare signs. Our code, data, and trained models are available at the project page: https://tau-vailab.github.io/ProtoSnap/

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong performance in objection tasks; however, their ability to learn domain-specific applications with limited training data remains a significant challenge. Transfer learning techniques address this issue by leveraging knowledge from pre-training on related datasets, enabling faster and more efficient learning for new tasks. Finding the right dataset for pre-training can play a critical role in determining the success of transfer learning and overall model performance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of pre-training a YOLOv8n model on seven distinct datasets, evaluating their effectiveness when transferred to the task of polyp detection. We compare whether large, general-purpose datasets with diverse objects outperform niche datasets with characteristics similar to polyps. In addition, we assess the influence of the size of the dataset on the efficacy of transfer learning. Experiments on the polyp datasets show that models pre-trained on relevant datasets consistently outperform those trained from scratch, highlighting the benefit of pre-training on datasets with shared domain-specific features.

However, MRI-detected lesions must still be mapped to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images during biopsy, which results in missing CsPCa. This study systematically evaluates a multimodal AI framework integrating MRI and TRUS image sequences to enhance CsPCa identification. The study included 3110 patients from three cohorts across two institutions who underwent prostate biopsy. The proposed framework, based on the 3D UNet architecture, was evaluated on 1700 test cases, comparing performance to unimodal AI models that use either MRI or TRUS alone. Additionally, the proposed model was compared to radiologists in a cohort of 110 patients. The multimodal AI approach achieved superior sensitivity (80%) and Lesion Dice (42%) compared to unimodal MRI (73%, 30%) and TRUS models (49%, 27%). Compared to radiologists, the multimodal model showed higher specificity (88% vs. 78%) and Lesion Dice (38% vs. 33%), with equivalent sensitivity (79%). Our findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal AI to improve CsPCa lesion targeting during biopsy and treatment planning, surpassing current unimodal models and radiologists; ultimately improving outcomes for prostate cancer patients.

- **Summary**: Bias in machine learning models can lead to unfair decision making, and while it has been well-studied in the image and text domains, it remains underexplored in action recognition. Action recognition models often suffer from background bias (i.e., inferring actions based on background cues) and foreground bias (i.e., relying on subject appearance), which can be detrimental to real-life applications such as autonomous vehicles or assisted living monitoring. While prior approaches have mainly focused on mitigating background bias using specialized augmentations, we thoroughly study both biases. We propose ALBAR, a novel adversarial training method that mitigates foreground and background biases without requiring specialized knowledge of the bias attributes. Our framework applies an adversarial cross-entropy loss to the sampled static clip (where all the frames are the same) and aims to make its class probabilities uniform using a proposed entropy maximization loss. Additionally, we introduce a gradient penalty loss for regularization against the debiasing process. We evaluate our method on established background and foreground bias protocols, setting a new state-of-the-art and strongly improving combined debiasing performance by over 12% on HMDB51. Furthermore, we identify an issue of background leakage in the existing UCF101 protocol for bias evaluation which provides a shortcut to predict actions and does not provide an accurate measure of the debiasing capability of a model. We address this issue by proposing more fine-grained segmentation boundaries for the actor, where our method also outperforms existing approaches.

- **Summary**: MRI quality control (QC) is challenging due to unbalanced and limited datasets, as well as subjective scoring, which hinder the development of reliable automated QC systems. To address these issues, we introduce an approach that pretrains a model on synthetically generated motion artifacts before applying transfer learning for QC classification. This method not only improves the accuracy in identifying poor-quality scans but also reduces training time and resource requirements compared to training from scratch. By leveraging synthetic data, we provide a more robust and resource-efficient solution for QC automation in MRI, paving the way for broader adoption in diverse research settings.

- **Summary**: We introduce Lifting By Gaussians (LBG), a novel approach for open-world instance segmentation of 3D Gaussian Splatted Radiance Fields (3DGS). Recently, 3DGS Fields have emerged as a highly efficient and explicit alternative to Neural Field-based methods for high-quality Novel View Synthesis. Our 3D instance segmentation method directly lifts 2D segmentation masks from SAM (alternately FastSAM, etc.), together with features from CLIP and DINOv2, directly fusing them onto 3DGS (or similar Gaussian radiance fields such as 2DGS). Unlike previous approaches, LBG requires no per-scene training, allowing it to operate seamlessly on any existing 3DGS reconstruction. Our approach is not only an order of magnitude faster and simpler than existing approaches; it is also highly modular, enabling 3D semantic segmentation of existing 3DGS fields without requiring a specific parametrization of the 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, our technique achieves superior semantic segmentation for 2D semantic novel view synthesis and 3D asset extraction results while maintaining flexibility and efficiency. We further introduce a novel approach to evaluate individually segmented 3D assets from 3D radiance field segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: Human-in-the-loop optimization (HILO) is a promising approach for personalizing visual prostheses by iteratively refining stimulus parameters based on user feedback. Previous work demonstrated HILO's efficacy in simulation, but its performance with human participants remains untested. Here we evaluate HILO using sighted participants viewing simulated prosthetic vision to assess its ability to optimize stimulation strategies under realistic conditions. Participants selected between phosphenes generated by competing encoders to iteratively refine a deep stimulus encoder (DSE). We tested HILO in three conditions: standard optimization, threshold misspecifications, and out-of-distribution parameter sampling. Participants consistently preferred HILO-generated stimuli over both a na\"ive encoder and the DSE alone, with log odds favoring HILO across all conditions. We also observed key differences between human and simulated decision-making, highlighting the importance of validating optimization strategies with human participants. These findings support HILO as a viable approach for adapting visual prostheses to individuals.

- **Summary**: A major barrier to developing vision large language models (LLMs) in dermatology is the lack of large image--text pairs dataset. We introduce DermaSynth, a dataset comprising of 92,020 synthetic image--text pairs curated from 45,205 images (13,568 clinical and 35,561 dermatoscopic) for dermatology-related clinical tasks. Leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs, using Gemini 2.0, we used clinically related prompts and self-instruct method to generate diverse and rich synthetic texts. Metadata of the datasets were incorporated into the input prompts by targeting to reduce potential hallucinations. The resulting dataset builds upon open access dermatological image repositories (DERM12345, BCN20000, PAD-UFES-20, SCIN, and HIBA) that have permissive CC-BY-4.0 licenses. We also fine-tuned a preliminary Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct model, DermatoLlama 1.0, on 5,000 samples. We anticipate this dataset to support and accelerate AI research in dermatology.

- **Summary**: Sustainable agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring world food security for consumers. A critical challenge faced by sustainable precision agriculture is weed growth, as weeds share essential resources with the crops, such as water, soil nutrients, and sunlight, which notably affect crop yields. The traditional methods employed to combat weeds include the usage of chemical herbicides and manual weed removal methods. However, these could damage the environment and pose health hazards. The adoption of automated computer vision technologies and ground agricultural consumer electronic vehicles in precision agriculture offers sustainable, low-carbon solutions. However, prior works suffer from issues such as low accuracy and precision and high computational expense. This work proposes EcoWeedNet, a novel model with enhanced weed detection performance without adding significant computational complexity, aligning with the goals of low-carbon agricultural practices. Additionally, our model is lightweight and optimal for deployment on ground-based consumer electronic agricultural vehicles and robots. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the CottonWeedDet12 benchmark dataset reflecting real-world scenarios. EcoWeedNet achieves performance close to that of large models yet with much fewer parameters. (approximately 4.21% of the parameters and 6.59% of the GFLOPs of YOLOv4). This work contributes effectively to the development of automated weed detection methods for next-generation agricultural consumer electronics featuring lower energy consumption and lower carbon footprint. This work paves the way forward for sustainable agricultural consumer technologies.

- **Summary**: Balancing competing objectives remains a fundamental challenge in multi-task learning (MTL), primarily due to conflicting gradients across individual tasks. A common solution relies on computing a dynamic gradient update vector that balances competing tasks as optimization progresses. Building on this idea, we propose ConicGrad, a principled, scalable, and robust MTL approach formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces an angular constraint to dynamically regulate gradient update directions, confining them within a cone centered on the reference gradient of the overall objective. By balancing task-specific gradients without over-constraining their direction or magnitude, ConicGrad effectively resolves inter-task gradient conflicts. Moreover, our framework ensures computational efficiency and scalability to high-dimensional parameter spaces. We conduct extensive experiments on standard supervised learning and reinforcement learning MTL benchmarks, and demonstrate that ConicGrad achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks.
