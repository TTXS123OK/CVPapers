- **Summary**: In this work, we focus on scaling open-vocabulary action detection. Existing approaches for action detection are predominantly limited to closed-set scenarios and rely on complex, parameter-heavy architectures. Extending these models to the open-vocabulary setting poses two key challenges: (1) the lack of large-scale datasets with many action classes for robust training, and (2) parameter-heavy adaptations to a pretrained vision-language contrastive model to convert it for detection, risking overfitting the additional non-pretrained parameters to base action classes. Firstly, we introduce an encoder-only multimodal model for video action detection, reducing the reliance on parameter-heavy additions for video action detection. Secondly, we introduce a simple weakly supervised training strategy to exploit an existing closed-set action detection dataset for pretraining. Finally, we depart from the ill-posed base-to-novel benchmark used by prior works in open-vocabulary action detection and devise a new benchmark to evaluate on existing closed-set action detection datasets without ever using them for training, showing novel results to serve as baselines for future work.

- **Summary**: Background:Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Vision Transformers(ViT) are the main techniques used in Medical image segmentation. However, CNN is limited to local contextual information, and ViT's quadratic complexity results in significant computational costs. At the same time, equipping the model to distinguish lesion boundaries with varying degrees of severity is also a challenge encountered in skin lesion segmentation. Purpose:This research aims to optimize the balance between computational costs and long-range dependency modelling and achieve excellent generalization across lesions with different degrees of severity. Methods:we propose a lightweight U-shape network that utilizes Vision Fastformer with Fusion Mechanism (VFFM-UNet). We inherit the advantages of Fastformer's additive attention mechanism, combining element-wise product and matrix product for comprehensive feature extraction and channel reduction to save computational costs. In order to accurately identify the lesion boundaries with varying degrees of severity, we designed Fusion Mechanism including Multi-Granularity Fusion and Channel Fusion, which can process the feature maps in the granularity and channel levels to obtain different contextual information. Results:Comprehensive experiments on the ISIC2017, ISIC2018 and PH2 datasets demonstrate that VFFM-UNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art models regarding parameter numbers, computational complexity and segmentation performance. In short, compared to MISSFormer, our model achieves superior segmentation performance while reducing parameter and computation costs by 101x and 15x, respectively. Conclusions:Both quantitative and qualitative analyses show that VFFM-UNet sets a new benchmark by reaching an ideal balance between parameter numbers, computational complexity, and segmentation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in computer vision tasks but lack flexibility for edge devices' diverse needs. A vital issue is that ViTs pre-trained to cover a broad range of tasks are \textit{over-qualified} for edge devices that usually demand only part of a ViT's knowledge for specific tasks. Their task-specific accuracy on these edge devices is suboptimal. We discovered that small ViTs that focus on device-specific tasks can improve model accuracy and in the meantime, accelerate model inference. This paper presents NuWa, an approach that derives small ViTs from the base ViT for edge devices with specific task requirements. NuWa can transfer task-specific knowledge extracted from the base ViT into small ViTs that fully leverage constrained resources on edge devices to maximize model accuracy with inference latency assurance. Experiments with three base ViTs on three public datasets demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art solutions, NuWa improves model accuracy by up to $\text{11.83}\%$ and accelerates model inference by 1.29$\times$ - 2.79$\times$.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of AI-generated content brings significant concerns on the forensic and security issues such as source tracing, copyright protection, etc, highlighting the need for effective watermarking technologies. Font-based text watermarking has emerged as an effective solution to embed information, which could ensure copyright, traceability, and compliance of the generated text content. Existing font watermarking methods usually neglect essential font knowledge, which leads to watermarked fonts of low quality and limited embedding capacity. These methods are also vulnerable to real-world distortions, low-resolution fonts, and inaccurate character segmentation. In this paper, we introduce FontGuard, a novel font watermarking model that harnesses the capabilities of font models and language-guided contrastive learning. Unlike previous methods that focus solely on the pixel-level alteration, FontGuard modifies fonts by altering hidden style features, resulting in better font quality upon watermark embedding. We also leverage the font manifold to increase the embedding capacity of our proposed method by generating substantial font variants closely resembling the original font. Furthermore, in the decoder, we employ an image-text contrastive learning to reconstruct the embedded bits, which can achieve desirable robustness against various real-world transmission distortions. FontGuard outperforms state-of-the-art methods by +5.4%, +7.4%, and +5.8% in decoding accuracy under synthetic, cross-media, and online social network distortions, respectively, while improving the visual quality by 52.7% in terms of LPIPS. Moreover, FontGuard uniquely allows the generation of watermarked fonts for unseen fonts without re-training the network. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/KAHIMWONG/FontGuard.

- **Summary**: Robots operating in unstructured environments often require accurate and consistent object-level representations. This typically requires segmenting individual objects from the robot's surroundings. While recent large models such as Segment Anything (SAM) offer strong performance in 2D image segmentation. These advances do not translate directly to performance in the physical 3D world, where they often over-segment objects and fail to produce consistent mask correspondences across views. In this paper, we present GraphSeg, a framework for generating consistent 3D object segmentations from a sparse set of 2D images of the environment without any depth information. GraphSeg adds edges to graphs and constructs dual correspondence graphs: one from 2D pixel-level similarities and one from inferred 3D structure. We formulate segmentation as a problem of edge addition, then subsequent graph contraction, which merges multiple 2D masks into unified object-level segmentations. We can then leverage \emph{3D foundation models} to produce segmented 3D representations. GraphSeg achieves robust segmentation with significantly fewer images and greater accuracy than prior methods. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on tabletop scenes and show that GraphSeg enables improved performance on downstream robotic manipulation tasks.

- **Summary**: Accurate cloud property retrieval is vital for understanding cloud behavior and its impact on climate, including applications in weather forecasting, climate modeling, and estimating Earth's radiation balance. The Independent Pixel Approximation (IPA), a widely used physics-based approach, simplifies radiative transfer calculations by assuming each pixel is independent of its neighbors. While computationally efficient, IPA has significant limitations, such as inaccuracies from 3D radiative effects, errors at cloud edges, and ineffectiveness for overlapping or heterogeneous cloud fields. Recent AI/ML-based deep learning models have improved retrieval accuracy by leveraging spatial relationships across pixels. However, these models are often memory-intensive, retrieve only a single cloud property, or struggle with joint property retrievals. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CloudUNet with Attention Module (CAM), a compact UNet-based model that employs attention mechanisms to reduce errors in thick, overlapping cloud regions and a specialized loss function for joint retrieval of Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) and Cloud Effective Radius (CER). Experiments on a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) dataset show that our CAM model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods, reducing mean absolute errors (MAE) by 34% for COT and 42% for CER, and achieving 76% and 86% lower MAE for COT and CER retrievals compared to the IPA method.

- **Summary**: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) answers clinical questions using medical images, aiding diagnosis. Designing the MedVQA system holds profound importance in assisting clinical diagnosis and enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Building upon this foundation, Hierarchical Medical VQA extends Medical VQA by organizing medical questions into a hierarchical structure and making level-specific predictions to handle fine-grained distinctions. Recently, many studies have proposed hierarchical MedVQA tasks and established datasets, However, several issues still remain: (1) imperfect hierarchical modeling leads to poor differentiation between question levels causing semantic fragmentation across hierarchies. (2) Excessive reliance on implicit learning in Transformer-based cross-modal self-attention fusion methods, which obscures crucial local semantic correlations in medical scenarios. To address these issues, this study proposes a HiCA-VQA method, including two modules: Hierarchical Prompting for fine-grained medical questions and Hierarchical Answer Decoders. The hierarchical prompting module pre-aligns hierarchical text prompts with image features to guide the model in focusing on specific image regions according to question types, while the hierarchical decoder performs separate predictions for questions at different levels to improve accuracy across granularities. The framework also incorporates a cross-attention fusion module where images serve as queries and text as key-value pairs. Experiments on the Rad-Restruct benchmark demonstrate that the HiCA-VQA framework better outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in answering hierarchical fine-grained questions. This study provides an effective pathway for hierarchical visual question answering systems, advancing medical image understanding.

- **Summary**: Denoising is a crucial step in many video processing pipelines such as in interactive editing, where high quality, speed, and user control are essential. While recent approaches achieve significant improvements in denoising quality by leveraging deep learning, they are prone to unexpected failures due to discrepancies between training data distributions and the wide variety of noise patterns found in real-world videos. These methods also tend to be slow and lack user control. In contrast, traditional denoising methods perform reliably on in-the-wild videos and run relatively quickly on modern hardware. However, they require manually tuning parameters for each input video, which is not only tedious but also requires skill. We bridge the gap between these two paradigms by proposing a differentiable denoising pipeline based on traditional methods. A neural network is then trained to predict the optimal denoising parameters for each specific input, resulting in a robust and efficient approach that also supports user control.



### Model Reveals What to Cache: Profiling-Based Feature Reuse for Video Diffusion Models

- **Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.

- **Summary**: This study explores the application of supervised and unsupervised autoencoders (AEs) to automate nuclei classification in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) images, a diagnostic task traditionally reliant on subjective visual grading by pathologists. We evaluate various AE architectures, including standard AEs, contractive AEs (CAEs), and discriminative AEs (DAEs), as well as a classifier-based discriminative AE (CDAE), optimized using the hyperparameter tuning tool Optuna. Bhattacharyya distance is selected from several metrics to assess class separability in the latent space, revealing challenges in distinguishing adjacent grades using unsupervised models. CDAE, integrating a supervised classifier branch, demonstrated superior performance in both latent space separation and classification accuracy. Given that CDAE-CNN achieved notable improvements in classification metrics, affirming the value of supervised learning for class-specific feature extraction, F1 score was incorporated into the tuning process to optimize classification performance. Results show significant improvements in identifying aggressive ccRCC grades by leveraging the classification capability of AE through latent clustering followed by fine-grained classification. Our model outperforms the current state of the art, CHR-Network, across all evaluated metrics. These findings suggest that integrating a classifier branch in AEs, combined with neural architecture search and contrastive learning, enhances grading automation in ccRCC pathology, particularly in detecting aggressive tumor grades, and may improve diagnostic accuracy.

- **Summary**: Conventional Vision-Language Models(VLMs) typically utilize a fixed number of vision tokens, regardless of task complexity. This one-size-fits-all strategy introduces notable inefficiencies: using excessive tokens leads to unnecessary computational overhead in simpler tasks, whereas insufficient tokens compromise fine-grained visual comprehension in more complex contexts. To overcome these limitations, we present TokenFLEX, an innovative and adaptable vision-language framework that encodes images into a variable number of tokens for efficient integration with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach is underpinned by two pivotal innovations. Firstly, we present a novel training paradigm that enhances performance across varying numbers of vision tokens by stochastically modulating token counts during training. Secondly, we design a lightweight vision token projector incorporating an adaptive pooling layer and SwiGLU, allowing for flexible downsampling of vision tokens and adaptive selection of features tailored to specific token counts. Comprehensive experiments reveal that TokenFLEX consistently outperforms its fixed-token counterparts, achieving notable performance gains across various token counts enhancements of 1.6%, 1.0%, and 0.4% with 64, 144, and 256 tokens, respectively averaged over eight vision-language benchmarks. These results underscore TokenFLEX's remarkable flexibility while maintaining high-performance vision-language understanding.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for autonomous driving tasks. However, their spatial understanding and reasoning-key capabilities for autonomous driving-still exhibit significant limitations. Notably, none of the existing benchmarks systematically evaluate VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities in driving scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose NuScenes-SpatialQA, the first large-scale ground-truth-based Question-Answer (QA) benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of VLMs in autonomous driving. Built upon the NuScenes dataset, the benchmark is constructed through an automated 3D scene graph generation pipeline and a QA generation pipeline. The benchmark systematically evaluates VLMs' performance in both spatial understanding and reasoning across multiple dimensions. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse VLMs, including both general and spatial-enhanced models, providing the first comprehensive evaluation of their spatial capabilities in autonomous driving. Surprisingly, the experimental results show that the spatial-enhanced VLM outperforms in qualitative QA but does not demonstrate competitiveness in quantitative QA. In general, VLMs still face considerable challenges in spatial understanding and reasoning.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of foundation models has revolutionized visual representation learning in a self-supervised manner. However, their application in remote sensing (RS) remains constrained by a fundamental gap: existing models predominantly handle single or limited modalities, overlooking the inherently multi-modal nature of RS observations. Optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and multi-spectral data offer complementary insights that significantly reduce the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in single-source analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce RingMoE, a unified multi-modal RS foundation model with 14.7 billion parameters, pre-trained on 400 million multi-modal RS images from nine satellites. RingMoE incorporates three key innovations: (1) A hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture comprising modal-specialized, collaborative, and shared experts, effectively modeling intra-modal knowledge while capturing cross-modal dependencies to mitigate conflicts between modal representations; (2) Physics-informed self-supervised learning, explicitly embedding sensor-specific radiometric characteristics into the pre-training objectives; (3) Dynamic expert pruning, enabling adaptive model compression from 14.7B to 1B parameters while maintaining performance, facilitating efficient deployment in Earth observation applications. Evaluated across 23 benchmarks spanning six key RS tasks (i.e., classification, detection, segmentation, tracking, change detection, and depth estimation), RingMoE outperforms existing foundation models and sets new SOTAs, demonstrating remarkable adaptability from single-modal to multi-modal scenarios. Beyond theoretical progress, it has been deployed and trialed in multiple sectors, including emergency response, land management, marine sciences, and urban planning.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address a novel image restoration problem relevant to machine learning dataset curation: the detection and removal of noisy mirrored padding artifacts. While data augmentation techniques like padding are necessary for standardizing image dimensions, they can introduce artifacts that degrade model evaluation when datasets are repurposed across domains. We propose a systematic algorithm to precisely delineate the reflection boundary through a minimum mean squared error approach with thresholding and remove reflective padding. Our method effectively identifies the transition between authentic content and its mirrored counterpart, even in the presence of compression or interpolation noise. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficacy on the SHEL5k dataset, showing significant performance improvements in zero-shot object detection tasks using OWLv2, with average precision increasing from 0.47 to 0.61 for hard hat detection and from 0.68 to 0.73 for person detection. By addressing annotation inconsistencies and distorted objects in padded regions, our approach enhances dataset integrity, enabling more reliable model evaluation across computer vision tasks.

- **Summary**: The rapid expansion of remote sensing image archives demands the development of strong and efficient techniques for content-based image retrieval (RS-CBIR). This paper presents REJEPA (Retrieval with Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), an innovative self-supervised framework designed for unimodal RS-CBIR. REJEPA utilises spatially distributed context token encoding to forecast abstract representations of target tokens, effectively capturing high-level semantic features and eliminating unnecessary pixel-level details. In contrast to generative methods that focus on pixel reconstruction or contrastive techniques that depend on negative pairs, REJEPA functions within feature space, achieving a reduction in computational complexity of 40-60% when compared to pixel-reconstruction baselines like Masked Autoencoders (MAE). To guarantee strong and varied representations, REJEPA incorporates Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularisation (VICReg), which prevents encoder collapse by promoting feature diversity and reducing redundancy. The method demonstrates an estimated enhancement in retrieval accuracy of 5.1% on BEN-14K (S1), 7.4% on BEN-14K (S2), 6.0% on FMoW-RGB, and 10.1% on FMoW-Sentinel compared to prominent SSL techniques, including CSMAE-SESD, Mask-VLM, SatMAE, ScaleMAE, and SatMAE++, on extensive RS benchmarks BEN-14K (multispectral and SAR data), FMoW-RGB and FMoW-Sentinel. Through effective generalisation across sensor modalities, REJEPA establishes itself as a sensor-agnostic benchmark for efficient, scalable, and precise RS-CBIR, addressing challenges like varying resolutions, high object density, and complex backgrounds with computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: The increasing adoption of electric scooters (e-scooters) in urban areas has coincided with a rise in traffic accidents and injuries, largely due to their small wheels, lack of suspension, and sensitivity to uneven surfaces. While deep learning-based object detection has been widely used to improve automobile safety, its application for e-scooter obstacle detection remains unexplored. This study introduces a novel ground obstacle detection system for e-scooters, integrating an RGB camera, and a depth camera to enhance real-time road hazard detection. Additionally, the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measures linear vertical acceleration to identify surface vibrations, guiding the selection of six obstacle categories: tree branches, manhole covers, potholes, pine cones, non-directional cracks, and truncated domes. All sensors, including the RGB camera, depth camera, and IMU, are integrated within the Intel RealSense Camera D435i. A deep learning model powered by YOLO detects road hazards and utilizes depth data to estimate obstacle proximity. Evaluated on the seven hours of naturalistic riding dataset, the system achieves a high mean average precision (mAP) of 0.827 and demonstrates excellent real-time performance. This approach provides an effective solution to enhance e-scooter safety through advanced computer vision and data fusion. The dataset is accessible at https://zenodo.org/records/14583718, and the project code is hosted on https://github.com/Zeyang-Zheng/Real-Time-Roadway-Obstacle-Detection-for-Electric-Scooters.

- **Summary**: We propose an end-to-end trainable, cross-category method for reconstructing multiple man-made articulated objects from a single RGBD image, focusing on part-level shape reconstruction and pose and kinematics estimation. We depart from previous works that rely on learning instance-level latent space, focusing on man-made articulated objects with predefined part counts. Instead, we propose a novel alternative approach that employs part-level representation, representing instances as combinations of detected parts. While our detect-then-group approach effectively handles instances with diverse part structures and various part counts, it faces issues of false positives, varying part sizes and scales, and an increasing model size due to end-to-end training. To address these challenges, we propose 1) test-time kinematics-aware part fusion to improve detection performance while suppressing false positives, 2) anisotropic scale normalization for part shape learning to accommodate various part sizes and scales, and 3) a balancing strategy for cross-refinement between feature space and output space to improve part detection while maintaining model size. Evaluation on both synthetic and real data demonstrates that our method successfully reconstructs variously structured multiple instances that previous works cannot handle, and outperforms prior works in shape reconstruction and kinematics estimation.

- **Summary**: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a self-supervised learning technique that involves masking portions of an image, such as pixels, patches, or latent representations, and training models to predict the missing information using the visible context. This approach has emerged as a cornerstone in self-supervised learning, unlocking new possibilities in visual understanding by leveraging unannotated data for pre-training. In remote sensing, MIM addresses challenges such as incomplete data caused by cloud cover, occlusions, and sensor limitations, enabling applications like cloud removal, multi-modal data fusion, and super-resolution. By synthesizing and critically analyzing recent advancements, this survey (MIMRS) is a pioneering effort to chart the landscape of mask image modeling in remote sensing. We highlight state-of-the-art methodologies, applications, and future research directions, providing a foundational review to guide innovation in this rapidly evolving field.

- **Summary**: The JPEG standard was vastly successful. Currently, the first AI-based compression method ``JPEG AI'' will be standardized. JPEG AI brings remarkable benefits. JPEG AI images exhibit impressive image quality at bitrates that are an order of magnitude lower than images compressed with traditional JPEG. However, forensic analysis of JPEG AI has to be completely re-thought: forensic tools for traditional JPEG do not transfer to JPEG AI, and artifacts from JPEG AI are easily confused with artifacts from artificially generated images (``DeepFakes''). This creates a need for novel forensic approaches to detection and distinction of JPEG AI images. In this work, we make a first step towards a forensic JPEG AI toolset. We propose three cues for forensic algorithms for JPEG AI. These algorithms address three forensic questions: first, we show that the JPEG AI preprocessing introduces correlations in the color channels that do not occur in uncompressed images. Second, we show that repeated compression of JPEG AI images leads to diminishing distortion differences. This can be used to detect recompression, in a spirit similar to some classic JPEG forensics methods. Third, we show that the quantization of JPEG AI images in the latent space can be used to distinguish real images with JPEG AI compression from synthetically generated images. The proposed methods are interpretable for a forensic analyst, and we hope that they inspire further research in the forensics of AI-compressed images.

- **Summary**: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained traction in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) due to their strong generalization capabilities. However, existing DGSS methods often rely exclusively on either VFMs or VLMs, overlooking their complementary strengths. VFMs (e.g., DINOv2) excel at capturing fine-grained features, while VLMs (e.g., CLIP) provide robust text alignment but struggle with coarse granularity. Despite their complementary strengths, effectively integrating VFMs and VLMs with attention mechanisms is challenging, as the increased patch tokens complicate long-sequence modeling. To address this, we propose MFuser, a novel Mamba-based fusion framework that efficiently combines the strengths of VFMs and VLMs while maintaining linear scalability in sequence length. MFuser consists of two key components: MVFuser, which acts as a co-adapter to jointly fine-tune the two models by capturing both sequential and spatial dynamics; and MTEnhancer, a hybrid attention-Mamba module that refines text embeddings by incorporating image priors. Our approach achieves precise feature locality and strong text alignment without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFuser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS methods, achieving 68.20 mIoU on synthetic-to-real and 71.87 mIoU on real-to-real benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D scenes from monocular surgical videos can enhance surgeon's perception and therefore plays a vital role in various computer-assisted surgery tasks. However, achieving scale-consistent reconstruction remains an open challenge due to inherent issues in endoscopic videos, such as dynamic deformations and textureless surfaces. Despite recent advances, current methods either rely on calibration or instrument priors to estimate scale, or employ SfM-like multi-stage pipelines, leading to error accumulation and requiring offline optimization. In this paper, we present Endo3R, a unified 3D foundation model for online scale-consistent reconstruction from monocular surgical video, without any priors or extra optimization. Our model unifies the tasks by predicting globally aligned pointmaps, scale-consistent video depths, and camera parameters without any offline optimization. The core contribution of our method is expanding the capability of the recent pairwise reconstruction model to long-term incremental dynamic reconstruction by an uncertainty-aware dual memory mechanism. The mechanism maintains history tokens of both short-term dynamics and long-term spatial consistency. Notably, to tackle the highly dynamic nature of surgical scenes, we measure the uncertainty of tokens via Sampson distance and filter out tokens with high uncertainty. Regarding the scarcity of endoscopic datasets with ground-truth depth and camera poses, we further devise a self-supervised mechanism with a novel dynamics-aware flow loss. Abundant experiments on SCARED and Hamlyn datasets demonstrate our superior performance in zero-shot surgical video depth prediction and camera pose estimation with online efficiency.

- **Summary**: Hand gesture recognition using multichannel surface electromyography (sEMG) is challenging due to unstable predictions and inefficient time-varying feature enhancement. To overcome the lack of signal based time-varying feature problems, we propose a lightweight squeeze-excitation deep learning-based multi stream spatial temporal dynamics time-varying feature extraction approach to build an effective sEMG-based hand gesture recognition system. Each branch of the proposed model was designed to extract hierarchical features, capturing both global and detailed spatial-temporal relationships to ensure feature effectiveness. The first branch, utilizing a Bidirectional-TCN (Bi-TCN), focuses on capturing long-term temporal dependencies by modelling past and future temporal contexts, providing a holistic view of gesture dynamics. The second branch, incorporating a 1D Convolutional layer, separable CNN, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, efficiently extracts spatial-temporal features while emphasizing critical feature channels, enhancing feature relevance. The third branch, combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), captures bidirectional temporal relationships and time-varying patterns. Outputs from all branches are fused using concatenation to capture subtle variations in the data and then refined with a channel attention module, selectively focusing on the most informative features while improving computational efficiency. The proposed model was tested on the Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB5 datasets, achieving accuracy rates of 96.41%, 92.40%, and 93.34%, respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of the system to handle complex sEMG dynamics, offering advancements in prosthetic limb control and human-machine interface technologies with significant implications for assistive technologies.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to progressive cognitive decline, making early detection crucial for effective intervention. While deep learning models have shown high accuracy in AD diagnosis, their lack of interpretability limits clinical trust and adoption. This paper introduces a novel pre-model approach leveraging Jacobian Maps (JMs) within a multi-modal framework to enhance explainability and trustworthiness in AD detection. By capturing localized brain volume changes, JMs establish meaningful correlations between model predictions and well-known neuroanatomical biomarkers of AD. We validate JMs through experiments comparing a 3D CNN trained on JMs versus on traditional preprocessed data, which demonstrates superior accuracy. We also employ 3D Grad-CAM analysis to provide both visual and quantitative insights, further showcasing improved interpretability and diagnostic reliability.

- **Summary**: Traffic crash detection in long-form surveillance videos is critical for emergency response and infrastructure planning but remains difficult due to the brief and rare nature of crash events. We introduce HybridMamba, a novel architecture that combines visual transformers with state-space temporal modeling to achieve accurate crash time localization. Our method uses multi-level token compression and hierarchical temporal processing to remain computationally efficient without sacrificing temporal resolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset from the Iowa Department of Transportation, HybridMamba achieves a mean absolute error of 1.50 seconds, with 65.2 percent of predictions within one second of the ground truth. It outperforms recent video-language models such as TimeChat and VideoLLaMA2 by up to 2.8 seconds, while using significantly fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate strong generalization across videos ranging from 2 to 40 minutes in diverse conditions. HybridMamba offers a robust and efficient solution for fine-grained temporal localization in traffic surveillance. The code will be released upon publication.

- **Summary**: Malware detection is increasingly challenged by evolving techniques like obfuscation and polymorphism, limiting the effectiveness of traditional methods. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of software containers has introduced new security challenges, including the growing threat of malicious software injection, where a container, once compromised, can serve as entry point for further cyberattacks. In this work, we address these security issues by introducing a method to identify compromised containers through machine learning analysis of their file systems. We cast the entire software containers into large RGB images via their tarball representations, and propose to use established Convolutional Neural Network architectures on a streaming, patch-based manner. To support our experiments, we release the COSOCO dataset--the first of its kind--containing 3364 large-scale RGB images of benign and compromised software containers at https://huggingface.co/datasets/k3ylabs/cosoco-image-dataset. Our method detects more malware and achieves higher F1 and Recall scores than all individual and ensembles of VirusTotal engines, demonstrating its effectiveness and setting a new standard for identifying malware-compromised software containers.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, a lot of old floor plans exist in printed form or are stored as scanned raster images. Slight rotations or shifts may occur during scanning. Bringing floor plans of this form into a machine readable form to enable further use, still poses a problem. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that pre-processes the image and leverages a novel approach to create a region adjacency graph (RAG) from the pre-processed image and predict its nodes. By incorporating normalization steps into the RAG feature extraction, we significantly improved the rotation invariance of the RAG feature calculation. Moreover, applying our method leads to an improved F1 score and IoU on rotated data. Furthermore, we proposed a wall splitting algorithm for partitioning walls into segments associated with the corresponding rooms.

- **Summary**: The localization of moving robots depends on the availability of good features from the environment. Sensor systems like Lidar are popular, but unique features can also be extracted from images of the ground. This work presents the Keypoint Localization Framework (KOALA), which utilizes deep neural networks that extract sufficient features from an industrial floor for accurate localization without having readable markers. For this purpose, we use a floor covering that can be produced as cheaply as common industrial floors. Although we do not use any filtering, prior, or temporal information, we can estimate our position in 75.7 % of all images with a mean position error of 2 cm and a rotation error of 2.4 %. Thus, the robot kidnapping problem can be solved with high precision in every frame, even while the robot is moving. Furthermore, we show that our framework with our detector and descriptor combination is able to outperform comparable approaches.

- **Summary**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a crucial remote sensing technology, enabling all-weather, day-and-night observation with strong surface penetration for precise and continuous environmental monitoring and analysis. However, SAR image interpretation remains challenging due to its complex physical imaging mechanisms and significant visual disparities from human perception. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in RGB image understanding, offering powerful open-vocabulary interpretation and flexible language interaction. However, their application to SAR images is severely constrained by the absence of SAR-specific knowledge in their training distributions, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce SARLANG-1M, a large-scale benchmark tailored for multimodal SAR image understanding, with a primary focus on integrating SAR with textual modality. SARLANG-1M comprises more than 1 million high-quality SAR image-text pairs collected from over 59 cities worldwide. It features hierarchical resolutions (ranging from 0.1 to 25 meters), fine-grained semantic descriptions (including both concise and detailed captions), diverse remote sensing categories (1,696 object types and 16 land cover classes), and multi-task question-answering pairs spanning seven applications and 1,012 question types. Extensive experiments on mainstream VLMs demonstrate that fine-tuning with SARLANG-1M significantly enhances their performance in SAR image interpretation, reaching performance comparable to human experts. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Jimmyxichen/SARLANG-1M.

- **Summary**: Query denoising has become a standard training strategy for DETR-based detectors by addressing the slow convergence issue. Besides that, query denoising can be used to increase the diversity of training samples for modeling complex scenarios which is critical for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT), showing its potential in MOT application. Existing approaches integrate query denoising within the tracking-by-attention paradigm. However, as the denoising process only happens within the single frame, it cannot benefit the tracker to learn temporal-related information. In addition, the attention mask in query denoising prevents information exchange between denoising and object queries, limiting its potential in improving association using self-attention. To address these issues, we propose TQD-Track, which introduces Temporal Query Denoising (TQD) tailored for MOT, enabling denoising queries to carry temporal information and instance-specific feature representation. We introduce diverse noise types onto denoising queries that simulate real-world challenges in MOT. We analyze our proposed TQD for different tracking paradigms, and find out the paradigm with explicit learned data association module, e.g. tracking-by-detection or alternating detection and association, benefit from TQD by a larger margin. For these paradigms, we further design an association mask in the association module to ensure the consistent interaction between track and detection queries as during inference. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances different tracking methods by only changing the training process, especially the paradigms with explicit association module.

- **Summary**: Generating multiple new concepts remains a challenging problem in the text-to-image task. Current methods often overfit when trained on a small number of samples and struggle with attribute leakage, particularly for class-similar subjects (e.g., two specific dogs). In this paper, we introduce Fuse-and-Refine (FaR), a novel approach that tackles these challenges through two key contributions: Concept Fusion technique and Localized Refinement loss function. Concept Fusion systematically augments the training data by separating reference subjects from backgrounds and recombining them into composite images to increase diversity. This augmentation technique tackles the overfitting problem by mitigating the narrow distribution of the limited training samples. In addition, Localized Refinement loss function is introduced to preserve subject representative attributes by aligning each concept's attention map to its correct region. This approach effectively prevents attribute leakage by ensuring that the diffusion model distinguishes similar subjects without mixing their attention maps during the denoising process. By fine-tuning specific modules at the same time, FaR balances the learning of new concepts with the retention of previously learned knowledge. Empirical results show that FaR not only prevents overfitting and attribute leakage while maintaining photorealism, but also outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: With more well-performing anomaly detection methods proposed, many of the single-view tasks have been solved to a relatively good degree. However, real-world production scenarios often involve complex industrial products, whose properties may not be fully captured by one single image. While normalizing flow based approaches already work well in single-camera scenarios, they currently do not make use of the priors in multi-view data. We aim to bridge this gap by using these flow-based models as a strong foundation and propose Multi-Flow, a novel multi-view anomaly detection method. Multi-Flow makes use of a novel multi-view architecture, whose exact likelihood estimation is enhanced by fusing information across different views. For this, we propose a new cross-view message-passing scheme, letting information flow between neighboring views. We empirically validate it on the real-world multi-view data set Real-IAD and reach a new state-of-the-art, surpassing current baselines in both image-wise and sample-wise anomaly detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Generative modeling of anatomical structures plays a crucial role in virtual imaging trials, which allow researchers to perform studies without the costs and constraints inherent to in vivo and phantom studies. For clinical relevance, generative models should allow targeted control to simulate specific patient populations rather than relying on purely random sampling. In this work, we propose a steerable generative model based on implicit neural representations. Implicit neural representations naturally support topology changes, making them well-suited for anatomical structures with varying topology, such as the thyroid. Our model learns a disentangled latent representation, enabling fine-grained control over shape variations. Evaluation includes reconstruction accuracy and anatomical plausibility. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high-quality shape generation while enabling targeted anatomical modifications.

- **Summary**: Existing debiasing approaches in Visual Question Answering (VQA) primarily focus on enhancing visual learning, integrating auxiliary models, or employing data augmentation strategies. However, these methods exhibit two major drawbacks. First, current debiasing techniques fail to capture the superior relation between images and texts because prevalent learning frameworks do not enable models to extract deeper correlations from highly contrasting samples. Second, they do not assess the relevance between the input question and image during inference, as no prior work has examined the degree of input relevance in debiasing studies. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a novel framework, Optimized Question-Image Relation Learning (QIRL), which employs a generation-based self-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, two modules are introduced to address the aforementioned issues. The Negative Image Generation (NIG) module automatically produces highly irrelevant question-image pairs during training to enhance correlation learning, while the Irrelevant Sample Identification (ISI) module improves model robustness by detecting and filtering irrelevant inputs, thereby reducing prediction errors. Furthermore, to validate our concept of reducing output errors through filtering unrelated question-image inputs, we propose a specialized metric to evaluate the performance of the ISI module. Notably, our approach is model-agnostic and can be integrated with various VQA models. Extensive experiments on VQA-CPv2 and VQA-v2 demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method. Among data augmentation strategies, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often exhibit overconfidence when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, posing significant challenges for deployment. Since DNNs are trained on in-distribution (ID) datasets, the information flow of ID samples through DNNs inevitably differs from that of OOD samples. In this paper, we propose an Entropy-based Out-Of-distribution Detection (EOOD) framework. EOOD first identifies specific block where the information flow differences between ID and OOD samples are more pronounced, using both ID and pseudo-OOD samples. It then calculates the conditional entropy on the selected block as the OOD confidence score. Comprehensive experiments conducted across various ID and OOD settings demonstrate the effectiveness of EOOD in OOD detection and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text recognition led to a paradigm shift for page-level recognition, from multi-step segmentation-based approaches to end-to-end attention-based ones. However, the na\"ive character-level autoregressive decoding process results in long prediction times: it requires several seconds to process a single page image on a modern GPU. We propose the Meta Document Attention Network (Meta-DAN) as a novel decoding strategy to reduce the prediction time while enabling a better context modeling. It relies on two main components: windowed queries, to process several transformer queries altogether, enlarging the context modeling with near future; and multi-token predictions, whose goal is to predict several tokens per query instead of only the next one. We evaluate the proposed approach on 10 full-page handwritten datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on average in terms of character error rate. Source code and weights of trained models are available at https://github.com/FactoDeepLearning/meta_dan.

- **Summary**: Grasping is a fundamental skill for interacting with and manipulating objects in the environment. However, this ability can be challenging for individuals with hand impairments. Soft hand exoskeletons designed to assist grasping can enhance or restore essential hand functions, yet controlling these soft exoskeletons to support users effectively remains difficult due to the complexity of understanding the environment. This study presents a vision-based predictive control framework that leverages contextual awareness from depth perception to predict the grasping target and determine the next control state for activation. Unlike data-driven approaches that require extensive labelled datasets and struggle with generalizability, our method is grounded in geometric modelling, enabling robust adaptation across diverse grasping scenarios. The Grasping Ability Score (GAS) was used to evaluate performance, with our system achieving a state-of-the-art GAS of 91% across 15 objects and healthy participants, demonstrating its effectiveness across different object types. The proposed approach maintained reconstruction success for unseen objects, underscoring its enhanced generalizability compared to learning-based models.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel method for brain segmentation using only FLAIR MRIs, specifically targeting cases where access to other imaging modalities is limited. By leveraging existing automatic segmentation methods, we train a network to approximate segmentations, typically obtained from T1-weighted MRIs. Our method, called FLAIRBrainSeg, produces segmentations of 132 structures and is robust to multiple sclerosis lesions. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms modality-agnostic approaches based on image synthesis, the only currently available alternative for performing brain parcellation using FLAIR MRI alone. This technique holds promise for scenarios where T1-weighted MRIs are unavailable and offers a valuable alternative for clinicians and researchers in need of reliable anatomical segmentation.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a cutting-edge neural network-based technique for novel view synthesis in 3D reconstruction. However, its significant computational demands pose challenges for deployment on mobile devices. While mesh-based NeRF solutions have shown potential in achieving real-time rendering on mobile platforms, they often fail to deliver high-quality reconstructions when rendering practical complex scenes. Additionally, the non-negligible memory overhead caused by pre-computed intermediate results complicates their practical application. To overcome these challenges, we present NeRFlex, a resource-aware, high-resolution, real-time rendering framework for complex scenes on mobile devices. NeRFlex integrates mobile NeRF rendering with multi-NeRF representations that decompose a scene into multiple sub-scenes, each represented by an individual NeRF network. Crucially, NeRFlex considers both memory and computation constraints as first-class citizens and redesigns the reconstruction process accordingly. NeRFlex first designs a detail-oriented segmentation module to identify sub-scenes with high-frequency details. For each NeRF network, a lightweight profiler, built on domain knowledge, is used to accurately map configurations to visual quality and memory usage. Based on these insights and the resource constraints on mobile devices, NeRFlex presents a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently determine configurations for all NeRF representations, despite the NP-hardness of the original decision problem. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets and mobile devices demonstrate that NeRFlex achieves real-time, high-quality rendering on commercial mobile devices.

- **Summary**: Dealing with environments with sparse rewards has always been crucial for systems developed to operate in autonomous open-ended learning settings. Intrinsic Motivations could be an effective way to help Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms learn in such scenarios. In fact, intrinsic reward signals, such as novelty or curiosity, are generally adopted to improve exploration when extrinsic rewards are delayed or absent. Building on previous works, we tackle the problem of learning policies in the presence of sparse rewards by proposing a two-level architecture that alternates an ''intrinsically driven'' phase of exploration and autonomous sub-goal generation, to a phase of sparse reward, goal-directed policy learning. The idea is to build several small networks, each one specialized on a particular sub-path, and use them as starting points for future exploration without the need to further explore from scratch previously learnt paths. Two versions of the system have been trained and tested in the Gym SuperMarioBros environment without considering any additional extrinsic reward. The results show the validity of our approach and the importance of autonomously segment the environment to generate an efficient path towards the final goal.

- **Summary**: Reliable 3D object perception is essential in autonomous driving. Owing to its sensing capabilities in all weather conditions, 4D radar has recently received much attention. However, compared to LiDAR, 4D radar provides much sparser point cloud. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection method, termed ZFusion, which fuses 4D radar and vision modality. As the core of ZFusion, our proposed FP-DDCA (Feature Pyramid-Double Deformable Cross Attention) fuser complements the (sparse) radar information and (dense) vision information, effectively. Specifically, with a feature-pyramid structure, the FP-DDCA fuser packs Transformer blocks to interactively fuse multi-modal features at different scales, thus enhancing perception accuracy. In addition, we utilize the Depth-Context-Split view transformation module due to the physical properties of 4D radar. Considering that 4D radar has a much lower cost than LiDAR, ZFusion is an attractive alternative to LiDAR-based methods. In typical traffic scenarios like the VoD (View-of-Delft) dataset, experiments show that with reasonable inference speed, ZFusion achieved the state-of-the-art mAP (mean average precision) in the region of interest, while having competitive mAP in the entire area compared to the baseline methods, which demonstrates performance close to LiDAR and greatly outperforms those camera-only methods.

- **Summary**: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a serious and common complication of diabetes, caused by prolonged high blood sugar levels that damage the small retinal blood vessels. If left untreated, DR can progress to retinal vein occlusion and stimulate abnormal blood vessel growth, significantly increasing the risk of blindness. Traditional diabetes diagnosis methods often utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract visual features from retinal images, followed by classification algorithms such as decision trees and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for disease detection. However, these approaches face several challenges, including low accuracy and sensitivity, lengthy machine learning (ML) model training due to high data complexity and volume, and the use of limited datasets for testing and evaluation. This study investigates the application of transfer learning (TL) to enhance ML model performance in DR detection. Key improvements include dimensionality reduction, optimized learning rate adjustments, and advanced parameter tuning algorithms, aimed at increasing efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. The proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 84% on the testing dataset, outperforming prior studies. The highest class-specific accuracy reached 89%, with a maximum sensitivity of 97% and an F1-score of 92%, demonstrating strong performance in identifying DR cases. These findings suggest that TL-based DR screening is a promising approach for early diagnosis, enabling timely interventions to prevent vision loss and improve patient outcomes.

- **Summary**: To leverage the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) it is crucial to have some information on their answers' uncertainty. This means that the model has to be able to quantify how certain it is in the correctness of a given response. Bad uncertainty estimates can lead to overconfident wrong answers undermining trust in these models. Quite a lot of research has been done on language models that work with text inputs and provide text outputs. Still, since the visual capabilities have been added to these models recently, there has not been much progress on the uncertainty of Visual Language Models (VLMs). We tested three state-of-the-art VLMs on corrupted image data. We found that the severity of the corruption negatively impacted the models' ability to estimate their uncertainty and the models also showed overconfidence in most of the experiments.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based methods have improved anomaly detection and localization, but challenges persist in precisely localizing small anomalies. While CNNs face limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, transformer architectures often suffer from substantial computational overheads. We introduce a state space model (SSM)-based Pyramidal Scanning Strategy (PSS) for multi-class anomaly detection and localization--a novel approach designed to address the challenge of small anomaly localization. Our method captures fine-grained details at multiple scales by integrating the PSS with a pre-trained encoder for multi-scale feature extraction and a feature-level synthetic anomaly generator. An improvement of $+1\%$ AP for multi-class anomaly localization and a +$1\%$ increase in AU-PRO on MVTec benchmark demonstrate our method's superiority in precise anomaly localization across diverse industrial scenarios.

- **Summary**: Adjusting and deforming 3D garments to body shapes, body motion, and cloth material is an important problem in virtual and augmented reality. Applications are numerous, ranging from virtual change rooms to the entertainment and gaming industry. This problem is challenging as garment dynamics influence geometric details such as wrinkling patterns, which depend on physical input including the wearer's body shape and motion, as well as cloth material features. Existing work studies learning-based modeling techniques to generate garment deformations from example data, and physics-inspired simulators to generate realistic garment dynamics. We propose here a learning-based approach trained on data generated with a physics-based simulator. Compared to prior work, our 3D generative model learns garment deformations for loose cloth geometry, especially for large deformations and dynamic wrinkles driven by body motion and cloth material. Furthermore, the model can be efficiently fitted to observations captured using vision sensors. We propose to leverage the capability of diffusion models to learn fine-scale detail: we model the 3D garment in a 2D parameter space, and learn a latent diffusion model using this representation independent from the mesh resolution. This allows to condition global and local geometric information with body and material information. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our method on both simulated data and data captured with a multi-view acquisition platform. Compared to strong baselines, our method is more accurate in terms of Chamfer distance.

- **Summary**: Traditional diffusion models typically employ a U-Net architecture. Previous studies have unveiled the roles of attention blocks in the U-Net. However, they overlook the dynamic evolution of their importance during the inference process, which hinders their further exploitation to improve image applications. In this study, we first theoretically proved that, re-weighting the outputs of the Transformer blocks within the U-Net is a "free lunch" for improving the signal-to-noise ratio during the sampling process. Next, we proposed Importance Probe to uncover and quantify the dynamic shifts in importance of the Transformer blocks throughout the denoising process. Finally, we design an adaptive importance-based re-weighting schedule tailored to specific image generation and editing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the inference process, and enhances the aesthetic quality of the samples with identity consistency. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into any U-Net-based architecture. Code: https://github.com/Hytidel/UNetReweighting

- **Summary**: This study addresses the essential task of medical image segmentation, which involves the automatic identification and delineation of anatomical structures and pathological regions in medical images. Accurate segmentation is crucial in radiology, as it aids in the precise localization of abnormalities such as tumors, thereby enabling effective diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of disease progression. Specifically, the size, shape, and location of tumors can significantly influence clinical decision-making and therapeutic strategies, making accurate segmentation a key component of radiological workflows. However, challenges posed by variations in MRI modalities, image artifacts, and the scarcity of labeled data complicate the segmentation task and impact the performance of traditional models. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised learning Multi-encoder nnU-Net architecture designed to process multiple MRI modalities independently through separate encoders. This approach allows the model to capture modality-specific features before fusing them for the final segmentation, thus improving accuracy. Our Multi-encoder nnU-Net demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 93.72%, which surpasses that of other models such as vanilla nnU-Net, SegResNet, and Swin UNETR. By leveraging the unique information provided by each modality, the model enhances segmentation tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited annotated data. Evaluations highlight the effectiveness of this architecture in improving tumor segmentation outcomes.

- **Summary**: Accurate lumbar spine segmentation is crucial for diagnosing spinal disorders. Existing methods typically use coarse-grained segmentation strategies that lack the fine detail needed for precise diagnosis. Additionally, their reliance on visual-only models hinders the capture of anatomical semantics, leading to misclassified categories and poor segmentation details. To address these limitations, we present ATM-Net, an innovative framework that employs an anatomy-aware, text-guided, multi-modal fusion mechanism for fine-grained segmentation of lumbar substructures, i.e., vertebrae (VBs), intervertebral discs (IDs), and spinal canal (SC). ATM-Net adopts the Anatomy-aware Text Prompt Generator (ATPG) to adaptively convert image annotations into anatomy-aware prompts in different views. These insights are further integrated with image features via the Holistic Anatomy-aware Semantic Fusion (HASF) module, building a comprehensive anatomical context. The Channel-wise Contrastive Anatomy-Aware Enhancement (CCAE) module further enhances class discrimination and refines segmentation through class-wise channel-level multi-modal contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on the MRSpineSeg and SPIDER datasets demonstrate that ATM-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with consistent improvements regarding class discrimination and segmentation details. For example, ATM-Net achieves Dice of 79.39% and HD95 of 9.91 pixels on SPIDER, outperforming the competitive SpineParseNet by 8.31% and 4.14 pixels, respectively.

- **Summary**: Label noise poses a significant challenge in Earth Observation (EO), often degrading the performance and reliability of supervised Machine Learning (ML) models. Yet, given the critical nature of several EO applications, developing robust and trustworthy ML solutions is essential. In this study, we take a step in this direction by leveraging probabilistic ML to model input-dependent label noise and quantify data uncertainty in EO tasks, accounting for the unique noise sources inherent in the domain. We train uncertainty-aware probabilistic models across a broad range of high-impact EO applications-spanning diverse noise sources, input modalities, and ML configurations-and introduce a dedicated pipeline to assess their accuracy and reliability. Our experimental results show that the uncertainty-aware models consistently outperform the standard deterministic approaches across most datasets and evaluation metrics. Moreover, through rigorous uncertainty evaluation, we validate the reliability of the predicted uncertainty estimates, enhancing the interpretability of model predictions. Our findings emphasize the importance of modeling label noise and incorporating uncertainty quantification in EO, paving the way for more accurate, reliable, and trustworthy ML solutions in the field.

- **Summary**: Super-resolution (SR) techniques are critical for enhancing image quality, particularly in scenarios where high-resolution imagery is essential yet limited by hardware constraints. Existing diffusion models for SR have relied predominantly on Gaussian models for noise generation, which often fall short when dealing with the complex and variable texture inherent in natural scenes. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Bayesian Uncertainty Guided Diffusion Probabilistic Model (BUFF). BUFF distinguishes itself by incorporating a Bayesian network to generate high-resolution uncertainty masks. These masks guide the diffusion process, allowing for the adjustment of noise intensity in a manner that is both context-aware and adaptive. This novel approach not only enhances the fidelity of super-resolved images to their original high-resolution counterparts but also significantly mitigates artifacts and blurring in areas characterized by complex textures and fine details. The model demonstrates exceptional robustness against complex noise patterns and showcases superior adaptability in handling textures and edges within images. Empirical evidence, supported by visual results, illustrates the model's robustness, especially in challenging scenarios, and its effectiveness in addressing common SR issues such as blurring. Experimental evaluations conducted on the DIV2K dataset reveal that BUFF achieves a notable improvement, with a +0.61 increase compared to baseline in SSIM on BSD100, surpassing traditional diffusion approaches by an average additional +0.20dB PSNR gain. These findings underscore the potential of Bayesian methods in enhancing diffusion processes for SR, paving the way for future advancements in the field.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce long-video masked-embedding autoencoders (LV-MAE), a self-supervised learning framework for long video representation. Our approach treats short- and long-span dependencies as two separate tasks. Such decoupling allows for a more intuitive video processing where short-span spatiotemporal primitives are first encoded and are then used to capture long-range dependencies across consecutive video segments. To achieve this, we leverage advanced off-the-shelf multimodal encoders to extract representations from short segments within the long video, followed by pre-training a masked-embedding autoencoder capturing high-level interactions across segments. LV-MAE is highly efficient to train and enables the processing of much longer videos by alleviating the constraint on the number of input frames. Furthermore, unlike existing methods that typically pre-train on short-video datasets, our approach offers self-supervised pre-training using long video samples (e.g., 20+ minutes video clips) at scale. Using LV-MAE representations, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three long-video benchmarks -- LVU, COIN, and Breakfast -- employing only a simple classification head for either attentive or linear probing. Finally, to assess LV-MAE pre-training and visualize its reconstruction quality, we leverage the video-language aligned space of short video representations to monitor LV-MAE through video-text retrieval.

- **Summary**: Cropland non-agriculturalization refers to the conversion of arable land into non-agricultural uses such as forests, residential areas, and construction sites. This phenomenon not only directly leads to the loss of cropland resources but also poses systemic threats to food security and agricultural sustainability. Accurate identification of cropland and non-cropland areas is crucial for detecting and addressing this issue. Traditional CNNs employ static convolution layers, while dynamic convolution studies demonstrate that adaptively weighting multiple convolutional kernels through attention mechanisms can enhance accuracy. However, existing dynamic convolution methods relying on Global Average Pooling (GAP) for attention weight allocation suffer from information loss, limiting segmentation precision. This paper proposes Frequency-Aware Dynamic Convolution (FADConv) and a Frequency Attention (FAT) module to address these limitations. Building upon the foundational structure of dynamic convolution, we designed FADConv by integrating 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (2D DCT) to capture frequency domain features and fuse them. FAT module generates high-quality attention weights that replace the traditional GAP method,making the combination between dynamic convolution kernels more reasonable.Experiments on the GID and Hi-CNA datasets demonstrate that FADConv significantly improves segmentation accuracy with minimal computational overhead. For instance, ResNet18 with FADConv achieves 1.9% and 2.7% increases in F1-score and IoU for cropland segmentation on GID, with only 58.87M additional MAdds. Compared to other dynamic convolution approaches, FADConv exhibits superior performance in cropland segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Methods for navigation based on large-scale learning typically treat each episode as a new problem, where the agent is spawned with a clean memory in an unknown environment. While these generalization capabilities to an unknown environment are extremely important, we claim that, in a realistic setting, an agent should have the capacity of exploiting information collected during earlier robot operations. We address this by introducing a new retrieval-augmented agent, trained with RL, capable of querying a database collected from previous episodes in the same environment and learning how to integrate this additional context information. We introduce a unique agent architecture for the general navigation task, evaluated on ObjectNav, ImageNav and Instance-ImageNav. Our retrieval and context encoding methods are data-driven and heavily employ vision foundation models (FM) for both semantic and geometric understanding. We propose new benchmarks for these settings and we show that retrieval allows zero-shot transfer across tasks and environments while significantly improving performance.

- **Summary**: Single-image human reconstruction is vital for digital human modeling applications but remains an extremely challenging task. Current approaches rely on generative models to synthesize multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction and animation. However, directly generating multiple views from a single human image suffers from geometric inconsistencies, resulting in issues like fragmented or blurred limbs in the reconstructed models. To tackle these limitations, we introduce \textbf{HumanDreamer-X}, a novel framework that integrates multi-view human generation and reconstruction into a unified pipeline, which significantly enhances the geometric consistency and visual fidelity of the reconstructed 3D models. In this framework, 3D Gaussian Splatting serves as an explicit 3D representation to provide initial geometry and appearance priority. Building upon this foundation, \textbf{HumanFixer} is trained to restore 3DGS renderings, which guarantee photorealistic results. Furthermore, we delve into the inherent challenges associated with attention mechanisms in multi-view human generation, and propose an attention modulation strategy that effectively enhances geometric details identity consistency across multi-view. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach markedly improves generation and reconstruction PSNR quality metrics by 16.45% and 12.65%, respectively, achieving a PSNR of up to 25.62 dB, while also showing generalization capabilities on in-the-wild data and applicability to various human reconstruction backbone models.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved considerable performance across various agentic planning tasks. However, traditional agent planning approaches adopt a "flood irrigation" methodology that indiscriminately injects gold trajectories, external feedback, and domain knowledge into agent models. This practice overlooks the fundamental human cognitive principle of situational self-awareness during decision-making-the ability to dynamically assess situational demands and strategically employ resources during decision-making. We propose agentic knowledgeable self-awareness to address this gap, a novel paradigm enabling LLM-based agents to autonomously regulate knowledge utilization. Specifically, we propose KnowSelf, a data-centric approach that applies agents with knowledgeable self-awareness like humans. Concretely, we devise a heuristic situation judgement criterion to mark special tokens on the agent's self-explored trajectories for collecting training data. Through a two-stage training process, the agent model can switch between different situations by generating specific special tokens, achieving optimal planning effects with minimal costs. Our experiments demonstrate that KnowSelf can outperform various strong baselines on different tasks and models with minimal use of external knowledge.

- **Summary**: In the interaction between agents and their environments, agents expand their capabilities by planning and executing actions. However, LLM-based agents face substantial challenges when deployed in novel environments or required to navigate unconventional action spaces. To empower agents to autonomously explore environments, optimize workflows, and enhance their understanding of actions, we propose SynWorld, a framework that allows agents to synthesize possible scenarios with multi-step action invocation within the action space and perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to effectively refine their action knowledge in the current environment. Our experiments demonstrate that SynWorld is an effective and general approach to learning action knowledge in new environments. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/SynWorld.

  Foundation Models for Autonomous Driving (WDFM-AD)
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: 3D object detection is crucial for autonomous driving, leveraging both LiDAR point clouds for precise depth information and camera images for rich semantic information. Therefore, the multi-modal methods that combine both modalities offer more robust detection results. However, efficiently fusing LiDAR points and images remains challenging due to the domain gaps. In addition, the performance of many models is limited by the amount of high quality labeled data, which is expensive to create. The recent advances in foundation models, which use large-scale pre-training on different modalities, enable better multi-modal fusion. Combining the prompt engineering techniques for efficient training, we propose the Prompted Foundational 3D Detector (PF3Det), which integrates foundation model encoders and soft prompts to enhance LiDAR-camera feature fusion. PF3Det achieves the state-of-the-art results under limited training data, improving NDS by 1.19% and mAP by 2.42% on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrating its efficiency in 3D detection.

- **Summary**: Self-Supervised Video Hashing (SSVH) compresses videos into hash codes for efficient indexing and retrieval using unlabeled training videos. Existing approaches rely on random frame sampling to learn video features and treat all frames equally. This results in suboptimal hash codes, as it ignores frame-specific information density and reconstruction difficulty. To address this limitation, we propose a new framework, termed AutoSSVH, that employs adversarial frame sampling with hash-based contrastive learning. Our adversarial sampling strategy automatically identifies and selects challenging frames with richer information for reconstruction, enhancing encoding capability. Additionally, we introduce a hash component voting strategy and a point-to-set (P2Set) hash-based contrastive objective, which help capture complex inter-video semantic relationships in the Hamming space and improve the discriminability of learned hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoSSVH achieves superior retrieval efficacy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Pretrain techniques, whether supervised or self-supervised, are widely used in deep learning to enhance model performance. In real-world clinical scenarios, different sets of magnetic resonance (MR) contrasts are often acquired for different subjects/cases, creating challenges for deep learning models assuming consistent input modalities among all the cases and between pretrain and finetune. Existing methods struggle to maintain performance when there is an input modality/contrast set mismatch with the pretrained model, often resulting in degraded accuracy. We propose an adaptive Vision Transformer (AdaViT) framework capable of handling variable set of input modalities for each case. We utilize a dynamic tokenizer to encode different input image modalities to tokens and take advantage of the characteristics of the transformer to build attention mechanism across variable length of tokens. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this architecture effectively transfers supervised pretrained models to new datasets with different input modality/contrast sets, resulting in superior performance on zero-shot testing, few-shot finetuning, and backward transferring in brain infarct and brain tumor segmentation tasks. Additionally, for self-supervised pretrain, the proposed method is able to maximize the pretrain data and facilitate transferring to diverse downstream tasks with variable sets of input modalities.

- **Summary**: Medical image and video segmentation is a critical task for precision medicine, which has witnessed considerable progress in developing task or modality-specific and generalist models for 2D images. However, there have been limited studies on building general-purpose models for 3D images and videos with comprehensive user studies. Here, we present MedSAM2, a promptable segmentation foundation model for 3D image and video segmentation. The model is developed by fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model 2 on a large medical dataset with over 455,000 3D image-mask pairs and 76,000 frames, outperforming previous models across a wide range of organs, lesions, and imaging modalities. Furthermore, we implement a human-in-the-loop pipeline to facilitate the creation of large-scale datasets resulting in, to the best of our knowledge, the most extensive user study to date, involving the annotation of 5,000 CT lesions, 3,984 liver MRI lesions, and 251,550 echocardiogram video frames, demonstrating that MedSAM2 can reduce manual costs by more than 85%. MedSAM2 is also integrated into widely used platforms with user-friendly interfaces for local and cloud deployment, making it a practical tool for supporting efficient, scalable, and high-quality segmentation in both research and healthcare environments.

- **Summary**: Registering human meshes to 3D point clouds is essential for applications such as augmented reality and human-robot interaction but often yields imprecise results due to noise and background clutter in real-world data. We introduce a hybrid approach that incorporates body-part segmentation into the mesh fitting process, enhancing both human pose estimation and segmentation accuracy. Our method first assigns body part labels to individual points, which then guide a two-step SMPL-X fitting: initial pose and orientation estimation using body part centroids, followed by global refinement of the point cloud alignment. Additionally, we demonstrate that the fitted human mesh can refine body part labels, leading to improved segmentation. Evaluations on the cluttered and noisy real-world datasets InterCap, EgoBody, and BEHAVE show that our approach significantly outperforms prior methods in both pose estimation and segmentation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has achieved some success in addressing the challenge of cloud removal in optical satellite images, by fusing with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for cloud removal, delivering higher-quality estimation by sampling from cloud-free distributions, compared to earlier methods. However, diffusion models initiate sampling from pure Gaussian noise, which complicates the sampling trajectory and results in suboptimal performance. Also, current methods fall short in effectively fusing SAR and optical data. To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion Bridges for Cloud Removal, DB-CR, which directly bridges between the cloudy and cloud-free image distributions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal diffusion bridge architecture with a two-branch backbone for multimodal image restoration, incorporating an efficient backbone and dedicated cross-modality fusion blocks to effectively extract and fuse features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images. By formulating cloud removal as a diffusion-bridge problem and leveraging this tailored architecture, DB-CR achieves high-fidelity results while being computationally efficient. We evaluated DB-CR on the SEN12MS-CR cloud-removal dataset, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Rapid advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, which, while beneficial in many domains, also pose serious risks in terms of disinformation, fraud, and other malicious applications. Current synthetic image identification systems are typically static, relying on feature representations learned from known generators; as new generative models emerge, these systems suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce the concept of an autonomous self-adaptive synthetic media identification system -- one that not only detects synthetic images and attributes them to known sources but also autonomously identifies and incorporates novel generators without human intervention. Our approach leverages an open-set identification strategy with an evolvable embedding space that distinguishes between known and unknown sources. By employing an unsupervised clustering method to aggregate unknown samples into high-confidence clusters and continuously refining its decision boundaries, our system maintains robust detection and attribution performance even as the generative landscape evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, marking a crucial step toward universal, adaptable forensic systems in the era of rapidly advancing generative models.

- **Summary**: We introduce \textbf{VISTA-OCR} (Vision and Spatially-aware Text Analysis OCR), a lightweight architecture that unifies text detection and recognition within a single generative model. Unlike conventional methods that require separate branches with dedicated parameters for text recognition and detection, our approach leverages a Transformer decoder to sequentially generate text transcriptions and their spatial coordinates in a unified branch. Built on an encoder-decoder architecture, VISTA-OCR is progressively trained, starting with the visual feature extraction phase, followed by multitask learning with multimodal token generation. To address the increasing demand for versatile OCR systems capable of advanced tasks, such as content-based text localization \ref{content_based_localization}, we introduce new prompt-controllable OCR tasks during pre-training.To enhance the model's capabilities, we built a new dataset composed of real-world examples enriched with bounding box annotations and synthetic samples. Although recent Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) can efficiently perform these tasks, their high computational cost remains a barrier for practical deployment. In contrast, our VISTA$_{\text{omni}}$ variant processes both handwritten and printed documents with only 150M parameters, interactively, by prompting. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that VISTA-OCR achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models on standard OCR tasks while showing strong potential for more sophisticated OCR applications, addressing the growing need for interactive OCR systems. All code and annotations for VISTA-OCR will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: The quality of synthetically generated images (e.g. those produced by diffusion models) are often evaluated using information about image contents encoded by pretrained auxiliary models. For example, the Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID) uses embeddings from an InceptionV3 model pretrained to classify ImageNet. The effectiveness of this feature embedding model has considerable impact on the trustworthiness of the calculated metric (affecting its suitability in several domains, including medical imaging). Here, uncertainty quantification (UQ) is used to provide a heuristic measure of the trustworthiness of the feature embedding model and an FID-like metric called the Fr\'{e}chet Autoencoder Distance (FAED). We apply Monte Carlo dropout to a feature embedding model (convolutional autoencoder) to model the uncertainty in its embeddings. The distribution of embeddings for each input are then used to compute a distribution of FAED values. We express uncertainty as the predictive variance of the embeddings as well as the standard deviation of the computed FAED values. We find that their magnitude correlates with the extent to which the inputs are out-of-distribution to the model's training data, providing some validation of its ability to assess the trustworthiness of the FAED.

- **Summary**: The concept of viewing graph solvability has gained significant interest in the context of structure-from-motion. A viewing graph is a mathematical structure where nodes are associated to cameras and edges represent the epipolar geometry connecting overlapping views. Solvability studies under which conditions the cameras are uniquely determined by the graph. In this paper we propose a novel framework for analyzing solvability problems based on Algebraic Geometry, demonstrating its potential in understanding structure-from-motion graphs and proving a conjecture that was previously proposed.

- **Summary**: We explore how body shapes influence human motion synthesis, an aspect often overlooked in existing text-to-motion generation methods due to the ease of learning a homogenized, canonical body shape. However, this homogenization can distort the natural correlations between different body shapes and their motion dynamics. Our method addresses this gap by generating body-shape-aware human motions from natural language prompts. We utilize a finite scalar quantization-based variational autoencoder (FSQ-VAE) to quantize motion into discrete tokens and then leverage continuous body shape information to de-quantize these tokens back into continuous, detailed motion. Additionally, we harness the capabilities of a pretrained language model to predict both continuous shape parameters and motion tokens, facilitating the synthesis of text-aligned motions and decoding them into shape-aware motions. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively, and also conduct a comprehensive perceptual study to demonstrate its efficacy in generating shape-aware motions.

- **Summary**: To develop general-purpose collaborative agents, humans need reliable AI systems that can (1) adapt to new domains and (2) transparently reason with uncertainty to allow for verification and correction. Black-box models demonstrate powerful data processing abilities but do not satisfy these criteria due to their opaqueness, domain specificity, and lack of uncertainty awareness. We introduce Bonsai, a compositional and probabilistic reasoning system that generates adaptable inference trees by retrieving relevant grounding evidence and using it to compute likelihoods of sub-claims derived from broader natural language inferences. Bonsai's reasoning power is tunable at test-time via evidence scaling and it demonstrates reliable handling of varied domains including transcripts, photographs, videos, audio, and databases. Question-answering and human alignment experiments demonstrate that Bonsai matches the performance of domain-specific black-box methods while generating interpretable, grounded, and uncertainty-aware reasoning traces.

- **Summary**: Existing MLLM benchmarks face significant challenges in evaluating Unified MLLMs (U-MLLMs) due to: 1) lack of standardized benchmarks for traditional tasks, leading to inconsistent comparisons; 2) absence of benchmarks for mixed-modality generation, which fails to assess multimodal reasoning capabilities. We present a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to systematically assess U-MLLMs. Our benchmark includes: Standardized Traditional Task Evaluation. We sample from 12 datasets, covering 10 tasks with 30 subtasks, ensuring consistent and fair comparisons across studies." 2. Unified Task Assessment. We introduce five novel tasks testing multimodal reasoning, including image editing, commonsense QA with image generation, and geometric reasoning. 3. Comprehensive Model Benchmarking. We evaluate 12 leading U-MLLMs, such as Janus-Pro, EMU3, VILA-U, and Gemini2-flash, alongside specialized understanding (e.g., Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and generation models (e.g., DALL-E-3). Our findings reveal substantial performance gaps in existing U-MLLMs, highlighting the need for more robust models capable of handling mixed-modality tasks effectively. The code and evaluation data can be found in https://mme-unify.github.io/.
