- **Summary**: Road environment segmentation plays a significant role in autonomous driving. Numerous works based on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and Transformer architectures have been proposed to leverage local and global contextual learning for efficient and accurate semantic segmentation. In both architectures, the encoder often relies heavily on extracting continuous representations from the image, which limits the ability to represent meaningful discrete information. To address this limitation, we propose segmentation of the autonomous driving environment using vector quantization. Vector quantization offers three primary advantages for road environment segmentation. (1) Each continuous feature from the encoder is mapped to a discrete vector from the codebook, helping the model discover distinct features more easily than with complex continuous features. (2) Since a discrete feature acts as compressed versions of the encoder's continuous features, they also compress noise or outliers, enhancing the image segmentation task. (3) Vector quantization encourages the latent space to form coarse clusters of continuous features, forcing the model to group similar features, making the learned representations more structured for the decoding process. In this work, we combined vector quantization with the lightweight image segmentation model MobileUNETR and used it as a baseline model for comparison to demonstrate its efficiency. Through experiments, we achieved 77.0 % mIoU on Cityscapes, outperforming the baseline by 2.9 % without increasing the model's initial size or complexity.

- **Summary**: Large models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence, powering applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, fully fine-tuning these models remains expensive, requiring extensive computational resources, memory, and task-specific data. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a promising solution that allows adapting large models to downstream tasks by updating only a small portion of parameters. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of PEFT techniques, focusing on their motivations, design principles, and effectiveness. We begin by analyzing the resource and accessibility challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning and highlight key issues, such as overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and parameter inefficiency. We then introduce a structured taxonomy of PEFT methods -- grouped into additive, selective, reparameterized, hybrid, and unified frameworks -- and systematically compare their mechanisms and trade-offs. Beyond taxonomy, we explore the impact of PEFT across diverse domains, including language, vision, and generative modeling, showing how these techniques offer strong performance with lower resource costs. We also discuss important open challenges in scalability, interpretability, and robustness, and suggest future directions such as federated learning, domain adaptation, and theoretical grounding. Our goal is to provide a unified understanding of PEFT and its growing role in enabling practical, efficient, and sustainable use of large models.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning is a popular fine-tuning method for vision-language models due to its efficiency. It requires a small number of additional learnable parameters while significantly enhancing performance on target tasks. However, most existing methods suffer from overfitting to fine-tuning data, yielding poor generalizability. To address this, we propose a new training objective function based on a Bayesian learning principle to balance adaptability and generalizability. We derive a prior over the logits, where the mean function is parameterized by the pre-trained model, while the posterior corresponds to the fine-tuned model. This objective establishes a balance by allowing the fine-tuned model to adapt to downstream tasks while remaining close to the pre-trained model.

- **Summary**: The challenge of tracing the source attribution of forged faces has gained significant attention due to the rapid advancement of generative models. However, existing deepfake attribution (DFA) works primarily focus on the interaction among various domains in vision modality, and other modalities such as texts and face parsing are not fully explored. Besides, they tend to fail to assess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen generators in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-modal guided multi-perspective representation learning (BMRL) framework for zero-shot deepfake attribution (ZS-DFA), which facilitates effective traceability to unseen generators. Specifically, we design a multi-perspective visual encoder (MPVE) to explore general deepfake attribution visual characteristics across three views (i.e., image, noise, and edge). We devise a novel parsing encoder to focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA representation learning via vision-parsing matching. A language encoder is proposed to capture fine-grained language embeddings, facilitating language-guided general visual forgery representation learning through vision-language alignment. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake attribution contrastive center (DFACC) loss, to pull relevant generators closer and push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to enhance traceability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the ZS-DFA task through various protocols evaluation.

- **Summary**: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. We compare the U-Net with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error of between 9% and 13% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.53% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated remarkable success in 3D point cloud analysis, particularly through masked autoencoders (MAEs). However, existing MAE-based methods lack rotation invariance, leading to significant performance degradation when processing arbitrarily rotated point clouds in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce Handcrafted Feature-Based Rotation-Invariant Masked Autoencoder (HFBRI-MAE), a novel framework that refines the MAE design with rotation-invariant handcrafted features to ensure stable feature learning across different orientations. By leveraging both rotation-invariant local and global features for token embedding and position embedding, HFBRI-MAE effectively eliminates rotational dependencies while preserving rich geometric structures. Additionally, we redefine the reconstruction target to a canonically aligned version of the input, mitigating rotational ambiguities. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart demonstrate that HFBRI-MAE consistently outperforms existing methods in object classification, segmentation, and few-shot learning, highlighting its robustness and strong generalization ability in real-world 3D applications.

- **Summary**: High-fidelity simulation is essential for robotics research, enabling safe and efficient testing of perception, control, and navigation algorithms. However, achieving both photorealistic rendering and accurate physics modeling remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel simulation framework--the Unreal Robotics Lab (URL) that integrates the Unreal Engine's advanced rendering capabilities with MuJoCo's high-precision physics simulation. Our approach enables realistic robotic perception while maintaining accurate physical interactions, facilitating benchmarking and dataset generation for vision-based robotics applications. The system supports complex environmental effects, such as smoke, fire, and water dynamics, which are critical for evaluating robotic performance under adverse conditions. We benchmark visual navigation and SLAM methods within our framework, demonstrating its utility for testing real-world robustness in controlled yet diverse scenarios. By bridging the gap between physics accuracy and photorealistic rendering, our framework provides a powerful tool for advancing robotics research and sim-to-real transfer.

- **Summary**: Compared to single-target adversarial attacks, multi-target attacks have garnered significant attention due to their ability to generate adversarial images for multiple target classes simultaneously. Existing generative approaches for multi-target attacks mainly analyze the effect of the use of target labels on noise generation from a theoretical perspective, lacking practical validation and comprehensive summarization. To address this gap, we first identify and validate that the semantic feature quality and quantity are critical factors affecting the transferability of targeted attacks: 1) Feature quality refers to the structural and detailed completeness of the implanted target features, as deficiencies may result in the loss of key discriminative information; 2) Feature quantity refers to the spatial sufficiency of the implanted target features, as inadequacy limits the victim model's attention to this feature. Based on these findings, we propose the 2D Tensor-Guided Adversarial Fusion (2D-TGAF) framework, which leverages the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models to encode target labels into two-dimensional semantic tensors for guiding adversarial noise generation. Additionally, we design a novel masking strategy tailored for the training process, ensuring that parts of the generated noise retain complete semantic information about the target class. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that 2D-TGAF consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in attack success rates, both on normally trained models and across various defense mechanisms.

- **Summary**: Image-based crack detection algorithms are increasingly in demand in infrastructure monitoring, as early detection of cracks is of paramount importance for timely maintenance planning. While deep learning has significantly advanced crack detection algorithms, existing models often require extensive labeled datasets and high computational costs for fine-tuning, limiting their adaptability across diverse conditions. This study introduces an efficient selective fine-tuning strategy, focusing on tuning normalization components, to enhance the adaptability of segmentation models for crack detection. The proposed method is applied to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and five well-established segmentation models. Experimental results demonstrate that selective fine-tuning of only normalization parameters outperforms full fine-tuning and other common fine-tuning techniques in both performance and computational efficiency, while improving generalization. The proposed approach yields a SAM-based model, Segment Any Crack (SAC), achieving a 61.22\% F1-score and 44.13\% IoU on the OmniCrack30k benchmark dataset, along with the highest performance across three zero-shot datasets and the lowest standard deviation. The results highlight the effectiveness of the adaptation approach in improving segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead.

- **Summary**: Background: Automated classification of thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) images faces challenges in limited data, inter-observer variability, and computational cost. Efficient, interpretable models are crucial for clinical support. Objective: To develop and externally validate a deep learning system for the multi-class classification of thyroid FNAB images into three key categories that directly guide post-biopsy treatment decisions in Vietnam: benign (B2), suspicious for malignancy (B5), and malignant (B6), while achieving high diagnostic accuracy with low computational overhead. Methods: Our framework features: (1) YOLOv10-based cell cluster detection for informative sub-region extraction and noise reduction; (2) a curriculum learning-inspired protocol sequencing localized crops to full images for multi-scale feature capture; (3) adaptive lightweight EfficientNetB0 (4 millions parameters) selection balancing performance and efficiency; and (4) a Transformer-inspired module for multi-scale, multi-region analysis. External validation used 1,015 independent FNAB images. Results: ThyroidEffi Basic achieved a macro F1 of 89.19\% and AUCs of 0.98 (B2), 0.95 (B5), and 0.96 (B6) on the internal test set. External validation yielded AUCs of 0.9495 (B2), 0.7436 (B5), and 0.8396 (B6). ThyroidEffi Premium improved macro F1 to 89.77\%. Grad-CAM highlighted key diagnostic regions, confirming interpretability. The system processed 1000 cases in 30 seconds, demonstrating feasibility on widely accessible hardware like a 12-core CPU. Conclusions: This work demonstrates that high-accuracy, interpretable thyroid FNAB image classification is achievable with minimal computational demands.

- **Summary**: We present LOCATE 3D, a model for localizing objects in 3D scenes from referring expressions like "the small coffee table between the sofa and the lamp." LOCATE 3D sets a new state-of-the-art on standard referential grounding benchmarks and showcases robust generalization capabilities. Notably, LOCATE 3D operates directly on sensor observation streams (posed RGB-D frames), enabling real-world deployment on robots and AR devices. Key to our approach is 3D-JEPA, a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm applicable to sensor point clouds. It takes as input a 3D pointcloud featurized using 2D foundation models (CLIP, DINO). Subsequently, masked prediction in latent space is employed as a pretext task to aid the self-supervised learning of contextualized pointcloud features. Once trained, the 3D-JEPA encoder is finetuned alongside a language-conditioned decoder to jointly predict 3D masks and bounding boxes. Additionally, we introduce LOCATE 3D DATASET, a new dataset for 3D referential grounding, spanning multiple capture setups with over 130K annotations. This enables a systematic study of generalization capabilities as well as a stronger model.

- **Summary**: Cloud segmentation from intensity images is a pivotal task in atmospheric science and computer vision, aiding weather forecasting and climate analysis. Ground-based sky/cloud segmentation extracts clouds from images for further feature analysis. Existing methods struggle to balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, limiting real-world deployment on edge devices, so we introduce SCANet, a novel lightweight cloud segmentation model featuring Segregation and Context Aggregation Module (SCAM), which refines rough segmentation maps into weighted sky and cloud features processed separately. SCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing computational complexity. SCANet-large (4.29M) achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods with 70.9% fewer parameters. Meanwhile, SCANet-lite (90K) delivers 1390 fps in FP16, surpassing real-time standards. Additionally, we propose an efficient pre-training strategy that enhances performance even without ImageNet pre-training.

- **Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to adapt to new tasks without parameter updates, using a few demonstrations from a large support set. However, selecting informative demonstrations leads to high computational and memory costs. While some methods explore selecting a small and representative coreset in the text classification, evaluating all support set samples remains costly, and discarded samples lead to unnecessary information loss. These methods may also be less effective for image classification due to differences in feature spaces. Given these limitations, we propose Key-based Coreset Optimization (KeCO), a novel framework that leverages untapped data to construct a compact and informative coreset. We introduce visual features as keys within the coreset, which serve as the anchor for identifying samples to be updated through different selection strategies. By leveraging untapped samples from the support set, we update the keys of selected coreset samples, enabling the randomly initialized coreset to evolve into a more informative coreset under low computational cost. Through extensive experiments on coarse-grained and fine-grained image classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that KeCO effectively enhances ICL performance for image classification task, achieving an average improvement of more than 20\%. Notably, we evaluate KeCO under a simulated online scenario, and the strong performance in this scenario highlights the practical value of our framework for resource-constrained real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel framework for ID-preserving generation using a multi-modal encoding strategy rather than injecting identity features via adapters into pre-trained models. Our method treats identity and text as a unified conditioning input. To achieve this, we introduce FaceCLIP, a multi-modal encoder that learns a joint embedding space for both identity and textual semantics. Given a reference face and a text prompt, FaceCLIP produces a unified representation that encodes both identity and text, which conditions a base diffusion model to generate images that are identity-consistent and text-aligned. We also present a multi-modal alignment algorithm to train FaceCLIP, using a loss that aligns its joint representation with face, text, and image embedding spaces. We then build FaceCLIP-SDXL, an ID-preserving image synthesis pipeline by integrating FaceCLIP with Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). Compared to prior methods, FaceCLIP-SDXL enables photorealistic portrait generation with better identity preservation and textual relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate its quantitative and qualitative superiority.

- **Summary**: We present PRISM, a unified framework that enables multiple image generation and editing tasks in a single foundational model. Starting from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, PRISM proposes an effective fine-tuning strategy to produce RGB images along with intrinsic maps (referred to as X layers) simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, which infer intrinsic properties individually or require separate models for decomposition and conditional generation, PRISM maintains consistency across modalities by generating all intrinsic layers jointly. It supports diverse tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. Additionally, PRISM enables both global and local image editing through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of PRISM both for intrinsic image decomposition and conditional image generation while preserving the base model's text-to-image generation capability.

- **Summary**: The increasing complexity of industrial anomaly detection (IAD) has positioned multimodal detection methods as a focal area of machine vision research. However, dedicated multimodal datasets specifically tailored for IAD remain limited. Pioneering datasets like MVTec 3D have laid essential groundwork in multimodal IAD by incorporating RGB+3D data, but still face challenges in bridging the gap with real industrial environments due to limitations in scale and resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce Real-IAD D3, a high-precision multimodal dataset that uniquely incorporates an additional pseudo3D modality generated through photometric stereo, alongside high-resolution RGB images and micrometer-level 3D point clouds. Real-IAD D3 features finer defects, diverse anomalies, and greater scale across 20 categories, providing a challenging benchmark for multimodal IAD Additionally, we introduce an effective approach that integrates RGB, point cloud, and pseudo-3D depth information to leverage the complementary strengths of each modality, enhancing detection performance. Our experiments highlight the importance of these modalities in boosting detection robustness and overall IAD performance. The dataset and code are publicly accessible for research purposes at https://realiad4ad.github.io/Real-IAD D3

- **Summary**: Source-Free Unsupervised Open-Set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA) methods using CLIP face significant issues: (1) while heavily dependent on domain-specific threshold selection, existing methods employ simple fixed thresholds, underutilizing CLIP's zero-shot potential in SF-OSDA scenarios; and (2) overlook intrinsic class tendencies while employing complex training to enforce feature separation, incurring deployment costs and feature shifts that compromise CLIP's generalization ability. To address these issues, we propose CLIPXpert, a novel SF-OSDA approach that integrates two key components: an adaptive thresholding strategy and an unknown class feature filtering module. Specifically, the Box-Cox GMM-Based Adaptive Thresholding (BGAT) module dynamically determines the optimal threshold by estimating sample score distributions, balancing known class recognition and unknown class sample detection. Additionally, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-Based Unknown-Class Feature Filtering (SUFF) module reduces the tendency of unknown class samples towards known classes, improving the separation between known and unknown classes. Experiments show that our source-free and training-free method outperforms state-of-the-art trained approach UOTA by 1.92% on the DomainNet dataset, achieves SOTA-comparable performance on datasets such as Office-Home, and surpasses other SF-OSDA methods. This not only validates the effectiveness of our proposed method but also highlights CLIP's strong zero-shot potential for SF-OSDA tasks.

- **Summary**: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have become a de facto choice for many downstream vision tasks, like image classification, image segmentation, and object localization. However, they can also provide significant utility for downstream 3D tasks that can leverage the cross-modal information (e.g., from paired image data). In our work, we further explore the utility of VFMs for adapting from a labeled source to unlabeled target data for the task of LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation. Our method consumes paired 2D-3D (image and point cloud) data and relies on the robust (cross-domain) features from a VFM to train a 3D backbone on a mix of labeled source and unlabeled target data. At the heart of our method lies a fusion network that is guided by both the image and point cloud streams, with their relative contributions adjusted based on the target domain. We extensively compare our proposed methodology with different state-of-the-art methods in several settings and achieve strong performance gains. For example, achieving an average improvement of 6.5 mIoU (over all tasks), when compared with the previous state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Reflective documents often suffer from specular highlights under ambient lighting, severely hindering text readability and degrading overall visual quality. Although recent deep learning methods show promise in highlight removal, they remain suboptimal for document images, primarily due to the lack of dedicated datasets and tailored architectural designs. To tackle these challenges, we present DocHR14K, a large-scale real-world dataset comprising 14,902 high-resolution image pairs across six document categories and various lighting conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first high-resolution dataset for document highlight removal that captures a wide range of real-world lighting conditions. Additionally, motivated by the observation that the residual map between highlighted and clean images naturally reveals the spatial structure of highlight regions, we propose a simple yet effective Highlight Location Prior (HLP) to estimate highlight masks without human annotations. Building on this prior, we present the Location-Aware Laplacian Pyramid Highlight Removal Network (L2HRNet), which effectively removes highlights by leveraging estimated priors and incorporates diffusion module to restore details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DocHR14K improves highlight removal under diverse lighting conditions. Our L2HRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, including a 5.01\% increase in PSNR and a 13.17\% reduction in RMSE on DocHR14K.

- **Summary**: Point cloud data is pivotal in applications like autonomous driving, virtual reality, and robotics. However, its substantial volume poses significant challenges in storage and transmission. In order to obtain a high compression ratio, crucial semantic details usually confront severe damage, leading to difficulties in guaranteeing the accuracy of downstream tasks. To tackle this problem, we are the first to introduce a novel Region of Interest (ROI)-guided Point Cloud Geometry Compression (RPCGC) method for human and machine vision. Our framework employs a dual-branch parallel structure, where the base layer encodes and decodes a simplified version of the point cloud, and the enhancement layer refines this by focusing on geometry details. Furthermore, the residual information of the enhancement layer undergoes refinement through an ROI prediction network. This network generates mask information, which is then incorporated into the residuals, serving as a strong supervision signal. Additionally, we intricately apply these mask details in the Rate-Distortion (RD) optimization process, with each point weighted in the distortion calculation. Our loss function includes RD loss and detection loss to better guide point cloud encoding for the machine. Experiment results demonstrate that RPCGC achieves exceptional compression performance and better detection accuracy (10% gain) than some learning-based compression methods at high bitrates in ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets.

- **Summary**: Progress in image generation raises significant public security concerns. We argue that fake image detection should not operate as a "black box". Instead, an ideal approach must ensure both strong generalization and transparency. Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offers new opportunities for reasoning-based AI-generated image detection. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in comparison to traditional detection methods and human evaluators, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we design six distinct prompts and propose a framework that integrates these prompts to develop a more robust, explainable, and reasoning-driven detection system.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Restoring any degraded image efficiently via just one model has become increasingly significant and impactful, especially with the proliferation of mobile devices. Traditional solutions typically involve training dedicated models per degradation, resulting in inefficiency and redundancy. More recent approaches either introduce additional modules to learn visual prompts, significantly increasing model size, or incorporate cross-modal transfer from large language models trained on vast datasets, adding complexity to the system architecture. In contrast, our approach, termed AnyIR, takes a unified path that leverages inherent similarity across various degradations to enable both efficient and comprehensive restoration through a joint embedding mechanism, without scaling up the model or relying on large language models.Specifically, we examine the sub-latent space of each input, identifying key components and reweighting them first in a gated manner. To fuse the intrinsic degradation awareness and the contextualized attention, a spatial-frequency parallel fusion strategy is proposed for enhancing spatial-aware local-global interactions and enriching the restoration details from the frequency perspective. Extensive benchmarking in the all-in-one restoration setting confirms AnyIR's SOTA performance, reducing model complexity by around 82\% in parameters and 85\% in FLOPs. Our code will be available at our Project page (https://amazingren.github.io/AnyIR/)

- **Summary**: Vein recognition technologies have become one of the primary solutions for high-security identification systems. However, the issue of biometric information leakage can still pose a serious threat to user privacy and anonymity. Currently, there is no cancelable biometric template generation scheme specifically designed for vein biometrics. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative cancelable vein biometric generation scheme: ColorVein. Unlike previous cancelable template generation schemes, ColorVein does not destroy the original biometric features and introduces additional color information to grayscale vein images. This method significantly enhances the information density of vein images by transforming static grayscale information into dynamically controllable color representations through interactive colorization. ColorVein allows users/administrators to define a controllable pseudo-random color space for grayscale vein images by editing the position, number, and color of hint points, thereby generating protected cancelable templates. Additionally, we propose a new secure center loss to optimize the training process of the protected feature extraction model, effectively increasing the feature distance between enrolled users and any potential impostors. Finally, we evaluate ColorVein's performance on all types of vein biometrics, including recognition performance, unlinkability, irreversibility, and revocability, and conduct security and privacy analyses. ColorVein achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.



### Visual Consensus Prompting for Co-Salient Object Detection

- **Summary**: Existing co-salient object detection (CoSOD) methods generally employ a three-stage architecture (i.e., encoding, consensus extraction & dispersion, and prediction) along with a typical full fine-tuning paradigm. Although they yield certain benefits, they exhibit two notable limitations: 1) This architecture relies on encoded features to facilitate consensus extraction, but the meticulously extracted consensus does not provide timely guidance to the encoding stage. 2) This paradigm involves globally updating all parameters of the model, which is parameter-inefficient and hinders the effective representation of knowledge within the foundation model for this task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an interaction-effective and parameter-efficient concise architecture for the CoSOD task, addressing two key limitations. It introduces, for the first time, a parameter-efficient prompt tuning paradigm and seamlessly embeds consensus into the prompts to formulate task-specific Visual Consensus Prompts (VCP). Our VCP aims to induce the frozen foundation model to perform better on CoSOD tasks by formulating task-specific visual consensus prompts with minimized tunable parameters. Concretely, the primary insight of the purposeful Consensus Prompt Generator (CPG) is to enforce limited tunable parameters to focus on co-salient representations and generate consensus prompts. The formulated Consensus Prompt Disperser (CPD) leverages consensus prompts to form task-specific visual consensus prompts, thereby arousing the powerful potential of pre-trained models in addressing CoSOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our concise VCP outperforms 13 cutting-edge full fine-tuning models, achieving the new state of the art (with 6.8% improvement in F_m metrics on the most challenging CoCA dataset).

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We introduce a novel representation for learning and generating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models in the form of $\textit{boundary representations}$ (B-Reps). Our representation unifies the continuous geometric properties of B-Rep primitives in different orders (e.g., surfaces and curves) and their discrete topological relations in a $\textit{holistic latent}$ (HoLa) space. This is based on the simple observation that the topological connection between two surfaces is intrinsically tied to the geometry of their intersecting curve. Such a prior allows us to reformulate topology learning in B-Reps as a geometric reconstruction problem in Euclidean space. Specifically, we eliminate the presence of curves, vertices, and all the topological connections in the latent space by learning to distinguish and derive curve geometries from a pair of surface primitives via a neural intersection network. To this end, our holistic latent space is only defined on surfaces but encodes a full B-Rep model, including the geometry of surfaces, curves, vertices, and their topological relations. Our compact and holistic latent space facilitates the design of a first diffusion-based generator to take on a large variety of inputs including point clouds, single/multi-view images, 2D sketches, and text prompts. Our method significantly reduces ambiguities, redundancies, and incoherences among the generated B-Rep primitives, as well as training complexities inherent in prior multi-step B-Rep learning pipelines, while achieving greatly improved validity rate over current state of the art: 82% vs. $\approx$50%.

- **Summary**: We introduce CrossWKV, a novel cross-attention mechanism for the state-based RWKV-7 model, designed to enhance the expressive power of text-to-image generation. Leveraging RWKV-7's linear-complexity Weighted Key-Value (WKV) architecture, CrossWKV integrates text and image modalities in a single pass, utilizing a generalized delta rule with vector-valued gating and low-rank adaptations (LoRA) to achieve superior cross-modal alignment. Unlike Transformer-based models, CrossWKV's non-diagonal, input-dependent transition matrix enables it to represent complex functions beyond the $\mathrm{TC}^0$ complexity class, including all regular languages, as demonstrated by its ability to perform state-tracking tasks like $S_5$ permutation modeling. Evaluated within the Diffusion in RWKV-7 (DIR-7) on datasets such as LAION-5B and ImageNet, CrossWKV achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 2.88 and a CLIP score of 0.33 on ImageNet 256x256, matching state-of-the-art performance while offering robust generalization across diverse prompts. The model's enhanced expressivity, combined with constant memory usage and linear scaling, positions it as a powerful solution for advanced cross-modal tasks, with potential applications in high-resolution generation and dynamic state manipulation.Code at https://github.com/TorchRWKV/flash-linear-attention

- **Summary**: Video saliency prediction is crucial for downstream applications, such as video compression and human-computer interaction. With the flourishing of multimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency prediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues guide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic guidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to simultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper, and propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts saliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large multimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and introduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate image-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the model to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the textual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another conditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions indicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT) directly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may affect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional guidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information from the timestep. Experimental results show that TAVDiff outperforms existing methods, improving 1.03\%, 2.35\%, 2.71\% and 0.33\% on SIM, CC, NSS and AUC-J metrics, respectively.

- **Summary**: Correlation filter (CF)-based trackers have gained significant attention for their computational efficiency in thermal infrared (TIR) target tracking. However, ex-isting methods struggle with challenges such as low-resolution imagery, occlu-sion, background clutter, and target deformation, which severely impact tracking performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose RAMCT, a region-adaptive sparse correlation filter tracker that integrates multi-channel feature opti-mization with an adaptive regularization strategy. Firstly, we refine the CF learn-ing process by introducing a spatially adaptive binary mask, which enforces spar-sity in the target region while dynamically suppressing background interference. Secondly, we introduce generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) and propose a novel GSVD-based region-adaptive iterative Tikhonov regularization method. This enables flexible and robust optimization across multiple feature channels, improving resilience to occlusion and background variations. Thirdly, we propose an online optimization strategy with dynamic discrepancy-based pa-rameter adjustment. This mechanism facilitates real time adaptation to target and background variations, thereby improving tracking accuracy and robustness. Ex-tensive experiments on LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that RAMCT outperforms other state-of-the-art trackers in terms of accuracy and robustness.

- **Summary**: As machine learning evolves, domain generalization (DG) and domain adaptation (DA) have become crucial for enhancing model robustness across diverse environments. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) plays a significant role in these tasks, offering powerful zero-shot capabilities that allow models to perform effectively in unseen domains. However, there remains a significant gap in the literature, as no comprehensive survey currently exists that systematically explores the applications of CLIP in DG and DA, highlighting the necessity for this review. This survey presents a comprehensive review of CLIP's applications in DG and DA. In DG, we categorize methods into optimizing prompt learning for task alignment and leveraging CLIP as a backbone for effective feature extraction, both enhancing model adaptability. For DA, we examine both source-available methods utilizing labeled source data and source-free approaches primarily based on target domain data, emphasizing knowledge transfer mechanisms and strategies for improved performance across diverse contexts. Key challenges, including overfitting, domain diversity, and computational efficiency, are addressed, alongside future research opportunities to advance robustness and efficiency in practical applications. By synthesizing existing literature and pinpointing critical gaps, this survey provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, proposing directions for effectively leveraging CLIP to enhance methodologies in domain generalization and adaptation. Ultimately, this work aims to foster innovation and collaboration in the quest for more resilient machine learning models that can perform reliably across diverse real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Aiming at the detection difficulties of infrared images such as complex background, low signal-to-noise ratio, small target size and weak brightness, a lightweight infrared small target detection algorithm ISTD-YOLO based on improved YOLOv7 was proposed. Firstly, the YOLOv7 network structure was lightweight reconstructed, and a three-scale lightweight network architecture was designed. Then, the ELAN-W module of the model neck network is replaced by VoV-GSCSP to reduce the computational cost and the complexity of the network structure. Secondly, a parameter-free attention mechanism was introduced into the neck network to enhance the relevance of local con-text information. Finally, the Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) was used to optimize the commonly used IoU index to enhance the localization and detection accuracy of small targets. Experimental results show that compared with YOLOv7 and the current mainstream algorithms, ISTD-YOLO can effectively improve the detection effect, and all indicators are effectively improved, which can achieve high-quality detection of infrared small targets.

- **Summary**: Ensuring the safety of generated content remains a fundamental challenge for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. Existing studies either fail to guarantee complete safety under potentially harmful concepts or struggle to balance safety with generation quality. To address these issues, we propose Safety-Constrained Direct Preference Optimization (SC-DPO), a novel framework for safety alignment in T2I models. SC-DPO integrates safety constraints into the general human preference calibration, aiming to maximize the likelihood of generating human-preferred samples while minimizing the safety cost of the generated outputs. In SC-DPO, we introduce a safety cost model to accurately quantify harmful levels for images, and train it effectively using the proposed contrastive learning and cost anchoring objectives. To apply SC-DPO for effective T2I safety alignment, we constructed SCP-10K, a safety-constrained preference dataset containing rich harmful concepts, which blends safety-constrained preference pairs under both harmful and clean instructions, further mitigating the trade-off between safety and sample quality. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Focusing Mechanism (DFM) for SC-DPO, promoting the model's learning of difficult preference pair samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-DPO outperforms existing methods, effectively defending against various NSFW content while maintaining optimal sample quality and human preference alignment. Additionally, SC-DPO exhibits resilience against adversarial prompts designed to generate harmful content.

- **Summary**: Image completion is a challenging task, particularly when ensuring that generated content seamlessly integrates with existing parts of an image. While recent diffusion models have shown promise, they often struggle with maintaining coherence between known and unknown (missing) regions. This issue arises from the lack of explicit spatial and semantic alignment during the diffusion process, resulting in content that does not smoothly integrate with the original image. Additionally, diffusion models typically rely on global learned distributions rather than localized features, leading to inconsistencies between the generated and existing image parts. In this work, we propose ConFill, a novel framework that introduces a Context-Adaptive Discrepancy (CAD) model to ensure that intermediate distributions of known and unknown regions are closely aligned throughout the diffusion process. By incorporating CAD, our model progressively reduces discrepancies between generated and original images at each diffusion step, leading to contextually aligned completion. Moreover, ConFill uses a new Dynamic Sampling mechanism that adaptively increases the sampling rate in regions with high reconstruction complexity. This approach enables precise adjustments, enhancing detail and integration in restored areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConFill outperforms current methods, setting a new benchmark in image completion.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of video surveillance systems for object detection, tracking, activity recognition, and anomaly detection has revolutionized our day-to-day lives while setting alarms for privacy concerns. It isn't easy to strike a balance between visual privacy and action recognition performance in most computer vision models. Is it possible to safeguard privacy without sacrificing performance? It poses a formidable challenge, as even minor privacy enhancements can lead to substantial performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving image anonymization technique that optimizes the anonymizer using penalties from the utility branch, ensuring improved action recognition performance while minimally affecting privacy leakage. This approach addresses the trade-off between minimizing privacy leakage and maintaining high action performance. The proposed approach is primarily designed to align with the regulatory standards of the EU AI Act and GDPR, ensuring the protection of personally identifiable information while maintaining action performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a feature-based penalty scheme that exclusively controls the action features, allowing freedom to anonymize private attributes. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that applying a penalty to anonymizer from utility branch enhances action performance while maintaining nearly consistent privacy leakage across different penalty settings.

- **Summary**: As an essential procedure in earth observation system, change detection (CD) aims to reveal the spatial-temporal evolution of the observation regions. A key prerequisite for existing change detection algorithms is aligned geo-references between multi-temporal images by fine-grained registration. However, in the majority of real-world scenarios, a prior manual registration is required between the original images, which significantly increases the complexity of the CD workflow. In this paper, we proposed a self-supervision motivated CD framework with geometric estimation, called "MatchCD". Specifically, the proposed MatchCD framework utilizes the zero-shot capability to optimize the encoder with self-supervised contrastive representation, which is reused in the downstream image registration and change detection to simultaneously handle the bi-temporal unalignment and object change issues. Moreover, unlike the conventional change detection requiring segmenting the full-frame image into small patches, our MatchCD framework can directly process the original large-scale image (e.g., 6K*4K resolutions) with promising performance. The performance in multiple complex scenarios with significant geometric distortion demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Thermal infrared (TIR) images typically lack detailed features and have low contrast, making it challenging for conventional feature extraction models to capture discriminative target characteristics. As a result, trackers are often affected by interference from visually similar objects and are susceptible to tracking drift. To address these challenges, we propose a novel saliency-guided Siamese network tracker based on key fine-grained feature infor-mation. First, we introduce a fine-grained feature parallel learning convolu-tional block with a dual-stream architecture and convolutional kernels of varying sizes. This design captures essential global features from shallow layers, enhances feature diversity, and minimizes the loss of fine-grained in-formation typically encountered in residual connections. In addition, we propose a multi-layer fine-grained feature fusion module that uses bilinear matrix multiplication to effectively integrate features across both deep and shallow layers. Next, we introduce a Siamese residual refinement block that corrects saliency map prediction errors using residual learning. Combined with deep supervision, this mechanism progressively refines predictions, ap-plying supervision at each recursive step to ensure consistent improvements in accuracy. Finally, we present a saliency loss function to constrain the sali-ency predictions, directing the network to focus on highly discriminative fi-ne-grained features. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the pro-posed tracker achieves the highest precision and success rates on the PTB-TIR and LSOTB-TIR benchmarks. It also achieves a top accuracy of 0.78 on the VOT-TIR 2015 benchmark and 0.75 on the VOT-TIR 2017 benchmark.

- **Summary**: To address the challenge of capturing highly discriminative features in ther-mal infrared (TIR) tracking, we propose a novel Siamese tracker based on cross-channel fine-grained feature learning and progressive fusion. First, we introduce a cross-channel fine-grained feature learning network that employs masks and suppression coefficients to suppress dominant target features, en-abling the tracker to capture more detailed and subtle information. The net-work employs a channel rearrangement mechanism to enhance efficient in-formation flow, coupled with channel equalization to reduce parameter count. Additionally, we incorporate layer-by-layer combination units for ef-fective feature extraction and fusion, thereby minimizing parameter redun-dancy and computational complexity. The network further employs feature redirection and channel shuffling strategies to better integrate fine-grained details. Second, we propose a specialized cross-channel fine-grained loss function designed to guide feature groups toward distinct discriminative re-gions of the target, thus improving overall target representation. This loss function includes an inter-channel loss term that promotes orthogonality be-tween channels, maximizing feature diversity and facilitating finer detail capture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed tracker achieves the highest accuracy, scoring 0.81 on the VOT-TIR 2015 and 0.78 on the VOT-TIR 2017 benchmark, while also outperforming other methods across all evaluation metrics on the LSOTB-TIR and PTB-TIR benchmarks.

- **Summary**: One-shot controllable video editing (OCVE) is an important yet challenging task, aiming to propagate user edits that are made -- using any image editing tool -- on the first frame of a video to all subsequent frames, while ensuring content consistency between edited frames and source frames. To achieve this, prior methods employ DDIM inversion to transform source frames into latent noise, which is then fed into a pre-trained diffusion model, conditioned on the user-edited first frame, to generate the edited video. However, the DDIM inversion process accumulates errors, which hinder the latent noise from accurately reconstructing the source frames, ultimately compromising content consistency in the generated edited frames. To overcome it, our method eliminates the need for DDIM inversion by performing OCVE through a novel perspective based on visual prompting. Furthermore, inspired by consistency models that can perform multi-step consistency sampling to generate a sequence of content-consistent images, we propose a content consistency sampling (CCS) to ensure content consistency between the generated edited frames and the source frames. Moreover, we introduce a temporal-content consistency sampling (TCS) based on Stein Variational Gradient Descent to ensure temporal consistency across the edited frames. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Climate-smart and biodiversity-preserving forestry demands precise information on forest resources, extending to the individual tree level. Multispectral airborne laser scanning (ALS) has shown promise in automated point cloud processing and tree segmentation, but challenges remain in identifying rare tree species and leveraging deep learning techniques. This study addresses these gaps by conducting a comprehensive benchmark of machine learning and deep learning methods for tree species classification. For the study, we collected high-density multispectral ALS data (>1000 pts/m$^2$) at three wavelengths using the FGI-developed HeliALS system, complemented by existing Optech Titan data (35 pts/m$^2$), to evaluate the species classification accuracy of various algorithms in a test site located in Southern Finland. Based on 5261 test segments, our findings demonstrate that point-based deep learning methods, particularly a point transformer model, outperformed traditional machine learning and image-based deep learning approaches on high-density multispectral point clouds. For the high-density ALS dataset, a point transformer model provided the best performance reaching an overall (macro-average) accuracy of 87.9% (74.5%) with a training set of 1065 segments and 92.0% (85.1%) with 5000 training segments. The best image-based deep learning method, DetailView, reached an overall (macro-average) accuracy of 84.3% (63.9%), whereas a random forest (RF) classifier achieved an overall (macro-average) accuracy of 83.2% (61.3%). Importantly, the overall classification accuracy of the point transformer model on the HeliALS data increased from 73.0% with no spectral information to 84.7% with single-channel reflectance, and to 87.9% with spectral information of all the three channels.

- **Summary**: The emergence of multimodal large language models has redefined the agent paradigm by integrating language and vision modalities with external data sources, enabling agents to better interpret human instructions and execute increasingly complex tasks. However, in this work, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach consists of two key components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to infer the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing injection attacks, achieving at least a +26.4% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.

- **Summary**: There are many ways to describe, name, and group objects when captioning an image. Differences are evident when speakers come from diverse cultures due to the unique experiences that shape perception. Machine translation of captions has pushed multilingual capabilities in vision-language models (VLMs), but data comes mainly from English speakers, indicating a perceptual bias and lack of model flexibility. In this work, we address this challenge and outline a data-efficient framework to instill multilingual VLMs with greater understanding of perceptual diversity. We specifically propose an LLM-based, multimodal recaptioning strategy that alters the object descriptions of English captions before translation. The greatest benefits are demonstrated in a targeted multimodal mechanism guided by native speaker data. By adding produced rewrites as augmentations in training, we improve on German and Japanese text-image retrieval cases studies (up to +3.5 mean recall overall, +4.7 on non-native error cases). We further propose a mechanism to analyze the specific object description differences across datasets, and we offer insights into cross-dataset and cross-language generalization.

- **Summary**: Bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way to extract 3D spatio-temporal features. However, existing 3D SNNs have struggled with long-range dependencies until the recent emergence of Mamba, which offers superior computational efficiency and sequence modeling capability. In this work, we propose Spiking Point Mamba (SPM), the first Mamba-based SNN in the 3D domain. Due to the poor performance of simply transferring Mamba to 3D SNNs, SPM is designed to utilize both the sequence modeling capabilities of Mamba and the temporal feature extraction of SNNs. Specifically, we first introduce Hierarchical Dynamic Encoding (HDE), an improved direct encoding method that effectively introduces dynamic temporal mechanism, thereby facilitating temporal interactions. Then, we propose a Spiking Mamba Block (SMB), which builds upon Mamba while learning inter-time-step features and minimizing information loss caused by spikes. Finally, to further enhance model performance, we adopt an asymmetric SNN-ANN architecture for spike-based pre-training and finetune. Compared with the previous state-of-the-art SNN models, SPM improves OA by +6.2%, +6.1%, and +7.4% on three variants of ScanObjectNN, and boosts instance mIOU by +1.9% on ShapeNetPart. Meanwhile, its energy consumption is at least 3.5x lower than that of its ANN counterpart. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Creating photorealistic 3D head avatars from limited input has become increasingly important for applications in virtual reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While recent advances like neural rendering and 3D Gaussian splatting have enabled high-quality digital human avatar creation and animation, most methods rely on multiple images or multi-view inputs, limiting their practicality for real-world use. In this paper, we propose SEGA, a novel approach for Single-imagE-based 3D drivable Gaussian head Avatar creation that combines generalized prior models with a new hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework. SEGA seamlessly combines priors derived from large-scale 2D datasets with 3D priors learned from multi-view, multi-expression, and multi-ID data, achieving robust generalization to unseen identities while ensuring 3D consistency across novel viewpoints and expressions. We further present a hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework that leverages FLAME-based structural priors and employs a dual-branch architecture to disentangle dynamic and static facial components effectively. The dynamic branch encodes expression-driven fine details, while the static branch focuses on expression-invariant regions, enabling efficient parameter inference and precomputation. This design maximizes the utility of limited 3D data and achieves real-time performance for animation and rendering. Additionally, SEGA performs person-specific fine-tuning to further enhance the fidelity and realism of the generated avatars. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generalization ability, identity preservation, and expression realism, advancing one-shot avatar creation for practical applications.

- **Summary**: Positional embeddings (PE) play a crucial role in Vision Transformers (ViTs) by providing spatial information otherwise lost due to the permutation invariant nature of self attention. While absolute positional embeddings (APE) have shown theoretical advantages over relative positional embeddings (RPE), particularly due to the ability of sinusoidal functions to preserve spatial inductive biases like monotonicity and shift invariance, a fundamental challenge arises when mapping a 2D grid to a 1D sequence. Existing methods have mostly overlooked or never explored the impact of patch ordering in positional embeddings. To address this, we propose LOOPE, a learnable patch-ordering method that optimizes spatial representation for a given set of frequencies, providing a principled approach to patch order optimization. Empirical results show that our PE significantly improves classification accuracy across various ViT architectures. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of positional embeddings, we introduce the "Three Cell Experiment", a novel benchmarking framework that assesses the ability of PEs to retain relative and absolute positional information across different ViT architectures. Unlike standard evaluations, which typically report a performance gap of 4 to 6% between models with and without PE, our method reveals a striking 30 to 35% difference, offering a more sensitive diagnostic tool to measure the efficacy of PEs. Our experimental analysis confirms that the proposed LOOPE demonstrates enhanced effectiveness in retaining both relative and absolute positional information.

- **Summary**: Publicly available biomedical videos, such as those on YouTube, serve as valuable educational resources for medical students. Unlike standard machine learning datasets, these videos are designed for human learners, often mixing medical imagery with narration, explanatory diagrams, and contextual framing. In this work, we investigate whether such pedagogically rich, yet non-standardized and heterogeneous videos can effectively teach general-domain vision-language models biomedical knowledge. To this end, we introduce OpenBiomedVi, a biomedical video instruction tuning dataset comprising 1031 hours of video-caption and Q/A pairs, curated through a multi-step human-in-the-loop pipeline. Diverse biomedical video datasets are rare, and OpenBiomedVid fills an important gap by providing instruction-style supervision grounded in real-world educational content. Surprisingly, despite the informal and heterogeneous nature of these videos, the fine-tuned Qwen-2-VL models exhibit substantial performance improvements across most benchmarks. The 2B model achieves gains of 98.7% on video tasks, 71.2% on image tasks, and 0.2% on text tasks. The 7B model shows improvements of 37.09% on video and 11.2% on image tasks, with a slight degradation of 2.7% on text tasks compared to their respective base models. To address the lack of standardized biomedical video evaluation datasets, we also introduce two new expert curated benchmarks, MIMICEchoQA and SurgeryVideoQA. On these benchmarks, the 2B model achieves gains of 99.1% and 98.1%, while the 7B model shows gains of 22.5% and 52.1%, respectively, demonstrating the models' ability to generalize and perform biomedical video understanding on cleaner and more standardized datasets than those seen during training. These results suggest that educational videos created for human learning offer a surprisingly effective training signal for biomedical VLMs.

- **Summary**: To develop trustworthy Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it is essential to address adversarial robustness and hallucination mitigation, both of which impact factual accuracy in high-stakes applications such as defense and healthcare. Existing methods primarily focus on either adversarial defense or hallucination post-hoc correction, leaving a gap in unified robustness strategies. We introduce \textbf{Hydra}, an adaptive agentic framework that enhances plug-in VLMs through iterative reasoning, structured critiques, and cross-model verification, improving both resilience to adversarial perturbations and intrinsic model errors. Hydra employs an Action-Critique Loop, where it retrieves and critiques visual information, leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) techniques to refine outputs dynamically. Unlike static post-hoc correction methods, Hydra adapts to both adversarial manipulations and intrinsic model errors, making it robust to malicious perturbations and hallucination-related inaccuracies. We evaluate Hydra on four VLMs, three hallucination benchmarks, two adversarial attack strategies, and two adversarial defense methods, assessing performance on both clean and adversarial inputs. Results show that Hydra surpasses plug-in VLMs and state-of-the-art (SOTA) dehallucination methods, even without explicit adversarial defenses, demonstrating enhanced robustness and factual consistency. By bridging adversarial resistance and hallucination mitigation, Hydra provides a scalable, training-free solution for improving the reliability of VLMs in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: The increasing demand for AR/VR applications has highlighted the need for high-quality 360-degree panoramic content. However, generating high-quality 360-degree panoramic images and videos remains a challenging task due to the severe distortions introduced by equirectangular projection (ERP). Existing approaches either fine-tune pretrained diffusion models on limited ERP datasets or attempt tuning-free methods that still rely on ERP latent representations, leading to discontinuities near the poles. In this paper, we introduce SphereDiff, a novel approach for seamless 360-degree panoramic image and video generation using state-of-the-art diffusion models without additional tuning. We define a spherical latent representation that ensures uniform distribution across all perspectives, mitigating the distortions inherent in ERP. We extend MultiDiffusion to spherical latent space and propose a spherical latent sampling method to enable direct use of pretrained diffusion models. Moreover, we introduce distortion-aware weighted averaging to further improve the generation quality in the projection process. Our method outperforms existing approaches in generating 360-degree panoramic content while maintaining high fidelity, making it a robust solution for immersive AR/VR applications.

We first pre-train a neural acoustic field conditioned by room geometry on an external large-scale dataset in which pairs of RIRs and the geometries are provided. The neural acoustic field is then adapted to each target room by using the enrollment data, where we leverage either the provided room geometries or geometries retrieved from the external dataset, depending on availability. Lastly, we predict the RIRs for each pair of source and receiver locations specified by Task 1, and use these RIRs to train the speaker distance estimation model in Task 2.

- **Summary**: Visual object tracking is a crucial research topic in the fields of computer vision and multi-modal fusion. Among various approaches, robust visual tracking that combines RGB frames with Event streams has attracted increasing attention from researchers. While striving for high accuracy and efficiency in tracking, it is also important to explore how to effectively conduct adversarial attacks and defenses on RGB-Event stream tracking algorithms, yet research in this area remains relatively scarce. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a cross-modal adversarial attack algorithm for RGB-Event visual tracking. Because of the diverse representations of Event streams, and given that Event voxels and frames are more commonly used, this paper will focus on these two representations for an in-depth study. Specifically, for the RGB-Event voxel, we first optimize the perturbation by adversarial loss to generate RGB frame adversarial examples. For discrete Event voxel representations, we propose a two-step attack strategy, more in detail, we first inject Event voxels into the target region as initialized adversarial examples, then, conduct a gradient-guided optimization by perturbing the spatial location of the Event voxels. For the RGB-Event frame based tracking, we optimize the cross-modal universal perturbation by integrating the gradient information from multimodal data. We evaluate the proposed approach against attacks on three widely used RGB-Event Tracking datasets, i.e., COESOT, FE108, and VisEvent. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces the performance of the tracker across numerous datasets in both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.
