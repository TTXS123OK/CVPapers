- **Summary**: We present Variational Self-Supervised Learning (VSSL), a novel framework that combines variational inference with self-supervised learning to enable efficient, decoder-free representation learning. Unlike traditional VAEs that rely on input reconstruction via a decoder, VSSL symmetrically couples two encoders with Gaussian outputs. A momentum-updated teacher network defines a dynamic, data-dependent prior, while the student encoder produces an approximate posterior from augmented views. The reconstruction term in the ELBO is replaced with a cross-view denoising objective, preserving the analytical tractability of Gaussian KL divergence. We further introduce cosine-based formulations of KL and log-likelihood terms to enhance semantic alignment in high-dimensional latent spaces. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 show that VSSL achieves competitive or superior performance to leading self-supervised methods, including BYOL and MoCo V3. VSSL offers a scalable, probabilistically grounded approach to learning transferable representations without generative reconstruction, bridging the gap between variational modeling and modern self-supervised techniques.

- **Summary**: Medical image analysis is a fundamental component. As deep learning progresses, the focus has shifted from single-task applications, such as classification and segmentation, to more complex multimodal tasks, including medical visual question answering and report generation. Traditional shallow and task-specific models are increasingly limited in addressing the complexity and scalability required in clinical practice. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has driven the development of medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), offering a unified solution for diverse vision-language tasks. In this study, we investigate various architectural designs for medical LVLMs based on the widely adopted LLaVA framework, which follows an encoder-connector-LLM paradigm. We construct two distinct models targeting 2D and 3D modalities, respectively. These models are designed to support both general-purpose medical tasks and domain-specific fine-tuning, thereby serving as effective foundation models. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we develop a modular and extensible codebase, MedM-VL, and release two LVLM variants: MedM-VL-2D for 2D medical image analysis and MedM-VL-CT-Chest for 3D CT-based applications. The code and models are available at: https://github.com/MSIIP/MedM-VL

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicle (AV) stacks have traditionally relied on decomposed approaches, with separate modules handling perception, prediction, and planning. However, this design introduces information loss during inter-module communication, increases computational overhead, and can lead to compounding errors. To address these challenges, recent works have proposed architectures that integrate all components into an end-to-end differentiable model, enabling holistic system optimization. This shift emphasizes data engineering over software integration, offering the potential to enhance system performance by simply scaling up training resources. In this work, we evaluate the performance of a simple end-to-end driving architecture on internal driving datasets ranging in size from 16 to 8192 hours with both open-loop metrics and closed-loop simulations. Specifically, we investigate how much additional training data is needed to achieve a target performance gain, e.g., a 5% improvement in motion prediction accuracy. By understanding the relationship between model performance and training dataset size, we aim to provide insights for data-driven decision-making in autonomous driving development.



### NCL-CIR: Noise-aware Contrastive Learning for Composed Image Retrieval

- **Summary**: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) seeks to find a target image using a multi-modal query, which combines an image with modification text to pinpoint the target. While recent CIR methods have shown promise, they mainly focus on exploring relationships between the query pairs (image and text) through data augmentation or model design. These methods often assume perfect alignment between queries and target images, an idealized scenario rarely encountered in practice. In reality, pairs are often partially or completely mismatched due to issues like inaccurate modification texts, low-quality target images, and annotation errors. Ignoring these mismatches leads to numerous False Positive Pair (FFPs) denoted as noise pairs in the dataset, causing the model to overfit and ultimately reducing its performance. To address this problem, we propose the Noise-aware Contrastive Learning for CIR (NCL-CIR), comprising two key components: the Weight Compensation Block (WCB) and the Noise-pair Filter Block (NFB). The WCB coupled with diverse weight maps can ensure more stable token representations of multi-modal queries and target images. Meanwhile, the NFB, in conjunction with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) predicts noise pairs by evaluating loss distributions, and generates soft labels correspondingly, allowing for the design of the soft-label based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss function. Consequently, the overall architecture helps to mitigate the influence of mismatched and partially matched samples, with experimental results demonstrating that NCL-CIR achieves exceptional performance on the benchmark datasets.

  Synthetic Visual Datasets (SyntaGen)
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Anomaly generation is an effective way to mitigate data scarcity for anomaly detection task. Most existing works shine at industrial anomaly generation with multiple specialists or large generative models, rarely generalizing to anomalies in other applications. In this paper, we present AnomalyHybrid, a domain-agnostic framework designed to generate authentic and diverse anomalies simply by combining the reference and target images. AnomalyHybrid is a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)-based framework having two decoders that integrate the appearance of reference image into the depth and edge structures of target image respectively. With the help of depth decoders, AnomalyHybrid achieves authentic generation especially for the anomalies with depth values changing, such a s protrusion and dent. More, it relaxes the fine granularity structural control of the edge decoder and brings more diversity. Without using annotations, AnomalyHybrid is easily trained with sets of color, depth and edge of same images having different augmentations. Extensive experiments carried on HeliconiusButterfly, MVTecAD and MVTec3D datasets demonstrate that AnomalyHybrid surpasses the GAN-based state-of-the-art on anomaly generation and its downstream anomaly classification, detection and segmentation tasks. On MVTecAD dataset, AnomalyHybrid achieves 2.06/0.32 IS/LPIPS for anomaly generation, 52.6 Acc for anomaly classification with ResNet34, 97.3/72.9 AP for image/pixel-level anomaly detection with a simple UNet.

- **Summary**: The advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have led to a growing interest in autonomous driving to leverage their strong reasoning capabilities. However, extending these capabilities from 2D to full 3D understanding is crucial for real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose OmniDrive, a holistic vision-language dataset that aligns agent models with 3D driving tasks through counterfactual reasoning. This approach enhances decision-making by evaluating potential scenarios and their outcomes, similar to human drivers considering alternative actions. Our counterfactual-based synthetic data annotation process generates large-scale, high-quality datasets, providing denser supervision signals that bridge planning trajectories and language-based reasoning. Futher, we explore two advanced OmniDrive-Agent frameworks, namely Omni-L and Omni-Q, to assess the importance of vision-language alignment versus 3D perception, revealing critical insights into designing effective LLM-agents. Significant improvements on the DriveLM Q\&A benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and methods.

- **Summary**: Identifying an appropriate radius for unbiased kernel estimation is crucial for the efficiency of radiance estimation. However, determining both the radius and unbiasedness still faces big challenges. In this paper, we first propose a statistical model of photon samples and associated contributions for progressive kernel estimation, under which the kernel estimation is unbiased if the null hypothesis of this statistical model stands. Then, we present a method to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis about the statistical population (i.e., photon samples) by the F-test in the Analysis of Variance. Hereby, we implement a progressive photon mapping (PPM) algorithm, wherein the kernel radius is determined by this hypothesis test for unbiased radiance estimation. Secondly, we propose VCM+, a reinforcement of Vertex Connection and Merging (VCM), and derive its theoretically unbiased formulation. VCM+ combines hypothesis testing-based PPM with bidirectional path tracing (BDPT) via multiple importance sampling (MIS), wherein our kernel radius can leverage the contributions from PPM and BDPT. We test our new algorithms, improved PPM and VCM+, on diverse scenarios with different lighting settings. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can alleviate light leaks and visual blur artifacts of prior radiance estimate algorithms. We also evaluate the asymptotic performance of our approach and observe an overall improvement over the baseline in all testing scenarios.

- **Summary**: We introduce UniToken, an auto-regressive generation model that encodes visual inputs through a combination of discrete and continuous representations, enabling seamless integration of unified visual understanding and image generation tasks. Unlike previous approaches that rely on unilateral visual representations, our unified visual encoding framework captures both high-level semantics and low-level details, delivering multidimensional information that empowers heterogeneous tasks to selectively assimilate domain-specific knowledge based on their inherent characteristics. Through in-depth experiments, we uncover key principles for developing a unified model capable of both visual understanding and image generation. Extensive evaluations across a diverse range of prominent benchmarks demonstrate that UniToken achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches. These results establish UniToken as a robust foundation for future research in this domain. The code and models are available at https://github.com/SxJyJay/UniToken.

- **Summary**: Generating consecutive images of lip movements that align with a given speech in audio-driven lip synthesis is a challenging task. While previous studies have made strides in synchronization and visual quality, lip intelligibility and video fluency remain persistent challenges. This work proposes FluentLip, a two-stage approach for audio-driven lip synthesis, incorporating three featured strategies. To improve lip synchronization and intelligibility, we integrate a phoneme extractor and encoder to generate a fusion of audio and phoneme information for multimodal learning. Additionally, we employ optical flow consistency loss to ensure natural transitions between image frames. Furthermore, we incorporate a diffusion chain during the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve both stability and efficiency. We evaluate our proposed FluentLip through extensive experiments, comparing it with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across five metrics, including a proposed metric called Phoneme Error Rate (PER) that evaluates lip pose intelligibility and video fluency. The experimental results demonstrate that our FluentLip approach is highly competitive, achieving significant improvements in smoothness and naturalness. In particular, it outperforms these SOTA approaches by approximately $\textbf{16.3%}$ in Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and $\textbf{35.2%}$ in PER.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for image segmentation algorithms, encompassing naive methods, machine learning approaches, and deep learning techniques. We begin by introducing the fundamental concepts and importance of image segmentation, and the role of interactive segmentation in enhancing accuracy. A detailed background theory section explores various segmentation methods, including thresholding, edge detection, region growing, feature extraction, random forests, support vector machines, convolutional neural networks, U-Net, and Mask R-CNN. The implementation and experimental setup are thoroughly described, highlighting three primary approaches: algorithm assisting user, user assisting algorithm, and hybrid methods. Evaluation metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), computation time, and user interaction time are employed to measure performance. A comparative analysis presents detailed results, emphasizing the strengths, limitations, and trade-offs of each method. The paper concludes with insights into the practical applicability of these approaches across various scenarios and outlines future work, focusing on expanding datasets, developing more representative approaches, integrating real-time feedback, and exploring weakly supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms to enhance segmentation accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: In the European Union, buildings account for 42% of energy use and 35% of greenhouse gas emissions. Since most existing buildings will still be in use by 2050, retrofitting is crucial for emissions reduction. However, current building assessment methods rely mainly on qualitative thermal imaging, which limits data-driven decisions for energy savings. On the other hand, quantitative assessments using finite element analysis (FEA) offer precise insights but require manual CAD design, which is tedious and error-prone. Recent advances in 3D reconstruction, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, enable precise 3D modeling from sparse images but lack clearly defined volumes and the interfaces between them needed for FEA. We propose Thermoxels, a novel voxel-based method able to generate FEA-compatible models, including both geometry and temperature, from a sparse set of RGB and thermal images. Using pairs of RGB and thermal images as input, Thermoxels represents a scene's geometry as a set of voxels comprising color and temperature information. After optimization, a simple process is used to transform Thermoxels' models into tetrahedral meshes compatible with FEA. We demonstrate Thermoxels' capability to generate RGB+Thermal meshes of 3D scenes, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. To showcase the practical applications of Thermoxels' models, we conduct a simple heat conduction simulation using FEA, achieving convergence from an initial state defined by Thermoxels' thermal reconstruction. Additionally, we compare Thermoxels' image synthesis abilities with current state-of-the-art methods, showing competitive results, and discuss the limitations of existing metrics in assessing mesh quality.

- **Summary**: Despite the advancements in 3D full-shape generation, accurately modeling complex geometries and semantics of shape parts remains a significant challenge, particularly for shapes with varying numbers of parts. Current methods struggle to effectively integrate the contextual and structural information of 3D shapes into their generative processes. We address these limitations with PRISM, a novel compositional approach for 3D shape generation that integrates categorical diffusion models with Statistical Shape Models (SSM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). Our method employs compositional SSMs to capture part-level geometric variations and uses GMM to represent part semantics in a continuous space. This integration enables both high fidelity and diversity in generated shapes while preserving structural coherence. Through extensive experiments on shape generation and manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods in both quality and controllability of part-level operations. Our code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) research faces significant challenges due to fragmented toolchains, complex system configurations, and inconsistent evaluation methodologies. To address these issues, we present VSLAM-LAB, a unified framework designed to streamline the development, evaluation, and deployment of VSLAM systems. VSLAM-LAB simplifies the entire workflow by enabling seamless compilation and configuration of VSLAM algorithms, automated dataset downloading and preprocessing, and standardized experiment design, execution, and evaluation--all accessible through a single command-line interface. The framework supports a wide range of VSLAM systems and datasets, offering broad compatibility and extendability while promoting reproducibility through consistent evaluation metrics and analysis tools. By reducing implementation complexity and minimizing configuration overhead, VSLAM-LAB empowers researchers to focus on advancing VSLAM methodologies and accelerates progress toward scalable, real-world solutions.

- **Summary**: Imbalanced datasets pose a considerable challenge in training deep learning (DL) models for medical diagnostics, particularly for segmentation tasks. Imbalance may be associated with annotation quality limited annotated datasets, rare cases, or small-scale regions of interest (ROIs). These conditions adversely affect model training and performance, leading to segmentation boundaries which deviate from the true ROIs. Traditional loss functions, such as Binary Cross Entropy, replicate annotation biases and limit model generalization. We propose a novel, statistically driven, conditionally adaptive loss function (CALF) tailored to accommodate the conditions of imbalanced datasets in DL training. It employs a data-driven methodology by estimating imbalance severity using statistical methods of skewness and kurtosis, then applies an appropriate transformation to balance the training dataset while preserving data heterogeneity. This transformative approach integrates a multifaceted process, encompassing preprocessing, dataset filtering, and dynamic loss selection to achieve optimal outcomes. We benchmark our method against conventional loss functions using qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Experiments using large-scale open-source datasets (i.e., UPENN-GBM, UCSF, LGG, and BraTS) validate our approach, demonstrating substantial segmentation improvements.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including complex and sparse ground object distributions, small clustered structures, and elongated multi-branch features that often lead to missing detections. To better adapt to ground object distributions and achieve adaptive dynamic feature responses while skipping redundant information, this paper proposes a Spatial-Geometry Enhanced 3D Dynamic Snake Network (SG-DSCNet) based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model. The network employs Dynamic Snake Convolution (DSCConv), which introduces deformable offsets to enhance kernel flexibility through constrained self-learning, thereby improving regional perception of ground objects. Additionally, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that generates multiple morphological kernel templates from DSCConv to observe target structures from different perspectives and achieve efficient feature fusion through summarizing key characteristics. This dynamic approach enables the model to focus more flexibly on critical spatial structures when processing different regions, rather than relying on fixed receptive fields of single static kernels. The DSC module enhances model representation capability through dynamic kernel aggregation without increasing network depth or width. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on the IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral classification methods.

- **Summary**: The challenge of Domain Generalization (DG) in Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is the significant interference of domain-specific signals on subtle spoofing clues. Recently, some CLIP-based algorithms have been developed to alleviate this interference by adjusting the weights of visual classifiers. However, our analysis of this class-wise prompt engineering suffers from two shortcomings for DG FAS: (1) The categories of facial categories, such as real or spoof, have no semantics for the CLIP model, making it difficult to learn accurate category descriptions. (2) A single form of prompt cannot portray the various types of spoofing. In this work, instead of class-wise prompts, we propose a novel Content-aware Composite Prompt Engineering (CCPE) that generates instance-wise composite prompts, including both fixed template and learnable prompts. Specifically, our CCPE constructs content-aware prompts from two branches: (1) Inherent content prompt explicitly benefits from abundant transferred knowledge from the instruction-based Large Language Model (LLM). (2) Learnable content prompts implicitly extract the most informative visual content via Q-Former. Moreover, we design a Cross-Modal Guidance Module (CGM) that dynamically adjusts unimodal features for fusion to achieve better generalized FAS. Finally, our CCPE has been validated for its effectiveness in multiple cross-domain experiments and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

- **Summary**: Long video understanding has emerged as an increasingly important yet challenging task in computer vision. Agent-based approaches are gaining popularity for processing long videos, as they can handle extended sequences and integrate various tools to capture fine-grained information. However, existing methods still face several challenges: (1) they often rely solely on the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) without dedicated mechanisms to enhance reasoning in long video scenarios; and (2) they remain vulnerable to errors or noise from external tools. To address these issues, we propose a specialized chain-of-thought (CoT) process tailored for long video analysis. Our proposed CoT with plan-adjust mode enables the LLM to incrementally plan and adapt its information-gathering strategy. We further incorporate heuristic uncertainty estimation of both the LLM and external tools to guide the CoT process. This allows the LLM to assess the reliability of newly collected information, refine its collection strategy, and make more robust decisions when synthesizing final answers. Empirical experiments show that our uncertainty-aware CoT effectively mitigates noise from external tools, leading to more reliable outputs. We implement our approach in a system called VideoAgent2, which also includes additional modules such as general context acquisition and specialized tool design. Evaluation on three dedicated long video benchmarks (and their subsets) demonstrates that VideoAgent2 outperforms the previous state-of-the-art agent-based method, VideoAgent, by an average of 13.1% and achieves leading performance among all zero-shot approaches

- **Summary**: Instance segmentation plays a pivotal role in medical image analysis by enabling precise localization and delineation of lesions, tumors, and anatomical structures. Although deep learning models such as Mask R-CNN and BlendMask have achieved remarkable progress, their application in high-risk medical scenarios remains constrained by confidence calibration issues, which may lead to misdiagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose a robust quality control framework based on conformal prediction theory. This framework innovatively constructs a risk-aware dynamic threshold mechanism that adaptively adjusts segmentation decision boundaries according to clinical requirements.Specifically, we design a \textbf{calibration-aware loss function} that dynamically tunes the segmentation threshold based on a user-defined risk level $\alpha$. Utilizing exchangeable calibration data, this method ensures that the expected FNR or FDR on test data remains below $\alpha$ with high probability. The framework maintains compatibility with mainstream segmentation models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, BlendMask+ResNet-50-FPN) and datasets (PASCAL VOC format) without requiring architectural modifications. Empirical results demonstrate that we rigorously bound the FDR metric marginally over the test set via our developed calibration framework.

- **Summary**: LLM-driven autonomous agents have emerged as a promising direction in recent years. However, many of these LLM agents are designed empirically or based on intuition, often lacking systematic design principles, which results in diverse agent structures with limited generality and scalability. In this paper, we advocate for building LLM agents by incorporating insights from computer systems. Inspired by the von Neumann architecture, we propose a structured framework for LLM agentic systems, emphasizing modular design and universal principles. Specifically, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of LLM agents from the computer system perspective, then identifies key challenges and future directions inspired by computer system design, and finally explores the learning mechanisms for LLM agents beyond the computer system. The insights gained from this comparative analysis offer a foundation for systematic LLM agent design and advancement.

- **Summary**: Humans develop certain cognitive abilities to recognize objects and their transformations without explicit supervision, highlighting the importance of unsupervised representation learning. A fundamental challenge in unsupervised representation learning is to separate different transformations in learned feature representations. Although algebraic approaches have been explored, a comprehensive theoretical framework remains underdeveloped. Existing methods decompose transformations based on algebraic independence, but these methods primarily focus on commutative transformations and do not extend to cases where transformations are conditionally independent but noncommutative. To extend current representation learning frameworks, we draw inspiration from Galois theory, where the decomposition of groups through normal subgroups provides an approach for the analysis of structured transformations. Normal subgroups naturally extend commutativity under certain conditions and offer a foundation for the categorization of transformations, even when they do not commute. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages normal subgroups to enable the separation of conditionally independent transformations, even in the absence of commutativity. Through experiments on geometric transformations in images, we show that our method successfully categorizes conditionally independent transformations, such as rotation and translation, in an unsupervised manner, suggesting a close link between group decomposition via normal subgroups and transformation categorization in representation learning.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of skin color measurement methods from dermatoscopic images using a synthetic dataset (S-SYNTH) with controlled ground-truth melanin content, lesion shapes, hair models, and 18 distinct lighting conditions. This allows for rigorous assessment of the robustness and invariance to lighting conditions. We assess four classes of image colorimetry approaches: segmentation-based, patch-based, color quantization, and neural networks. We use these methods to estimate the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) and Fitzpatrick types from dermatoscopic images. Our results show that segmentation-based and color quantization methods yield robust, lighting-invariant estimates, whereas patch-based approaches exhibit significant lighting-dependent biases that require calibration. Furthermore, neural network models, particularly when combined with heavy blurring to reduce overfitting, can provide light-invariant Fitzpatrick predictions, although their generalization to real-world images remains unverified. We conclude with practical recommendations for designing fair and reliable skin color estimation methods.

- **Summary**: With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.

- **Summary**: Active Learning (AL) aims to reduce annotation costs by strategically selecting the most informative samples for labeling. However, most active learning methods struggle in the low-budget regime where only a few labeled examples are available. This issue becomes even more pronounced when annotators provide noisy labels. A common AL approach for the low- and mid-budget regimes focuses on maximizing the coverage of the labeled set across the entire dataset. We propose a novel framework called Noise-Aware Active Sampling (NAS) that extends existing greedy, coverage-based active learning strategies to handle noisy annotations. NAS identifies regions that remain uncovered due to the selection of noisy representatives and enables resampling from these areas. We introduce a simple yet effective noise filtering approach suitable for the low-budget regime, which leverages the inner mechanism of NAS and can be applied for noise filtering before model training. On multiple computer vision benchmarks, including CIFAR100 and ImageNet subsets, NAS significantly improves performance for standard active learning methods across different noise types and rates.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot domain-specific image classification is challenging in classifying real images without ground-truth in-domain training examples. Recent research involved knowledge from texts with a text-to-image model to generate in-domain training images in zero-shot scenarios. However, existing methods heavily rely on simple prompt strategies, limiting the diversity of synthetic training images, thus leading to inferior performance compared to real images. In this paper, we propose AttrSyn, which leverages large language models to generate attributed prompts. These prompts allow for the generation of more diverse attributed synthetic images. Experiments for zero-shot domain-specific image classification on two fine-grained datasets show that training with synthetic images generated by AttrSyn significantly outperforms CLIP's zero-shot classification under most situations and consistently surpasses simple prompt strategies.

- **Summary**: Foundation models pretrained on extensive datasets, such as GroundingDINO and LAE-DINO, have performed remarkably in the cross-domain few-shot object detection (CD-FSOD) task. Through rigorous few-shot training, we found that the integration of image-based data augmentation techniques and grid-based sub-domain search strategy significantly enhances the performance of these foundation models. Building upon GroundingDINO, we employed several widely used image augmentation methods and established optimization objectives to effectively navigate the expansive domain space in search of optimal sub-domains. This approach facilitates efficient few-shot object detection and introduces an approach to solving the CD-FSOD problem by efficiently searching for the optimal parameter configuration from the foundation model. Our findings substantially advance the practical deployment of vision-language models in data-scarce environments, offering critical insights into optimizing their cross-domain generalization capabilities without labor-intensive retraining.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) enables robust single-object tracking using segmentation. To extend this to multi-object tracking (MOT), we propose SAM2MOT, introducing a novel Tracking by Segmentation paradigm. Unlike Tracking by Detection or Tracking by Query, SAM2MOT directly generates tracking boxes from segmentation masks, reducing reliance on detection accuracy. SAM2MOT has two key advantages: zero-shot generalization, allowing it to work across datasets without fine-tuning, and strong object association, inherited from SAM2. To further improve performance, we integrate a trajectory manager system for precise object addition and removal, and a cross-object interaction module to handle occlusions. Experiments on DanceTrack, UAVDT, and BDD100K show state-of-the-art results. Notably, SAM2MOT outperforms existing methods on DanceTrack by +2.1 HOTA and +4.5 IDF1, highlighting its effectiveness in MOT.

- **Summary**: Accurate brain tumor diagnosis relies on the assessment of multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences. However, in clinical practice, the acquisition of certain sequences may be affected by factors like motion artifacts or contrast agent contraindications, leading to suboptimal outcome, such as poor image quality. This can then affect image interpretation by radiologists. Synthesizing high quality MRI sequences has thus become a critical research focus. Though recent advancements in controllable generative AI have facilitated the synthesis of diagnostic quality MRI, ensuring anatomical accuracy remains a significant challenge. Preserving critical structural relationships between different anatomical regions is essential, as even minor structural or topological inconsistencies can compromise diagnostic validity. In this work, we propose BrainMRDiff, a novel topology-preserving, anatomy-guided diffusion model for synthesizing brain MRI, leveraging brain and tumor anatomies as conditioning inputs. To achieve this, we introduce two key modules: Tumor+Structure Aggregation (TSA) and Topology-Guided Anatomy Preservation (TGAP). TSA integrates diverse anatomical structures with tumor information, forming a comprehensive conditioning mechanism for the diffusion process. TGAP enforces topological consistency during reverse denoising diffusion process; both these modules ensure that the generated image respects anatomical integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMRDiff surpasses existing baselines, achieving performance improvements of 23.33% on the BraTS-AG dataset and 33.33% on the BraTS-Met dataset. Code will be made publicly available soon.

- **Summary**: Energy-efficient image acquisition on the edge is crucial for enabling remote sensing applications where the sensor node has weak compute capabilities and must transmit data to a remote server/cloud for processing. To reduce the edge energy consumption, this paper proposes a sensor-algorithm co-designed system called SnapPix, which compresses raw pixels in the analog domain inside the sensor. We use coded exposure (CE) as the in-sensor compression strategy as it offers the flexibility to sample, i.e., selectively expose pixels, both spatially and temporally. SNAPPIX has three contributions. First, we propose a task-agnostic strategy to learn the sampling/exposure pattern based on the classic theory of efficient coding. Second, we co-design the downstream vision model with the exposure pattern to address the pixel-level non-uniformity unique to CE-compressed images. Finally, we propose lightweight augmentations to the image sensor hardware to support our in-sensor CE compression. Evaluating on action recognition and video reconstruction, SnapPix outperforms state-of-the-art video-based methods at the same speed while reducing the energy by up to 15.4x. We have open-sourced the code at: https://github.com/horizon-research/SnapPix.

- **Summary**: 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) leveraging spatial information in point clouds for 3D spatial reasoning attract great attention. Despite some promising results, the role of point clouds in 3D spatial reasoning remains under-explored. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate and analyze these models to answer the research question: \textit{Does point cloud truly boost the spatial reasoning capacities of 3D LLMs?} We first evaluate the spatial reasoning capacity of LLMs with different input modalities by replacing the point cloud with the visual and text counterparts. We then propose a novel 3D QA (Question-answering) benchmark, ScanReQA, that comprehensively evaluates models' understanding of binary spatial relationships. Our findings reveal several critical insights: 1) LLMs without point input could even achieve competitive performance even in a zero-shot manner; 2) existing 3D LLMs struggle to comprehend the binary spatial relationships; 3) 3D LLMs exhibit limitations in exploiting the structural coordinates in point clouds for fine-grained spatial reasoning. We think these conclusions can help the next step of 3D LLMs and also offer insights for foundation models in other modalities. We release datasets and reproducible codes in the anonymous project page: https://3d-llm.xyz.

- **Summary**: While deep learning has exhibited remarkable predictive capabilities in various medical image tasks, its inherent black-box nature has hindered its widespread implementation in real-world healthcare settings. Our objective is to unveil the decision-making processes of deep learning models in the context of glaucoma classification by employing several Class Activation Map (CAM) techniques to generate model focus regions and comparing them with clinical domain knowledge of the anatomical area (optic cup, optic disk, and blood vessels). Four deep neural networks, including VGG-11, ResNet-18, DeiT-Tiny, and Swin Transformer-Tiny, were developed using binary diagnostic labels of glaucoma and five CAM methods (Grad-CAM, XGrad-CAM, Score-CAM, Eigen-CAM, and Layer-CAM) were employed to highlight the model focus area. We applied the paired-sample t-test to compare the percentage of anatomies in the model focus area to the proportion of anatomies in the entire image. After that, Pearson's and Spearman's correlation tests were implemented to examine the relationship between model predictive ability and the percentage of anatomical structures in the model focus area. On five public glaucoma datasets, all deep learning models consistently displayed statistically significantly higher percentages of anatomical structures in the focus area than the proportions of anatomical structures in the entire image. Also, we validated the positive relationship between the percentage of anatomical structures in the focus area and model predictive performance. Our study provides evidence of the convergence of decision logic between deep neural networks and human clinicians through rigorous statistical tests. We anticipate that it can help alleviate clinicians' concerns regarding the trustworthiness of deep learning in healthcare. For reproducibility, the code and dataset have been released at GitHub.

- **Summary**: Egocentric Video Question Answering (QA) requires models to handle long-horizon temporal reasoning, first-person perspectives, and specialized challenges like frequent camera movement. This paper systematically evaluates both proprietary and open-source Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on QaEgo4Dv2 - a refined dataset of egocentric videos derived from QaEgo4D. Four popular MLLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Video-LLaVa-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct) are assessed using zero-shot and fine-tuned approaches for both OpenQA and CloseQA settings. We introduce QaEgo4Dv2 to mitigate annotation noise in QaEgo4D, enabling more reliable comparison. Our results show that fine-tuned Video-LLaVa-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct achieve new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous benchmarks by up to +2.6% ROUGE/METEOR (for OpenQA) and +13% accuracy (for CloseQA). We also present a thorough error analysis, indicating the model's difficulty in spatial reasoning and fine-grained object recognition - key areas for future improvement.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning in medical image segmentation leverages unlabeled data to reduce annotation burdens through consistency learning. However, current methods struggle with class imbalance and high uncertainty from pathology variations, leading to inaccurate segmentation in 3D medical images. To address these challenges, we present DyCON, a Dynamic Uncertainty-aware Consistency and Contrastive Learning framework that enhances the generalization of consistency methods with two complementary losses: Uncertainty-aware Consistency Loss (UnCL) and Focal Entropy-aware Contrastive Loss (FeCL). UnCL enforces global consistency by dynamically weighting the contribution of each voxel to the consistency loss based on its uncertainty, preserving high-uncertainty regions instead of filtering them out. Initially, UnCL prioritizes learning from uncertain voxels with lower penalties, encouraging the model to explore challenging regions. As training progress, the penalty shift towards confident voxels to refine predictions and ensure global consistency. Meanwhile, FeCL enhances local feature discrimination in imbalanced regions by introducing dual focal mechanisms and adaptive confidence adjustments into the contrastive principle. These mechanisms jointly prioritizes hard positives and negatives while focusing on uncertain sample pairs, effectively capturing subtle lesion variations under class imbalance. Extensive evaluations on four diverse medical image segmentation datasets (ISLES'22, BraTS'19, LA, Pancreas) show DyCON's superior performance against SOTA methods.

- **Summary**: Precise video retrieval requires multi-modal correlations to handle unseen vocabulary and scenes, becoming more complex for lengthy videos where models must perform effectively without prior training on a specific dataset. We introduce a unified framework that combines a visual matching stream and an aural matching stream with a unique subtitles-based video segmentation approach. Additionally, the aural stream includes a complementary audio-based two-stage retrieval mechanism that enhances performance on long-duration videos. Considering the complex nature of retrieval from lengthy videos and its corresponding evaluation, we introduce a new retrieval evaluation method specifically designed for long-video retrieval to support further research. We conducted experiments on the YouCook2 benchmark, showing promising retrieval performance.

- **Summary**: Generative diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools to synthetically produce training data, offering potential solutions to data scarcity and reducing labelling costs for downstream supervised deep learning applications. However, effectively leveraging text-conditioned image generation for building classifier training sets requires addressing key issues: constructing informative textual prompts, adapting generative models to specific domains, and ensuring robust performance. This paper proposes the Text-Conditioned Knowledge Recycling (TCKR) pipeline to tackle these challenges. TCKR combines dynamic image captioning, parameter-efficient diffusion model fine-tuning, and Generative Knowledge Distillation techniques to create synthetic datasets tailored for image classification. The pipeline is rigorously evaluated on ten diverse image classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that models trained solely on TCKR-generated data achieve classification accuracies on par with (and in several cases exceeding) models trained on real images. Furthermore, the evaluation reveals that these synthetic-data-trained models exhibit substantially enhanced privacy characteristics: their vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks is significantly reduced, with the membership inference AUC lowered by 5.49 points on average compared to using real training data, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the performance-privacy trade-off. These findings indicate that high-fidelity synthetic data can effectively replace real data for training classifiers, yielding strong performance whilst simultaneously providing improved privacy protection as a valuable emergent property. The code and trained models are available in the accompanying open-source repository.

- **Summary**: We present a targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method that jointly optimizes sensor poses and scene geometry from arbitrary scenes, without relying on traditional calibration targets such as checkerboards or spherical reflectors. Our approach leverages a 3D Gaussian-based scene representation. We first freeze reliable LiDAR points as anchors, then jointly optimize the poses and auxiliary Gaussian parameters in a fully differentiable manner using a photometric loss. This joint optimization significantly reduces sensor misalignment, resulting in higher rendering quality and consistently improved PSNR compared to the carefully calibrated poses provided in popular datasets. We validate our method through extensive experiments on two real-world autonomous driving datasets, KITTI-360 and Waymo, each featuring distinct sensor configurations. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach using a custom LiDAR-camera setup, confirming strong performance across diverse hardware configurations.

- **Summary**: The effectiveness of autonomous vehicles relies on reliable perception capabilities. Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence and sensor fusion technologies, current single-vehicle perception systems continue to encounter limitations, notably visual occlusions and limited long-range detection capabilities. Collaborative Perception (CP), enabled by Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues and enhance the reliability of autonomous systems. Beyond advancements in communication, the computer vision community is increasingly focusing on improving vehicular perception through collaborative approaches. However, a systematic literature review that thoroughly examines existing work and reduces subjective bias is still lacking. Such a systematic approach helps identify research gaps, recognize common trends across studies, and inform future research directions. In response, this study follows the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and includes 106 peer-reviewed articles. These publications are analyzed based on modalities, collaboration schemes, and key perception tasks. Through a comparative analysis, this review illustrates how different methods address practical issues such as pose errors, temporal latency, communication constraints, domain shifts, heterogeneity, and adversarial attacks. Furthermore, it critically examines evaluation methodologies, highlighting a misalignment between current metrics and CP's fundamental objectives. By delving into all relevant topics in-depth, this review offers valuable insights into challenges, opportunities, and risks, serving as a reference for advancing research in vehicular collaborative perception.

- **Summary**: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) is a vital capability for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), allowing task adaptation via contextual prompts without parameter retraining. However, its application is hindered by the token-intensive nature of inputs and the high complexity of cross-modal few-shot learning, which limits the expressive power of representation methods. To tackle these challenges, we propose \textbf{M2IV}, a method that substitutes explicit demonstrations with learnable \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{V}ectors directly integrated into LVLMs. By exploiting the complementary strengths of multi-head attention (\textbf{M}HA) and multi-layer perceptrons (\textbf{M}LP), M2IV achieves robust cross-modal fidelity and fine-grained semantic distillation through training. This significantly enhances performance across diverse LVLMs and tasks and scales efficiently to many-shot scenarios, bypassing the context window limitations. We also introduce \textbf{VLibrary}, a repository for storing and retrieving M2IV, enabling flexible LVLM steering for tasks like cross-modal alignment, customized generation and safety improvement. Experiments across seven benchmarks and three LVLMs show that M2IV surpasses Vanilla ICL and prior representation engineering approaches, with an average accuracy gain of \textbf{3.74\%} over ICL with the same shot count, alongside substantial efficiency advantages.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in dance generation have enabled automatic synthesis of 3D dance motions. However, existing methods still struggle to produce high-fidelity dance sequences that simultaneously deliver exceptional realism, precise dance-music synchronization, high motion diversity, and physical plausibility. Moreover, existing methods lack the flexibility to edit dance sequences according to diverse guidance signals, such as musical prompts, pose constraints, action labels, and genre descriptions, significantly restricting their creative utility and adaptability. Unlike the existing approaches, DanceMosaic enables fast and high-fidelity dance generation, while allowing multimodal motion editing. Specifically, we propose a multimodal masked motion model that fuses the text-to-motion model with music and pose adapters to learn probabilistic mapping from diverse guidance signals to high-quality dance motion sequences via progressive generative masking training. To further enhance the motion generation quality, we propose multimodal classifier-free guidance and inference-time optimization mechanism that further enforce the alignment between the generated motions and the multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance in dance generation, significantly advancing the quality and editability achieved by existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has been successfully applied to medical image segmentation, enabling accurate identification of regions of interest such as organs and lesions. This approach works effectively across diverse datasets, including those with single-image contrast, multi-contrast, and multimodal imaging data. To improve human understanding of these black-box models, there is a growing need for Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for model transparency and accountability. Previous research has primarily focused on post hoc pixel-level explanations, using methods gradient-based and perturbation-based apporaches. These methods rely on gradients or perturbations to explain model predictions. However, these pixel-level explanations often struggle with the complexity inherent in multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation tasks, and the sparsely distributed explanations have limited clinical relevance. In this study, we propose using contrast-level Shapley values to explain state-of-the-art models trained on standard metrics used in brain tumor segmentation. Our results demonstrate that Shapley analysis provides valuable insights into different models' behavior used for tumor segmentation. We demonstrated a bias for U-Net towards over-weighing T1-contrast and FLAIR, while Swin-UNETR provided a cross-contrast understanding with balanced Shapley distribution.
