- **Summary**: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have advanced medical image segmentation, they face inherent limitations such as local receptive fields in CNNs and high computational complexity in ViTs. This paper introduces Deconver, a novel network that integrates traditional deconvolution techniques from image restoration as a core learnable component within a U-shaped architecture. Deconver replaces computationally expensive attention mechanisms with efficient nonnegative deconvolution (NDC) operations, enabling the restoration of high-frequency details while suppressing artifacts. Key innovations include a backpropagation-friendly NDC layer based on a provably monotonic update rule and a parameter-efficient design. Evaluated across four datasets (ISLES'22, BraTS'23, GlaS, FIVES) covering both 2D and 3D segmentation tasks, Deconver achieves state-of-the-art performance in Dice scores and Hausdorff distance while reducing computational costs (FLOPs) by up to 90% compared to leading baselines. By bridging traditional image restoration with deep learning, this work offers a practical solution for high-precision segmentation in resource-constrained clinical workflows.

- **Summary**: One-shot learning focuses on adapting pretrained models to recognize newly introduced and unseen classes based on a single labeled image. While variations of few-shot and zero-shot learning exist, one-shot learning remains a challenging yet crucial problem due to its ability to generalize knowledge to unseen classes from just one human-annotated image. In this paper, we introduce a transductive one-shot learning approach that employs subspace decomposition to utilize the information from labeled images in the support set and unlabeled images in the query set. These images are decomposed into a linear combination of latent variables representing primitives captured by smaller subspaces. By representing images in the query set as linear combinations of these latent primitives, we can propagate the label from a single image in the support set to query images that share similar combinations of primitives. Through a comprehensive quantitative analysis across various neural network feature extractors and datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can effectively generalize to novel classes from just one labeled image.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in zero-shot referring image segmentation (RIS), driven by models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and CLIP, have made substantial progress in aligning visual and textual information. Despite these successes, the extraction of precise and high-quality mask region representations remains a critical challenge, limiting the full potential of RIS tasks. In this paper, we introduce a training-free, hybrid global-local feature extraction approach that integrates detailed mask-specific features with contextual information from the surrounding area, enhancing mask region representation. To further strengthen alignment between mask regions and referring expressions, we propose a spatial guidance augmentation strategy that improves spatial coherence, which is essential for accurately localizing described areas. By incorporating multiple spatial cues, this approach facilitates more robust and precise referring segmentation. Extensive experiments on standard RIS benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing zero-shot RIS models, achieving substantial performance gains. We believe our approach advances RIS tasks and establishes a versatile framework for region-text alignment, offering broader implications for cross-modal understanding and interaction.

- **Summary**: Event-based vision sensors, inspired by biological neural systems, asynchronously capture local pixel-level intensity changes as a sparse event stream containing position, polarity, and timestamp information. These neuromorphic sensors offer significant advantages in dynamic range, latency, and power efficiency. Their working principle inherently addresses traditional camera limitations such as motion blur and redundant background information, making them particularly suitable for dynamic vision tasks. While recent works have proposed increasingly complex event-based architectures, the computational overhead and parameter complexity of these approaches limit their practical deployment. This paper presents a novel spatiotemporal learning framework for event-based object recognition, utilizing a VGG network enhanced with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). Our approach achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art ResNet-based methods while reducing parameter count by 2.3% compared to the original VGG model. Specifically, it outperforms ResNet-based methods like MVF-Net, achieving the highest Top-1 accuracy of 76.4% (pretrained) and 71.3% (not pretrained) on CIFAR10-DVS, and 72.4% (not pretrained) on N-Caltech101. These results highlight the robustness of our method when pretrained weights are not used, making it suitable for scenarios where transfer learning is unavailable. Moreover, our approach reduces reliance on data augmentation. Experimental results on standard event-based datasets demonstrate the framework's efficiency and effectiveness for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a prompt-guided video foundation model, has remarkably performed in video object segmentation, drawing significant attention in the community. Due to the high similarity between camouflaged objects and their surroundings, which makes them difficult to distinguish even by the human eye, the application of SAM2 for automated segmentation in real-world scenarios faces challenges in camouflage perception and reliable prompts generation. To address these issues, we propose CamoSAM2, a motion-appearance prompt inducer (MAPI) and refinement framework to automatically generate and refine prompts for SAM2, enabling high-quality automatic detection and segmentation in VCOD task. Initially, we introduce a prompt inducer that simultaneously integrates motion and appearance cues to detect camouflaged objects, delivering more accurate initial predictions than existing methods. Subsequently, we propose a video-based adaptive multi-prompts refinement (AMPR) strategy tailored for SAM2, aimed at mitigating prompt error in initial coarse masks and further producing good prompts. Specifically, we introduce a novel three-step process to generate reliable prompts by camouflaged object determination, pivotal prompting frame selection, and multi-prompts formation. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model, CamoSAM2, significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving increases of 8.0% and 10.1% in mIoU metric. Additionally, our method achieves the fastest inference speed compared to current VCOD models.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving visual question answering (AD-VQA) aims to answer questions related to perception, prediction, and planning based on given driving scene images, heavily relying on the model's spatial understanding capabilities. Prior works typically express spatial information through textual representations of coordinates, resulting in semantic gaps between visual coordinate representations and textual descriptions. This oversight hinders the accurate transmission of spatial information and increases the expressive burden. To address this, we propose a novel Marker-based Prompt learning framework (MPDrive), which represents spatial coordinates by concise visual markers, ensuring linguistic expressive consistency and enhancing the accuracy of both visual perception and spatial expression in AD-VQA. Specifically, we create marker images by employing a detection expert to overlay object regions with numerical labels, converting complex textual coordinate generation into straightforward text-based visual marker predictions. Moreover, we fuse original and marker images as scene-level features and integrate them with detection priors to derive instance-level features. By combining these features, we construct dual-granularity visual prompts that stimulate the LLM's spatial perception capabilities. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM and CODA-LM datasets show that MPDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in cases requiring sophisticated spatial understanding.



### Hierarchical Flow Diffusion for Efficient Frame Interpolation

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Most recent diffusion-based methods still show a large gap compared to non-diffusion methods for video frame interpolation, in both accuracy and efficiency. Most of them formulate the problem as a denoising procedure in latent space directly, which is less effective caused by the large latent space. We propose to model bilateral optical flow explicitly by hierarchical diffusion models, which has much smaller search space in the denoising procedure. Based on the flow diffusion model, we then use a flow-guided images synthesizer to produce the final result. We train the flow diffusion model and the image synthesizer end to end. Our method achieves state of the art in accuracy, and 10+ times faster than other diffusion-based methods. The project page is at: https://hfd-interpolation.github.io.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving systems. However, LiDAR point clouds may appear to have sparsity, uneven distribution, and incomplete structures, significantly limiting the detection performance. In road driving environments, target objects referring to vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists are well-suited for enhancing representation through the complete template guidance, considering their grid and topological structures. Therefore, this paper presents an intrinsic-feature-guided 3D object detection method based on a template-assisted feature enhancement module, which extracts intrinsic features from relatively generalized templates and provides rich structural information for foreground objects. Furthermore, a proposal-level contrastive learning mechanism is designed to enhance the feature differences between foreground and background objects. The proposed modules can act as plug-and-play components and improve the performance of multiple existing methods. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed method achieves the highly competitive detection results. Code will be available at https://github.com/zhangwanjingjj/IfgNet.git.

- **Summary**: Document shadows are a major obstacle in the digitization process. Due to the dense information in text and patterns covered by shadows, document shadow removal requires specialized methods. Existing document shadow removal methods, although showing some progress, still rely on additional information such as shadow masks or lack generalization and effectiveness across different shadow scenarios. This often results in incomplete shadow removal or loss of original document content and tones. Moreover, these methods tend to underutilize the information present in the original shadowed document image. In this paper, we refocus our approach on the document images themselves, which inherently contain rich information.We propose an end-to-end document shadow removal method guided by contrast representation, following a coarse-to-fine refinement approach. By extracting document contrast information, we can effectively and quickly locate shadow shapes and positions without the need for additional masks. This information is then integrated into the refined shadow removal process, providing better guidance for network-based removal and feature fusion. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: The reconstruction of immersive and realistic 3D scenes holds significant practical importance in various fields of computer vision and computer graphics. Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U. Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then, we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE, while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction, which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites. The implementation code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/Scene4U .

- **Summary**: The task of 2D animal pose estimation plays a crucial role in advancing deep learning applications in animal behavior analysis and ecological research. Despite notable progress in some existing approaches, our study reveals that the scarcity of high-quality datasets remains a significant bottleneck, limiting the full potential of current methods. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Controllable Image Generation Pipeline for synthesizing animal pose estimation data, termed AP-CAP. Within this pipeline, we introduce a Multi-Modal Animal Image Generation Model capable of producing images with expected poses. To enhance the quality and diversity of the generated data, we further propose three innovative strategies: (1) Modality-Fusion-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to integrate multi-source appearance representations, (2) Pose-Adjustment-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to dynamically capture diverse pose variations, and (3) Caption-Enhancement-Based Animal Image Synthesis Strategy to enrich visual semantic understanding. Leveraging the proposed model and strategies, we create the MPCH Dataset (Modality-Pose-Caption Hybrid), the first hybrid dataset that innovatively combines synthetic and real data, establishing the largest-scale multi-source heterogeneous benchmark repository for animal pose estimation to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in improving both the performance and generalization capability of animal pose estimators.

- **Summary**: While fine-tuning pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models on portrait datasets enables attribute customization, existing methods suffer from Semantic Pollution that compromises the original model's behavior and prevents incremental learning. To address this, we propose SPF-Portrait, a pioneering work to purely understand customized semantics while eliminating semantic pollution in text-driven portrait customization. In our SPF-Portrait, we propose a dual-path pipeline that introduces the original model as a reference for the conventional fine-tuning path. Through contrastive learning, we ensure adaptation to target attributes and purposefully align other unrelated attributes with the original portrait. We introduce a novel Semantic-Aware Fine Control Map, which represents the precise response regions of the target semantics, to spatially guide the alignment process between the contrastive paths. This alignment process not only effectively preserves the performance of the original model but also avoids over-alignment. Furthermore, we propose a novel response enhancement mechanism to reinforce the performance of target attributes, while mitigating representation discrepancy inherent in direct cross-modal supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPF-Portrait achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Images captured under real-world low-light conditions face significant challenges due to uneven ambient lighting, making it difficult for existing end-to-end methods to enhance images with a large dynamic range to normal exposure levels. To address the above issue, we propose a novel brightness-adaptive enhancement framework designed to tackle the challenge of local exposure inconsistencies in real-world low-light images. Specifically, our proposed framework comprises two components: the Local Contrast Enhancement Network (LCEN) and the Global Illumination Guidance Network (GIGN). We introduce an early stopping mechanism in the LCEN and design a local discriminative module, which adaptively perceives the contrast of different areas in the image to control the premature termination of the enhancement process for patches with varying exposure levels. Additionally, within the GIGN, we design a global attention guidance module that effectively models global illumination by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information within the image, which guides the local contrast enhancement network to significantly improve brightness across different regions. Finally, in order to coordinate the LCEN and GIGN, we design a novel training strategy to facilitate the training process. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

- **Summary**: Wide-angle cameras, despite their popularity for content creation, suffer from distortion-induced facial stretching-especially at the edge of the lens-which degrades visual appeal. To address this issue, we propose an image portrait correction framework using diffusion models named ImagePD. It integrates the long-range awareness of transformer and multi-step denoising of diffusion models into a unified framework, achieving global structural robustness and local detail refinement. Besides, considering the high cost of obtaining video labels, we then repurpose ImagePD for unlabeled wide-angle videos (termed VideoPD), by spatiotemporal diffusion adaption with spatial consistency and temporal smoothness constraints. For the former, we encourage the denoised image to approximate pseudo labels following the wide-angle distortion distribution pattern, while for the latter, we derive rectification trajectories with backward optical flows and smooth them. Compared with ImagePD, VideoPD maintains high-quality facial corrections in space and mitigates the potential temporal shakes sequentially. Finally, to establish an evaluation benchmark and train the framework, we establish a video portrait dataset with a large diversity in people number, lighting conditions, and background. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing solutions quantitatively and qualitatively, contributing to high-fidelity wide-angle videos with stable and natural portraits. The codes and dataset will be available.

- **Summary**: Scene text image super-resolution (STISR) enhances the resolution and quality of low-resolution images. Unlike previous studies that treated scene text images as natural images, recent methods using a text prior (TP), extracted from a pre-trained text recognizer, have shown strong performance. However, two major issues emerge: (1) Explicit categorical priors, like TP, can negatively impact STISR if incorrect. We reveal that these explicit priors are unstable and propose replacing them with Non-CAtegorical Prior (NCAP) using penultimate layer representations. (2) Pre-trained recognizers used to generate TP struggle with low-resolution images. To address this, most studies jointly train the recognizer with the STISR network to bridge the domain gap between low- and high-resolution images, but this can cause an overconfidence phenomenon in the prior modality. We highlight this issue and propose a method to mitigate it by mixing hard and soft labels. Experiments on the TextZoom dataset demonstrate an improvement by 3.5%, while our method significantly enhances generalization performance by 14.8\% across four text recognition datasets. Our method generalizes to all TP-guided STISR networks.

- **Summary**: This study used machine learning algorithms to identify actors and extract the age of actors from images taken randomly from movies. The use of images taken from Arab movies includes challenges such as non-uniform lighting, different and multiple poses for the actors and multiple elements with the actor or a group of actors. Additionally, the use of make-up, wigs, beards, and wearing different accessories and costumes made it difficult for the system to identify the personality of the same actor. The Arab Actors Dataset-AAD comprises 574 images sourced from various movies, encompassing both black and white as well as color compositions. The images depict complete scenes or fragments thereof. Multiple models were employed for feature extraction, and diverse machine learning algorithms were utilized during the classification and prediction stages to determine the most effective algorithm for handling such image types. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of the Logistic Regression model exhibited the best performance compared to other models in the training phase, as evidenced by its AUC, precision, CA and F1score values of 99%, 86%, 85.5% and 84.2% respectively. The findings of this study can be used to improve the precision and reliability of facial recognition technology for various uses as with movies search services, movie suggestion algorithms, and genre classification of movies.

- **Summary**: Building a lifelong robot that can effectively leverage prior knowledge for continuous skill acquisition remains significantly challenging. Despite the success of experience replay and parameter-efficient methods in alleviating catastrophic forgetting problem, naively applying these methods causes a failure to leverage the shared primitives between skills. To tackle these issues, we propose Primitive Prompt Learning (PPL), to achieve lifelong robot manipulation via reusable and extensible primitives. Within our two stage learning scheme, we first learn a set of primitive prompts to represent shared primitives through multi-skills pre-training stage, where motion-aware prompts are learned to capture semantic and motion shared primitives across different skills. Secondly, when acquiring new skills in lifelong span, new prompts are appended and optimized with frozen pretrained prompts, boosting the learning via knowledge transfer from old skills to new ones. For evaluation, we construct a large-scale skill dataset and conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating PPL's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This study presents an empirical case study to assess the efficacy and reliability of DeepSeek-V3, an emerging large language model, within the context of computer education. The evaluation employs both CCNA simulation questions and real-world inquiries concerning computer network security posed by Chinese network engineers. To ensure a thorough evaluation, diverse dimensions are considered, encompassing role dependency, cross-linguistic proficiency, and answer reproducibility, accompanied by statistical analysis. The findings demonstrate that the model performs consistently, regardless of whether prompts include a role definition or not. In addition, its adaptability across languages is confirmed by maintaining stable accuracy in both original and translated datasets. A distinct contrast emerges between its performance on lower-order factual recall tasks and higher-order reasoning exercises, which underscores its strengths in retrieving information and its limitations in complex analytical tasks. Although DeepSeek-V3 offers considerable practical value for network security education, challenges remain in its capability to process multimodal data and address highly intricate topics. These results provide valuable insights for future refinement of large language models in specialized professional environments.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks pose a critical security threat to real-world AI systems by injecting human-imperceptible perturbations into benign samples to induce misclassification in deep learning models. While existing detection methods, such as Bayesian uncertainty estimation and activation pattern analysis, have achieved progress through feature engineering, their reliance on handcrafted feature design and prior knowledge of attack patterns limits generalization capabilities and incurs high engineering costs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight adversarial detection framework based on the large-scale pre-trained vision-language model CLIP. Departing from conventional adversarial feature characterization paradigms, we innovatively adopt an anomaly detection perspective. By jointly fine-tuning CLIP's dual visual-text encoders with trainable adapter networks and learnable prompts, we construct a compact representation space tailored for natural images. Notably, our detection architecture achieves substantial improvements in generalization capability across both known and unknown attack patterns compared to traditional methods, while significantly reducing training overhead. This study provides a novel technical pathway for establishing a parameter-efficient and attack-agnostic defense paradigm, markedly enhancing the robustness of vision systems against evolving adversarial threats.

- **Summary**: Identity-preserving face synthesis aims to generate synthetic face images of virtual subjects that can substitute real-world data for training face recognition models. While prior arts strive to create images with consistent identities and diverse styles, they face a trade-off between them. Identifying their limitation of treating style variation as subject-agnostic and observing that real-world persons actually have distinct, subject-specific styles, this paper introduces MorphFace, a diffusion-based face generator. The generator learns fine-grained facial styles, e.g., shape, pose and expression, from the renderings of a 3D morphable model (3DMM). It also learns identities from an off-the-shelf recognition model. To create virtual faces, the generator is conditioned on novel identities of unlabeled synthetic faces, and novel styles that are statistically sampled from a real-world prior distribution. The sampling especially accounts for both intra-subject variation and subject distinctiveness. A context blending strategy is employed to enhance the generator's responsiveness to identity and style conditions. Extensive experiments show that MorphFace outperforms the best prior arts in face recognition efficacy.

- **Summary**: With the advancements in medical artificial intelligence (AI), fundus image classifiers are increasingly being applied to assist in ophthalmic diagnosis. While existing classification models have achieved high accuracy on specific fundus datasets, they struggle to address real-world challenges such as variations in image quality across different imaging devices, discrepancies between training and testing images across different racial groups, and the uncertain boundaries due to the characteristics of glaucomatous cases. In this study, we aim to address the above challenges posed by image variations by highlighting the importance of incorporating comprehensive fundus image information, including the optic cup (OC) and optic disc (OD) regions, and other key image patches. Specifically, we propose a self-adaptive attention window that autonomously determines optimal boundaries for enhanced feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a multi-head attention mechanism to effectively fuse global and local features via feature linear readout, improving the model's discriminative capability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy and robustness in glaucoma classification.

- **Summary**: Decoding visual experiences from brain activity is a significant challenge. Existing fMRI-to-video methods often focus on semantic content while overlooking spatial and motion information. However, these aspects are all essential and are processed through distinct pathways in the brain. Motivated by this, we propose DecoFuse, a novel brain-inspired framework for decoding videos from fMRI signals. It first decomposes the video into three components - semantic, spatial, and motion - then decodes each component separately before fusing them to reconstruct the video. This approach not only simplifies the complex task of video decoding by decomposing it into manageable sub-tasks, but also establishes a clearer connection between learned representations and their biological counterpart, as supported by ablation studies. Further, our experiments show significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 82.4% accuracy for semantic classification, 70.6% accuracy in spatial consistency, a 0.212 cosine similarity for motion prediction, and 21.9% 50-way accuracy for video generation. Additionally, neural encoding analyses for semantic and spatial information align with the two-streams hypothesis, further validating the distinct roles of the ventral and dorsal pathways. Overall, DecoFuse provides a strong and biologically plausible framework for fMRI-to-video decoding. Project page: https://chongjg.github.io/DecoFuse/.

- **Summary**: We present a novel approach, termed ADGaussian, for generalizable street scene reconstruction. The proposed method enables high-quality rendering from single-view input. Unlike prior Gaussian Splatting methods that primarily focus on geometry refinement, we emphasize the importance of joint optimization of image and depth features for accurate Gaussian prediction. To this end, we first incorporate sparse LiDAR depth as an additional input modality, formulating the Gaussian prediction process as a joint learning framework of visual information and geometric clue. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature matching strategy coupled with a multi-scale Gaussian decoding model to enhance the joint refinement of multi-modal features, thereby enabling efficient multi-modal Gaussian learning. Extensive experiments on two large-scale autonomous driving datasets, Waymo and KITTI, demonstrate that our ADGaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization capabilities in novel-view shifting.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of wearable technology has established multi-device ecosystems comprising smartphones, smartwatches, and headphones as critical enablers for ubiquitous pedestrian localization. However, traditional pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) struggles with diverse motion modes, while data-driven methods, despite improving accuracy, often lack robustness due to their reliance on a single-device setup. Therefore, a promising solution is to fully leverage existing wearable devices to form a flexiwear bodynet for robust and accurate pedestrian localization. This paper presents Suite-IN++, a deep learning framework for flexiwear bodynet-based pedestrian localization. Suite-IN++ integrates motion data from wearable devices on different body parts, using contrastive learning to separate global and local motion features. It fuses global features based on the data reliability of each device to capture overall motion trends and employs an attention mechanism to uncover cross-device correlations in local features, extracting motion details helpful for accurate localization. To evaluate our method, we construct a real-life flexiwear bodynet dataset, incorporating Apple Suite (iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods) across diverse walking modes and device configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that Suite-IN++ achieves superior localization accuracy and robustness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models in real-life pedestrian tracking scenarios.

- **Summary**: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have become foundational models for document understanding tasks, widely used in the processing of complex multimodal documents across domains such as finance, law, and academia. However, documents often contain noise-like information, such as watermarks, which inevitably leads us to inquire: \emph{Do watermarks degrade the performance of VLMs in document understanding?} To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to investigate the effect of visible watermarks on VLMs performance. We takes into account various factors, including different types of document data, the positions of watermarks within documents and variations in watermark content. Our experimental results reveal that VLMs performance can be significantly compromised by watermarks, with performance drop rates reaching up to 36\%. We discover that \emph{scattered} watermarks cause stronger interference than centralized ones, and that \emph{semantic contents} in watermarks creates greater disruption than simple visual occlusion. Through attention mechanism analysis and embedding similarity examination, we find that the performance drops are mainly attributed to that watermarks 1) force widespread attention redistribution, and 2) alter semantic representation in the embedding space. Our research not only highlights significant challenges in deploying VLMs for document understanding, but also provides insights towards developing robust inference mechanisms on watermarked documents.

- **Summary**: Facial recognition systems are vulnerable to physical (e.g., printed photos) and digital (e.g., DeepFake) face attacks. Existing methods struggle to simultaneously detect physical and digital attacks due to: 1) significant intra-class variations between these attack types, and 2) the inadequacy of spatial information alone to comprehensively capture live and fake cues. To address these issues, we propose a unified attack detection model termed Frequency-Aware and Attack-Agnostic CLIP (FA\textsuperscript{3}-CLIP), which introduces attack-agnostic prompt learning to express generic live and fake cues derived from the fusion of spatial and frequency features, enabling unified detection of live faces and all categories of attacks. Specifically, the attack-agnostic prompt module generates generic live and fake prompts within the language branch to extract corresponding generic representations from both live and fake faces, guiding the model to learn a unified feature space for unified attack detection. Meanwhile, the module adaptively generates the live/fake conditional bias from the original spatial and frequency information to optimize the generic prompts accordingly, reducing the impact of intra-class variations. We further propose a dual-stream cues fusion framework in the vision branch, which leverages frequency information to complement subtle cues that are difficult to capture in the spatial domain. In addition, a frequency compression block is utilized in the frequency stream, which reduces redundancy in frequency features while preserving the diversity of crucial cues. We also establish new challenging protocols to facilitate unified face attack detection effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves performance in detecting physical and digital face attacks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: We introduce DD3G, a formulation that Distills a multi-view Diffusion model (MV-DM) into a 3D Generator using gaussian splatting. DD3G compresses and integrates extensive visual and spatial geometric knowledge from the MV-DM by simulating its ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory, ensuring the distilled generator generalizes better than those trained solely on 3D data. Unlike previous amortized optimization approaches, we align the MV-DM and 3D generator representation spaces to transfer the teacher's probabilistic flow to the student, thus avoiding inconsistencies in optimization objectives caused by probabilistic sampling. The introduction of probabilistic flow and the coupling of various attributes in 3D Gaussians introduce challenges in the generation process. To tackle this, we propose PEPD, a generator consisting of Pattern Extraction and Progressive Decoding phases, which enables efficient fusion of probabilistic flow and converts a single image into 3D Gaussians within 0.06 seconds. Furthermore, to reduce knowledge loss and overcome sparse-view supervision, we design a joint optimization objective that ensures the quality of generated samples through explicit supervision and implicit verification. Leveraging existing 2D generation models, we compile 120k high-quality RGBA images for distillation. Experiments on synthetic and public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Facial recognition systems in real-world scenarios are susceptible to both digital and physical attacks. Previous methods have attempted to achieve classification by learning a comprehensive feature space. However, these methods have not adequately accounted for the inherent characteristics of physical and digital attack data, particularly the large intra class variation in attacks and the small inter-class variation between live and fake faces. To address these limitations, we propose the Fine-Grained MoE with Class-Aware Regularization CLIP framework (FG-MoE-CLIP-CAR), incorporating key improvements at both the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, we employ a Soft Mixture of Experts (Soft MoE) architecture to leverage different experts for specialized feature processing. Additionally, we refine the Soft MoE to capture more subtle differences among various types of fake faces. At the loss level, we introduce two constraint modules: the Disentanglement Module (DM) and the Cluster Distillation Module (CDM). The DM enhances class separability by increasing the distance between the centers of live and fake face classes. However, center-to-center constraints alone are insufficient to ensure distinctive representations for individual features. Thus, we propose the CDM to further cluster features around their respective class centers while maintaining separation from other classes. Moreover, specific attacks that significantly deviate from common attack patterns are often overlooked. To address this issue, our distance calculation prioritizes more distant features. Experimental results on two unified physical-digital attack datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

- **Summary**: Existing state-of-the-art AI-Generated image detection methods mostly consider extracting low-level information from RGB images to help improve the generalization of AI-Generated image detection, such as noise patterns. However, these methods often consider only a single type of low-level information, which may lead to suboptimal generalization. Through empirical analysis, we have discovered a key insight: different low-level information often exhibits generalization capabilities for different types of forgeries. Furthermore, we found that simple fusion strategies are insufficient to leverage the detection advantages of each low-level and high-level information for various forgery types. Therefore, we propose the Adaptive Low-level Experts Injection (ALEI) framework. Our approach introduces Lora Experts, enabling the backbone network, which is trained with high-level semantic RGB images, to accept and learn knowledge from different low-level information. We utilize a cross-attention method to adaptively fuse these features at intermediate layers. To prevent the backbone network from losing the modeling capabilities of different low-level features during the later stages of modeling, we developed a Low-level Information Adapter that interacts with the features extracted by the backbone network. Finally, we propose Dynamic Feature Selection, which dynamically selects the most suitable features for detecting the current image to maximize generalization detection capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, finetuned on only four categories of mainstream ProGAN data, performs excellently and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets containing unseen GAN and Diffusion methods.

- **Summary**: To develop a trustworthy AI system, which aim to identify the input regions that most influence the models decisions. The primary task of existing attribution methods lies in efficiently and accurately identifying the relationships among input-prediction interactions. Particularly when the input data is discrete, such as images, analyzing the relationship between inputs and outputs poses a significant challenge due to the combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient black-box attribution mechanism, LiMA (Less input is More faithful for Attribution), which reformulates the attribution of important regions as an optimization problem for submodular subset selection. First, to accurately assess interactions, we design a submodular function that quantifies subset importance and effectively captures their impact on decision outcomes. Then, efficiently ranking input sub-regions by their importance for attribution, we improve optimization efficiency through a novel bidirectional greedy search algorithm. LiMA identifies both the most and least important samples while ensuring an optimal attribution boundary that minimizes errors. Extensive experiments on eight foundation models demonstrate that our method provides faithful interpretations with fewer regions and exhibits strong generalization, shows an average improvement of 36.3% in Insertion and 39.6% in Deletion. Our method also outperforms the naive greedy search in attribution efficiency, being 1.6 times faster. Furthermore, when explaining the reasons behind model prediction errors, the average highest confidence achieved by our method is, on average, 86.1% higher than that of state-of-the-art attribution algorithms.

- **Summary**: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is a challenging task that requires the model to segment the object in a video given the language description. MeViS is a recently proposed dataset that contains motion expressions of the target objects, leading to a challenging benchmark, compared with existing RVOS benchmarks. On the other hand, for referring expression tasks, a new trend is to adopt multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to achieve better image and text alignment. In this report, we show that with a simple modification to the test time inference method on stronger MLLMs, we can lead to stronger results on MeVIS. In particular, we adopt the recent method Sa2VA, a unified model for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. By enlarging the scope of key frames, without any further training, we can achieve the 3rd place in the 4th PVUW workshop.

- **Summary**: Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS), which focuses on segmenting new classes in images using only a limited number of annotated examples, has recently progressed in data-scarce domains. However, in this work, we show that the existing FSS methods often struggle to generalize to underwater environments. Specifically, the prior features extracted by pre-trained models used as feature extractors are fragile due to the unique challenges of underwater images. To address this, we propose FSSUWNet, a tailored FSS framework for underwater images with feature enhancement. FSSUWNet exploits the integration of complementary features, emphasizing both low-level and high-level image characteristics. In addition to employing a pre-trained model as the primary encoder, we propose an auxiliary encoder called Feature Enhanced Encoder which extracts complementary features to better adapt to underwater scene characteristics. Furthermore, a simple and effective Feature Alignment Module aims to provide global prior knowledge and align low-level features with high-level features in dimensions. Given the scarcity of underwater images, we introduce a cross-validation dataset version based on the Segmentation of Underwater Imagery dataset. Extensive experiments on public underwater segmentation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, our method outperforms the previous best method by 2.8% and 2.6% in terms of the mean Intersection over Union metric for 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios in the datasets, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/lizhh268/FSSUWNet.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a deep hierarchical attention context model for lossless attribute compression of point clouds, leveraging a multi-resolution spatial structure and residual learning. A simple and effective Level of Detail (LoD) structure is introduced to yield a coarse-to-fine representation. To enhance efficiency, points within the same refinement level are encoded in parallel, sharing a common context point group. By hierarchically aggregating information from neighboring points, our attention model learns contextual dependencies across varying scales and densities, enabling comprehensive feature extraction. We also adopt normalization for position coordinates and attributes to achieve scale-invariant compression. Additionally, we segment the point cloud into multiple slices to facilitate parallel processing, further optimizing time complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers better coding performance than the latest G-PCC for color and reflectance attributes while maintaining more efficient encoding and decoding runtimes.

- **Summary**: Multimodal models integrating speech and vision hold significant potential for advancing human-computer interaction, particularly in Speech-Based Visual Question Answering (SBVQA) where spoken questions about images require direct audio-visual understanding. Existing approaches predominantly focus on text-visual integration, leaving speech-visual modality gaps underexplored due to their inherent heterogeneity. To this end, we introduce SViQA, a unified speech-vision model that directly processes spoken questions without text transcription. Building upon the LLaVA architecture, our framework bridges auditory and visual modalities through two key innovations: (1) end-to-end speech feature extraction eliminating intermediate text conversion, and (2) cross-modal alignment optimization enabling effective fusion of speech signals with visual content. Extensive experimental results on the SBVQA benchmark demonstrate the proposed SViQA's state-of-the-art performance, achieving 75.62% accuracy, and competitive multimodal generalization. Leveraging speech-text mixed input boosts performance to 78.85%, a 3.23% improvement over pure speech input, highlighting SViQA's enhanced robustness and effective cross-modal attention alignment.

- **Summary**: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging multimodal reasoning task requiring intelligent systems to answer natural language queries based on paired audio-video inputs accurately. However, existing AVQA approaches often suffer from overfitting to dataset biases, leading to poor robustness. Moreover, current datasets may not effectively diagnose these methods. To address these challenges, we first introduce a novel dataset, FortisAVQA, constructed in two stages: (1) rephrasing questions in the test split of the public MUSIC-AVQA dataset and (2) introducing distribution shifts across questions. The first stage expands the test space with greater diversity, while the second enables a refined robustness evaluation across rare, frequent, and overall question distributions. Second, we introduce a robust Multimodal Audio-Visual Epistemic Network (MAVEN) that leverages a multifaceted cycle collaborative debiasing strategy to mitigate bias learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on FortisAVQA, with a notable improvement of 7.81\%. Extensive ablation studies on both datasets validate the effectiveness of our debiasing components. Additionally, our evaluation reveals the limited robustness of existing multimodal QA methods. We also verify the plug-and-play capability of our strategy by integrating it with various baseline models across both datasets. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/reml-group/fortisavqa.

- **Summary**: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining serves as a valuable technique for detecting specific antigens or proteins through antibody-mediated visualization. However, the IHC staining process is both time-consuming and costly. To address these limitations, the application of deep learning models for direct translation of cost-effective Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images into IHC stained images has emerged as an efficient solution. Nevertheless, the conversion from H&E to IHC images presents significant challenges, primarily due to alignment discrepancies between image pairs and the inherent diversity in IHC staining style patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Style Distribution Constraint Feature Alignment Network (SCFANet), which incorporates two innovative modules: the Style Distribution Constrainer (SDC) and Feature Alignment Learning (FAL). The SDC ensures consistency between the generated and target images' style distributions while integrating cycle consistency loss to maintain structural consistency. To mitigate the complexity of direct image-to-image translation, the FAL module decomposes the end-to-end translation task into two subtasks: image reconstruction and feature alignment. Furthermore, we ensure pathological consistency between generated and target images by maintaining pathological pattern consistency and Optical Density (OD) uniformity. Extensive experiments conducted on the Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset demonstrate that our SCFANet model outperforms existing methods, achieving precise transformation of H&E-stained images into their IHC-stained counterparts. The proposed approach not only addresses the technical challenges in H&E to IHC image translation but also provides a robust framework for accurate and efficient stain conversion in pathological analysis.

- **Summary**: Learned image compression methods have attracted great research interest and exhibited superior rate-distortion performance to the best classical image compression standards of the present. The entropy model plays a key role in learned image compression, which estimates the probability distribution of the latent representation for further entropy coding. Most existing methods employed hyper-prior and auto-regressive architectures to form their entropy models. However, they only aimed to explore the internal dependencies of latent representation while neglecting the importance of extracting prior from training data. In this work, we propose a novel entropy model named Dictionary-based Cross Attention Entropy model, which introduces a learnable dictionary to summarize the typical structures occurring in the training dataset to enhance the entropy model. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed model strikes a better balance between performance and latency, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from high computational costs due to their massive size and the large number of visual tokens. In this paper, we investigate layer-wise redundancy in MLLMs by introducing a novel metric, Layer Contribution (LC), which quantifies the impact of a layer's transformations on visual and text tokens, respectively. The calculation of LC involves measuring the divergence in model output that results from removing the layer's transformations on the specified tokens. Our pilot experiment reveals that many layers of MLLMs exhibit minimal contribution during the processing of visual tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose ShortV, a training-free method that leverages LC to identify ineffective layers, and freezes visual token updates in these layers. Experiments show that ShortV can freeze visual token in approximately 60\% of the MLLM layers, thereby dramatically reducing computational costs related to updating visual tokens. For example, it achieves a 50\% reduction in FLOPs on LLaVA-NeXT-13B while maintaining superior performance. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/ShortV

- **Summary**: Accurate measurement of eyelid parameters such as Margin Reflex Distances (MRD1, MRD2) and Levator Function (LF) is critical in oculoplastic diagnostics but remains limited by manual, inconsistent methods. This study evaluates deep learning models: SE-ResNet, EfficientNet, and the vision transformer-based DINOv2 for automating these measurements using smartphone-acquired images. We assess performance across frozen and fine-tuned settings, using MSE, MAE, and R2 metrics. DINOv2, pretrained through self-supervised learning, demonstrates superior scalability and robustness, especially under frozen conditions ideal for mobile deployment. Lightweight regressors such as MLP and Deep Ensemble offer high precision with minimal computational overhead. To address class imbalance and improve generalization, we integrate focal loss, orthogonal regularization, and binary encoding strategies. Our results show that DINOv2 combined with these enhancements delivers consistent, accurate predictions across all tasks, making it a strong candidate for real-world, mobile-friendly clinical applications. This work highlights the potential of foundation models in advancing AI-powered ophthalmic care.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-camera systems have become increasingly popular in robotics recently. A critical and initial step in integrating the LiDAR and camera data is the calibration of the LiDAR-camera system. Most existing calibration methods rely on auxiliary target objects, which often involve complex manual operations, whereas targetless methods have yet to achieve practical effectiveness. Recognizing that 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) can reconstruct geometric information from camera image sequences, we propose a calibration method that estimates LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters using geometric constraints. The proposed method begins by reconstructing colorless 2DGS using LiDAR point clouds. Subsequently, we update the colors of the Gaussian splats by minimizing the photometric loss. The extrinsic parameters are optimized during this process. Additionally, we address the limitations of the photometric loss by incorporating the reprojection and triangulation losses, thereby enhancing the calibration robustness and accuracy.

- **Summary**: Generating high-quality pseudo-labels on the cloud is crucial for cloud-edge object detection, especially in dynamic traffic monitoring where data distributions evolve. Existing methods often assume reliable cloud models, neglecting potential errors or struggling with complex distribution shifts. This paper proposes Cloud-Adaptive High-Quality Pseudo-label generation (CA-HQP), addressing these limitations by incorporating a learnable Visual Prompt Generator (VPG) and dual feature alignment into cloud model updates. The VPG enables parameter-efficient adaptation by injecting visual prompts, enhancing flexibility without extensive fine-tuning. CA-HQP mitigates domain discrepancies via two feature alignment techniques: global Domain Query Feature Alignment (DQFA) capturing scene-level shifts, and fine-grained Temporal Instance-Aware Feature Embedding Alignment (TIAFA) addressing instance variations. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic dataset demonstrate that CA-HQP significantly improves pseudo-label quality compared to existing methods, leading to notable performance gains for the edge model and showcasing CA-HQP's adaptation effectiveness. Ablation studies validate each component (DQFA, TIAFA, VPG) and the synergistic effect of combined alignment strategies, highlighting the importance of adaptive cloud updates and domain adaptation for robust object detection in evolving scenarios. CA-HQP provides a promising solution for enhancing cloud-edge object detection systems in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Masked video modeling, such as VideoMAE, is an effective paradigm for video self-supervised learning (SSL). However, they are primarily based on reconstructing pixel-level details on natural videos which have substantial temporal redundancy, limiting their capability for semantic representation and sufficient encoding of motion dynamics. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel SSL approach for video representation learning, dubbed as SMILE, by infusing both spatial and motion semantics. In SMILE, we leverage image-language pretrained models, such as CLIP, to guide the learning process with their high-level spatial semantics. We enhance the representation of motion by introducing synthetic motion patterns in the training data, allowing the model to capture more complex and dynamic content. Furthermore, using SMILE, we establish a new self-supervised video learning paradigm capable of learning strong video representations without requiring any natural video data. We have carried out extensive experiments on 7 datasets with various downstream scenarios. SMILE surpasses current state-of-the-art SSL methods, showcasing its effectiveness in learning more discriminative and generalizable video representations.

- **Summary**: Change detection has essential significance for the region's development, in which pseudo-changes between bitemporal images induced by imaging environmental factors are key challenges. Existing transformation-based methods regard pseudo-changes as a kind of style shift and alleviate it by transforming bitemporal images into the same style using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, their efforts are limited by two drawbacks: 1) Transformed images suffer from distortion that reduces feature discrimination. 2) Alignment hampers the model from learning domain-agnostic representations that degrades performance on scenes with domain shifts from the training data. Therefore, oriented from pseudo-changes caused by style differences, we present a generalizable domain-agnostic difference learning network (DonaNet). For the drawback 1), we argue for local-level statistics as style proxies to assist against domain shifts. For the drawback 2), DonaNet learns domain-agnostic representations by removing domain-specific style of encoded features and highlighting the class characteristics of objects. In the removal, we propose a domain difference removal module to reduce feature variance while preserving discriminative properties and propose its enhanced version to provide possibilities for eliminating more style by decorrelating the correlation between features. In the highlighting, we propose a cross-temporal generalization learning strategy to imitate latent domain shifts, thus enabling the model to extract feature representations more robust to shifts actively. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that DonaNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with a smaller model size and is more robust to domain shift.

- **Summary**: Visual token reduction lowers inference costs caused by extensive image features in large vision-language models (LVLMs). Unlike relevant studies that prune tokens in self-attention-only LVLMs, our work uniquely addresses cross-attention-based models, which achieve superior performance. We identify that the key-value (KV) cache size for image tokens in cross-attention layers significantly exceeds that of text tokens in self-attention layers, posing a major compute bottleneck. To mitigate this issue, we exploit the sparse nature in cross-attention maps to selectively prune redundant visual features. Our Trimmed Llama effectively reduces KV cache demands without requiring additional training. By benefiting from 50%-reduced visual features, our model can reduce inference latency and memory usage while achieving benchmark parity.

- **Summary**: When digitizing historical archives, it is necessary to search for the faces of celebrities and ordinary people, especially in newspapers, link them to the surrounding text, and make them searchable. Existing face detectors on datasets of scanned historical documents fail remarkably -- current detection tools only achieve around $24\%$ mAP at $50:90\%$ IoU. This work compensates for this failure by introducing a new manually annotated domain-specific dataset in the style of the popular Wider Face dataset, containing 2.2k new images from digitized historical newspapers from the $19^{th}$ to $20^{th}$ century, with 11k new bounding-box annotations and associated facial landmarks. This dataset allows existing detectors to be retrained to bring their results closer to the standard in the field of face detection in the wild. We report several experimental results comparing different families of fine-tuned detectors against publicly available pre-trained face detectors and ablation studies of multiple detector sizes with comprehensive detection and landmark prediction performance results.

- **Summary**: Bird's-eye view (BEV) object detection has become important for advanced automotive 3D radar-based perception systems. However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Cross-modal generalization aims to learn a shared discrete representation space from multimodal pairs, enabling knowledge transfer across unannotated modalities. However, achieving a unified representation for all modality pairs requires extensive paired data, which is often impractical. Inspired by the availability of abundant bimodal data (e.g., in ImageBind), we explore a continual learning approach that incrementally maps new modalities into a shared discrete codebook via a mediator modality. We propose the Continual Mixture of Experts Adapter (CMoE-Adapter) to project diverse modalities into a unified space while preserving prior knowledge. To align semantics across stages, we introduce a Pseudo-Modality Replay (PMR) mechanism with a dynamically expanding codebook, enabling the model to adaptively incorporate new modalities using learned ones as guidance. Extensive experiments on image-text, audio-text, video-text, and speech-text show that our method achieves strong performance on various cross-modal generalization tasks.

- **Summary**: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses neural networks by learning a small network (student) via transferring knowledge from a pre-trained large network (teacher). Many endeavours have been devoted to the image domain, while few works focus on video analysis which desires training much larger model making it be hardly deployed in resource-limited devices. However, traditional methods neglect two important problems, i.e., 1) Since the capacity gap between the teacher and the student exists, some knowledge w.r.t. difficult-to-transfer samples cannot be correctly transferred, or even badly affects the final performance of student, and 2) As training progresses, difficult-to-transfer samples may become easier to learn, and vice versa. To alleviate the two problems, we propose a Sample-level Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (SAKD) framework for action recognition. In particular, it mainly consists of the sample distillation difficulty evaluation module and the sample adaptive distillation module. The former applies the temporal interruption to frames, i.e., randomly dropout or shuffle the frames during training, which increases the learning difficulty of samples during distillation, so as to better discriminate their distillation difficulty. The latter module adaptively adjusts distillation ratio at sample level, such that KD loss dominates the training with easy-to-transfer samples while vanilla loss dominates that with difficult-to-transfer samples. More importantly, we only select those samples with both low distillation difficulty and high diversity to train the student model for reducing computational cost. Experimental results on two video benchmarks and one image benchmark demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method by striking a good balance between performance and efficiency.

- **Summary**: In image anomaly detection, significant advancements have been made using un- and self-supervised methods with datasets containing only normal samples. However, these approaches often struggle with fine-grained anomalies. This paper introduces \textbf{GRAD}: Bi-\textbf{G}rid \textbf{R}econstruction for Image \textbf{A}nomaly \textbf{D}etection, which employs two continuous grids to enhance anomaly detection from both normal and abnormal perspectives. In this work: 1) Grids as feature repositories that improve generalization and mitigate the Identical Shortcut (IS) issue; 2) An abnormal feature grid that refines normal feature boundaries, boosting detection of fine-grained defects; 3) The Feature Block Paste (FBP) module, which synthesizes various anomalies at the feature level for quick abnormal grid deployment. GRAD's robust representation capabilities also allow it to handle multiple classes with a single model. Evaluations on datasets like MVTecAD, VisA, and GoodsAD show significant performance improvements in fine-grained anomaly detection. GRAD excels in overall accuracy and in discerning subtle differences, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce Coca-Splat, a novel approach to addressing the challenges of sparse view pose-free scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis (NVS) by jointly optimizing camera parameters with 3D Gaussians. Inspired by deformable DEtection TRansformer, we design separate queries for 3D Gaussians and camera parameters and update them layer by layer through deformable Transformer layers, enabling joint optimization in a single network. This design demonstrates better performance because to accurately render views that closely approximate ground-truth images relies on precise estimation of both 3D Gaussians and camera parameters. In such a design, the centers of 3D Gaussians are projected onto each view by camera parameters to get projected points, which are regarded as 2D reference points in deformable cross-attention. With camera-aware multi-view deformable cross-attention (CaMDFA), 3D Gaussians and camera parameters are intrinsically connected by sharing the 2D reference points. Additionally, 2D reference point determined rays (RayRef) defined from camera centers to the reference points assist in modeling relationship between 3D Gaussians and camera parameters through RQ-decomposition on an overdetermined system of equations derived from the rays, enhancing the relationship between 3D Gaussians and camera parameters. Extensive evaluation shows that our approach outperforms previous methods, both pose-required and pose-free, on RealEstate10K and ACID within the same pose-free setting.

- **Summary**: Existing LVLM-based reasoning segmentation methods often suffer from imprecise segmentation results and hallucinations in their text responses. This paper introduces POPEN, a novel framework designed to address these issues and achieve improved results. POPEN includes a preference-based optimization method to finetune the LVLM, aligning it more closely with human preferences and thereby generating better text responses and segmentation results. Additionally, POPEN introduces a preference-based ensemble method for inference, which integrates multiple outputs from the LVLM using a preference-score-based attention mechanism for refinement. To better adapt to the segmentation task, we incorporate several task-specific designs in our POPEN framework, including a new approach for collecting segmentation preference data with a curriculum learning mechanism, and a novel preference optimization loss to refine the segmentation capability of the LVLM. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in reasoning segmentation, exhibiting minimal hallucination in text responses and the highest segmentation accuracy compared to previous advanced methods like LISA and PixelLM.

- **Summary**: Temporal action detection aims to locate and classify actions in untrimmed videos. While recent works focus on designing powerful feature processors for pre-trained representations, they often overlook the inherent noise and redundancy within these features. Large-scale pre-trained video encoders tend to introduce background clutter and irrelevant semantics, leading to context confusion and imprecise boundaries. To address this, we propose a frequency-aware decoupling network that improves action discriminability by filtering out noisy semantics captured by pre-trained models. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive temporal decoupling scheme that suppresses irrelevant information while preserving fine-grained atomic action details, yielding more task-specific representations. In addition, we enhance inter-frame modeling by capturing temporal variations to better distinguish actions from background redundancy. Furthermore, we present a long-short-term category-aware relation network that jointly models local transitions and long-range dependencies, improving localization precision. The refined atomic features and frequency-guided dynamics are fed into a standard detection head to produce accurate action predictions. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14, HACS, and ActivityNet-1.3 show that our method, powered by InternVideo2-6B features, achieves state-of-the-art performance on temporal action detection benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant progress in open-world Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, integrating visual information increases the number of processed tokens, leading to higher GPU memory usage and computational overhead. Images often contain more redundant information than text, and not all visual details are pertinent to specific questions. To address these challenges, we propose QG-VTC, a novel question-guided visual token compression method for MLLM-based VQA tasks. QG-VTC employs a pretrained text encoder and a learnable feed-forward layer to embed user questions into the vision encoder's feature space then computes correlation scores between the question embeddings and visual tokens. By selecting the most relevant tokens and softly compressing others, QG-VTC ensures fine-tuned relevance to user needs. Additionally, a progressive strategy applies this compression across different vision encoder layers, gradually reducing token numbers. This approach maximizes retention of question-relevant information while discarding irrelevant details. Experimental results show that our method achieves performance on par with uncompressed models using just 1/8 of the visual tokens. The code and model will be publicly available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce Monocular and Generalizable Gaussian Talking Head Animation (MGGTalk), which requires monocular datasets and generalizes to unseen identities without personalized re-training. Compared with previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that requires elusive multi-view datasets or tedious personalized learning/inference, MGGtalk enables more practical and broader applications. However, in the absence of multi-view and personalized training data, the incompleteness of geometric and appearance information poses a significant challenge. To address these challenges, MGGTalk explores depth information to enhance geometric and facial symmetry characteristics to supplement both geometric and appearance features. Initially, based on the pixel-wise geometric information obtained from depth estimation, we incorporate symmetry operations and point cloud filtering techniques to ensure a complete and precise position parameter for 3DGS. Subsequently, we adopt a two-stage strategy with symmetric priors for predicting the remaining 3DGS parameters. We begin by predicting Gaussian parameters for the visible facial regions of the source image. These parameters are subsequently utilized to improve the prediction of Gaussian parameters for the non-visible regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGGTalk surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance across various metrics.

- **Summary**: Vision-language (VL) learning requires extensive visual perception capabilities, such as fine-grained object recognition and spatial perception. Recent works typically rely on training huge models on massive datasets to develop these capabilities. As a more efficient alternative, this paper proposes a new framework that Transfers the knowledge from a hub of Vision Experts (ToVE) for efficient VL learning, leveraging pre-trained vision expert models to promote visual perception capability. Specifically, building on a frozen CLIP encoder that provides vision tokens for image-conditioned language generation, ToVE introduces a hub of multiple vision experts and a token-aware gating network that dynamically routes expert knowledge to vision tokens. In the transfer phase, we propose a "residual knowledge transfer" strategy, which not only preserves the generalizability of the vision tokens but also allows detachment of low-contributing experts to improve inference efficiency. Further, we explore to merge these expert knowledge to a single CLIP encoder, creating a knowledge-merged CLIP that produces more informative vision tokens without expert inference during deployment. Experiment results across various VL tasks demonstrate that the proposed ToVE achieves competitive performance with two orders of magnitude fewer training data.

- **Summary**: We axiomatically derive a family of wavelets for an orientation score, lifting from position space $\mathbb{R}^2$ to position and orientation space $\mathbb{R}^2\times S^1$, with fast reconstruction property, that minimise position-orientation uncertainty. We subsequently show that these minimum uncertainty states are well-approximated by cake wavelets: for standard parameters, the uncertainty gap of cake wavelets is less than 1.1, and in the limit, we prove the uncertainty gap tends to the minimum of 1. Next, we complete a previous theoretical argument that one does not have to train the lifting layer in (PDE-)G-CNNs, but can instead use cake wavelets. Finally, we show experimentally that in this way we can reduce the network complexity and improve the interpretability of (PDE-)G-CNNs, with only a slight impact on the model's performance.

- **Summary**: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) present a promising computing paradigm for neuromorphic processing of event-based sensor data. The resonate-and-fire (RF) neuron, in particular, appeals through its biological plausibility, complex dynamics, yet computational simplicity. Despite theoretically predicted benefits, challenges in parameter initialization and efficient learning inhibited the implementation of RF networks, constraining their use to a single layer. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by deriving the RF neuron as a structured state space model (SSM) from the HiPPO framework. We introduce S5-RF, a new SSM layer comprised of RF neurons based on the S5 model, that features a generic initialization scheme and fast training within a deep architecture. S5-RF scales for the first time a RF network to a deep SNN with up to four layers and achieves with 78.8% a new state-of-the-art result for recurrent SNNs on the Spiking Speech Commands dataset in under three hours of training time. Moreover, compared to the reference SNNs that solve our benchmarking tasks, it achieves similar performance with much fewer spiking operations.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel knowledge-Base (KB) assisted semantic communication framework for image transmission. At the receiver, a Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) based vector database is constructed by extracting semantic embeddings from images using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model. During transmission, the transmitter first extracts a 512-dimensional semantic feature using the CLIP model, then compresses it with a lightweight neural network for transmission. After receiving the signal, the receiver reconstructs the feature back to 512 dimensions and performs similarity matching from the KB to retrieve the most semantically similar image. Semantic transmission success is determined by category consistency between the transmitted and retrieved images, rather than traditional metrics like Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). The proposed system prioritizes semantic accuracy, offering a new evaluation paradigm for semantic-aware communication systems. Experimental validation on CIFAR100 demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework in achieving semantic image transmission.

- **Summary**: Promoting the connectivity of curvilinear structures, such as neuronal processes in biomedical scans and blood vessels in CT images, remains a key challenge in semantic segmentation. Traditional pixel-wise loss functions, including cross-entropy and Dice losses, often fail to capture high-level topological connectivity, resulting in topological mistakes in graphs obtained from prediction maps. In this paper, we propose CAPE (Connectivity-Aware Path Enforcement), a novel loss function designed to enforce connectivity in graphs obtained from segmentation maps by optimizing a graph connectivity metric. CAPE uses the graph representation of the ground truth to select node pairs and determine their corresponding paths within the predicted segmentation through a shortest-path algorithm. Using this, we penalize both disconnections and false positive connections, effectively promoting the model to preserve topological correctness. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets, including neuron and blood vessel tracing demonstrate that CAPE significantly improves topology-aware metrics and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Building interpretation from remote sensing imagery primarily involves two fundamental tasks: building extraction and change detection. However, most existing methods address these tasks independently, overlooking their inherent correlation and failing to exploit shared feature representations for mutual enhancement. Furthermore, the diverse spectral,spatial, and scale characteristics of buildings pose additional challenges in jointly modeling spatial-spectral multi-scale features and effectively balancing precision and recall. The limited synergy between spatial and spectral representations often results in reduced detection accuracy and incomplete change localization.To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatial-Spectral Feature Cooperative Dual-Task Network (MSSFC-Net) for joint building extraction and change detection in remote sensing images. The framework integrates both tasks within a unified architecture, leveraging their complementary nature to simultaneously extract building and change features. Specifically,a Dual-branch Multi-scale Feature Extraction module (DMFE) with Spatial-Spectral Feature Collaboration (SSFC) is designed to enhance multi-scale representation learning, effectively capturing shallow texture details and deep semantic information, thus improving building extraction performance. For temporal feature aggregation, we introduce a Multi-scale Differential Fusion Module (MDFM) that explicitly models the interaction between differential and dual-temporal features. This module refines the network's capability to detect large-area changes and subtle structural variations in buildings. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSSFC-Net achieves superior performance in both building extraction and change detection tasks, effectively improving detection accuracy while maintaining completeness.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing and decomposing dynamic urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, urban planning, and scene editing. However, existing methods fail to perform instance-aware decomposition without manual annotations, which is crucial for instance-level scene editing.We propose UnIRe, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based approach that decomposes a scene into a static background and individual dynamic instances using only RGB images and LiDAR point clouds. At its core, we introduce 4D superpoints, a novel representation that clusters multi-frame LiDAR points in 4D space, enabling unsupervised instance separation based on spatiotemporal correlations. These 4D superpoints serve as the foundation for our decomposed 4D initialization, i.e., providing spatial and temporal initialization to train a dynamic 3DGS for arbitrary dynamic classes without requiring bounding boxes or object templates.Furthermore, we introduce a smoothness regularization strategy in both 2D and 3D space, further improving the temporal stability.Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods in decomposed dynamic scene reconstruction while enabling accurate and flexible instance-level editing, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Multi-task neural architecture search (NAS) enables transferring architectural knowledge among different tasks. However, ranking disorder between the source task and the target task degrades the architecture performance on the downstream task. We propose KTNAS, an evolutionary cross-task NAS algorithm, to enhance transfer efficiency. Our data-agnostic method converts neural architectures into graphs and uses architecture embedding vectors for the subsequent architecture performance prediction. The concept of transfer rank, an instance-based classifier, is introduced into KTNAS to address the performance degradation issue. We verify the search efficiency on NASBench-201 and transferability to various vision tasks on Micro TransNAS-Bench-101. The scalability of our method is demonstrated on DARTs search space including CIFAR-10/100, MNIST/Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST. Experimental results show that KTNAS outperforms peer multi-task NAS algorithms in search efficiency and downstream task performance. Ablation studies demonstrate the vital importance of transfer rank for transfer performance.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has gained considerable attentions in the field of novel view synthesis due to its fast performance while yielding the excellent image quality. However, 3DGS in sparse-view settings (e.g., three-view inputs) often faces with the problem of overfitting to training views, which significantly drops the visual quality of novel view images. Many existing approaches have tackled this issue by using strong priors, such as 2D generative contextual information and external depth signals. In contrast, this paper introduces a prior-free method, so-called DropGaussian, with simple changes in 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we randomly remove Gaussians during the training process in a similar way of dropout, which allows non-excluded Gaussians to have larger gradients while improving their visibility. This makes the remaining Gaussians to contribute more to the optimization process for rendering with sparse input views. Such simple operation effectively alleviates the overfitting problem and enhances the quality of novel view synthesis. By simply applying DropGaussian to the original 3DGS framework, we can achieve the competitive performance with existing prior-based 3DGS methods in sparse-view settings of benchmark datasets without any additional complexity. The code and model are publicly available at: https://github.com/DCVL-3D/DropGaussian release.

- **Summary**: This study focuses on Embodied Complex-Question Answering task, which means the embodied robot need to understand human questions with intricate structures and abstract semantics. The core of this task lies in making appropriate plans based on the perception of the visual environment. Existing methods often generate plans in a once-for-all manner, i.e., one-step planning. Such approach rely on large models, without sufficient understanding of the environment. Considering multi-step planning, the framework for formulating plans in a sequential manner is proposed in this paper. To ensure the ability of our framework to tackle complex questions, we create a structured semantic space, where hierarchical visual perception and chain expression of the question essence can achieve iterative interaction. This space makes sequential task planning possible. Within the framework, we first parse human natural language based on a visual hierarchical scene graph, which can clarify the intention of the question. Then, we incorporate external rules to make a plan for current step, weakening the reliance on large models. Every plan is generated based on feedback from visual perception, with multiple rounds of interaction until an answer is obtained. This approach enables continuous feedback and adjustment, allowing the robot to optimize its action strategy. To test our framework, we contribute a new dataset with more complex questions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs excellently and stably on complex tasks. And also, the feasibility of our approach in real-world scenarios has been established, indicating its practical applicability.

- **Summary**: Cell instance segmentation is a fundamental task in digital pathology with broad clinical applications. Recently, vision foundation models, which are predominantly based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), have achieved remarkable success in pathology image analysis. However, their improvements in cell instance segmentation remain limited. A key challenge arises from the tokenization process in ViTs, which substantially reduces the spatial resolution of input images, leading to suboptimal segmentation quality, especially for small and densely packed cells. To address this problem, we propose CellVTA (Cell Vision Transformer with Adapter), a novel method that improves the performance of vision foundation models for cell instance segmentation by incorporating a CNN-based adapter module. This adapter extracts high-resolution spatial information from input images and injects it into the ViT through a cross-attention mechanism. Our method preserves the core architecture of ViT, ensuring seamless integration with pretrained foundation models. Extensive experiments show that CellVTA achieves 0.538 mPQ on the CoNIC dataset and 0.506 mPQ on the PanNuke dataset, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art cell segmentation methods. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our approach over other fine-tuning strategies, including decoder-only fine-tuning and full fine-tuning. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/JieZheng-ShanghaiTech/CellVTA.

- **Summary**: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving images matching a reference image augmented with a text, where the text describes changes to the reference image in natural language. Traditionally, models designed for CIR have relied on triplet data containing a reference image, reformulation text, and a target image. However, curating such triplet data often necessitates human intervention, leading to prohibitive costs. This challenge has hindered the scalability of CIR model training even with the availability of abundant unlabeled data. With the recent advances in foundational models, we advocate a shift in the CIR training paradigm where human annotations can be efficiently replaced by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we demonstrate the capability of large captioning and language models in efficiently generating data for CIR only relying on unannotated image collections. Additionally, we introduce an embedding reformulation architecture that effectively combines image and text modalities. Our model, named InstructCIR, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot composed image retrieval on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by increasing the amount of generated data, our zero-shot model gets closer to the performance of supervised baselines.

- **Summary**: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a vital molecular imaging tool widely used in medical diagnosis and treatment evaluation. Traditional PET systems typically rely on complete detector rings to achieve full angular coverage for uniform and statistically robust sampling of coincidence events. However, incomplete-ring PET scanners have emerged in various scenarios due to hardware failures, cost constraints, or specific clinical needs. In such cases, conventional reconstruction algorithms often suffer from performance degradation due to reduced data completeness and geometric inconsistencies. This thesis proposes a coarse-to-fine reconstruction framework for incomplete-ring PET scanners. The framework first employs an Attention U-Net model to recover complete sinograms from incomplete ones, then uses the OSEM algorithm for preliminary reconstruction, and finally applies a two-stage architecture comprising a Coarse Prediction Module (CPM) and an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) for fine reconstruction. Our approach utilizes neighboring axial slices and spectral transform features as auxiliary guidance at the input level to ensure spatial and frequency domain consistency, and integrates a contrastive diffusion strategy at the output level to improve correspondence between low-quality PET inputs and refined PET outputs. Experimental results on public and in-house brain PET datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in metrics such as PSNR (35.6421 dB) and SSIM (0.9588), successfully preserving key anatomical structures and tracer distribution features, thus providing an effective solution for incomplete-ring PET imaging.

- **Summary**: In Scene Graphs Generation (SGG) one extracts structured representation from visual inputs in the form of objects nodes and predicates connecting them. This facilitates image-based understanding and reasoning for various downstream tasks. Although fully supervised SGG approaches showed steady performance improvements, they suffer from a severe training bias. This is caused by the availability of only small subsets of curated data and exhibits long-tail predicate distribution issues with a lack of predicate diversity adversely affecting downstream tasks. To overcome this, we introduce PRISM-0, a framework for zero-shot open-vocabulary SGG that bootstraps foundation models in a bottom-up approach to capture the whole spectrum of diverse, open-vocabulary predicate prediction. Detected object pairs are filtered and passed to a Vision Language Model (VLM) that generates descriptive captions. These are used to prompt an LLM to generate fine-andcoarse-grained predicates for the pair. The predicates are then validated using a VQA model to provide a final SGG. With the modular and dataset-independent PRISM-0, we can enrich existing SG datasets such as Visual Genome (VG). Experiments illustrate that PRIMS-0 generates semantically meaningful graphs that improve downstream tasks such as Image Captioning and Sentence-to-Graph Retrieval with a performance on par to the best fully supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot 4D segmentation and recognition of arbitrary objects in Lidar is crucial for embodied navigation, with applications ranging from streaming perception to semantic mapping and localization. However, the primary challenge in advancing research and developing generalized, versatile methods for spatio-temporal scene understanding in Lidar lies in the scarcity of datasets that provide the necessary diversity and scale of annotations.To overcome these challenges, we propose SAL-4D (Segment Anything in Lidar--4D), a method that utilizes multi-modal robotic sensor setups as a bridge to distill recent developments in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) in conjunction with off-the-shelf Vision-Language foundation models to Lidar. We utilize VOS models to pseudo-label tracklets in short video sequences, annotate these tracklets with sequence-level CLIP tokens, and lift them to the 4D Lidar space using calibrated multi-modal sensory setups to distill them to our SAL-4D model. Due to temporal consistent predictions, we outperform prior art in 3D Zero-Shot Lidar Panoptic Segmentation (LPS) over $5$ PQ, and unlock Zero-Shot 4D-LPS.

- **Summary**: Attribute skew in federated learning leads local models to focus on learning non-causal associations, guiding them towards inconsistent optimization directions, which inevitably results in performance degradation and unstable convergence. Existing methods typically leverage data augmentation to enhance sample diversity or employ knowledge distillation to learn invariant representations. However, the instability in the quality of generated data and the lack of domain information limit their performance on unseen samples. To address these issues, this paper presents a global intervention and distillation method, termed FedGID, which utilizes diverse attribute features for backdoor adjustment to break the spurious association between background and label. It includes two main modules, where the global intervention module adaptively decouples objects and backgrounds in images, injects background information into random samples to intervene in the sample distribution, which links backgrounds to all categories to prevent the model from treating background-label associations as causal. The global distillation module leverages a unified knowledge base to guide the representation learning of client models, preventing local models from overfitting to client-specific attributes. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that FedGID enhances the model's ability to focus on the main subjects in unseen data and outperforms existing methods in collaborative modeling.

- **Summary**: The challenge of detecting violent incidents in urban surveillance systems is compounded by the voluminous and diverse nature of video data. This paper presents a targeted approach using Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) to address these issues, specifically employing the Federated Learning with Personalization Layers method within the Flower framework. Our methodology adapts learning models to the unique data characteristics of each surveillance node, effectively managing the heterogeneous and non-IID nature of surveillance video data. Through rigorous experiments conducted on balanced and imbalanced datasets, our PFL models demonstrated enhanced accuracy and efficiency, achieving up to 99.3% accuracy. This study underscores the potential of PFL to significantly improve the scalability and effectiveness of surveillance systems, offering a robust, privacy-preserving solution for violence detection in complex urban environments.

- **Summary**: Radar is an important sensor for autonomous driving (AD) systems due to its robustness to adverse weather and different lighting conditions. Novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) has recently received considerable attention in AD due to its potential to enable efficient testing and validation but remains unexplored for radar point clouds. In this paper, we present NeuRadar, a NeRF-based model that jointly generates radar point clouds, camera images, and lidar point clouds. We explore set-based object detection methods such as DETR, and propose an encoder-based solution grounded in the NeRF geometry for improved generalizability. We propose both a deterministic and a probabilistic point cloud representation to accurately model the radar behavior, with the latter being able to capture radar's stochastic behavior. We achieve realistic reconstruction results for two automotive datasets, establishing a baseline for NeRF-based radar point cloud simulation models. In addition, we release radar data for ZOD's Sequences and Drives to enable further research in this field. To encourage further development of radar NeRFs, we release the source code for NeuRadar.

- **Summary**: Despite the promising performance achieved by current semi-supervised models in segmenting individual medical targets, many of these models suffer a notable decrease in performance when tasked with the simultaneous segmentation of multiple targets. A vital factor could be attributed to the imbalanced scales among different targets: during simultaneously segmenting multiple targets, large targets dominate the loss, leading to small targets being misclassified as larger ones. To this end, we propose a novel method, which consists of a Collaborative Generalist and several Specialists, termed CGS. It is centered around the idea of employing a specialist for each target class, thus avoiding the dominance of larger targets. The generalist performs conventional multi-target segmentation, while each specialist is dedicated to distinguishing a specific target class from the remaining target classes and the background. Based on a theoretical insight, we demonstrate that CGS can achieve a more balanced training. Moreover, we develop cross-consistency losses to foster collaborative learning between the generalist and the specialists. Lastly, regarding their intrinsic relation that the target class of any specialized head should belong to the remaining classes of the other heads, we introduce an inter-head error detection module to further enhance the quality of pseudo-labels. Experimental results on three popular benchmarks showcase its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Normal integration reconstructs 3D surfaces from normal maps obtained e.g. by photometric stereo. These normal maps capture surface details down to the pixel level but require large computational resources for integration at high resolutions. In this work, we replace the dense pixel grid with a sparse anisotropic triangle mesh prior to normal integration. We adapt the triangle mesh to the local geometry in the case of complex surface structures and remove oversampling from flat featureless regions. For high-resolution images, the resulting compression reduces normal integration runtimes from hours to minutes while maintaining high surface accuracy. Our main contribution is the derivation of the well-known quadric error measure from mesh decimation for screen space applications and its combination with optimal Delaunay triangulation.

- **Summary**: Recently Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) has garnered attention and can transfer knowledge from a teacher neural network to a student neural network without requiring any access to training data. Although diffusion models are adept at synthesizing high-fidelity photorealistic images across various domains, existing methods cannot be easiliy implemented to DFKD. To bridge that gap, this paper proposes a novel approach based on diffusion models, DiffDFKD. Specifically, DiffDFKD involves targeted optimizations in two key areas. Firstly, DiffDFKD utilizes valuable information from teacher models to guide the pre-trained diffusion models' data synthesis, generating datasets that mirror the training data distribution and effectively bridge domain gaps. Secondly, to reduce computational burdens, DiffDFKD introduces Latent CutMix Augmentation, an efficient technique, to enhance the diversity of diffusion model-generated images for DFKD while preserving key attributes for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of DiffDFKD, yielding state-of-the-art results exceeding existing DFKD approaches. We release our code at https://github.com/xhqi0109/DiffDFKD.

- **Summary**: Video multi-target segmentation remains a major challenge in long sequences, mainly due to the inherent limitations of existing architectures in capturing global temporal dependencies. We introduce WISE-TTT, a synergistic architecture integrating Test-Time Training (TTT) mechanisms with the Transformer architecture through co-design. The TTT layer systematically compresses historical temporal data to generate hidden states containing worldwide information(Lossless memory to maintain long contextual integrity), while achieving multi-stage contextual aggregation through splicing. Crucially, our framework provides the first empirical validation that implementing worldwide information across multiple network layers is essential for optimal dependency utilization.Ablation studies show TTT modules at high-level features boost global modeling. This translates to 3.1% accuracy improvement(J&F metric) on Davis2017 long-term benchmarks -- the first proof of hierarchical context superiority in video segmentation. We provide the first systematic evidence that worldwide information critically impacts segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Increasing attention has been placed on improving the reasoning capacities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). As the cornerstone for AI agents that function in the physical realm, video-based visual-spatial intelligence (VSI) emerges as one of the most pivotal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This work conducts a first, in-depth study on improving the visual-spatial reasoning of MLLMs via R1-Zero-like training. Technically, we first identify that the visual-spatial reasoning capacities of small- to medium-sized Qwen2-VL models cannot be activated via Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. We then incorporate GRPO training for improved visual-spatial reasoning, using the carefully curated VSI-100k dataset, following DeepSeek-R1-Zero. During the investigation, we identify the necessity to keep the KL penalty (even with a small value) in GRPO. With just 120 GPU hours, our vsGRPO-2B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-2B, can outperform the base model by 12.1% and surpass GPT-4o. Moreover, our vsGRPO-7B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-7B, achieves performance comparable to that of the best open-source model LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B. Additionally, we compare vsGRPO to supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization baselines and observe strong performance superiority. The code and dataset will be available soon.

- **Summary**: Hardware limitations and satellite launch costs make direct acquisition of high temporal-spatial resolution remote sensing imagery challenging. Remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion (STF) technology addresses this problem by merging high temporal but low spatial resolution imagery with high spatial but low temporal resolution imagery to efficiently generate high spatiotemporal resolution satellite images. STF provides unprecedented observational capabilities for land surface change monitoring, agricultural management, and environmental research. Deep learning (DL) methods have revolutionized the remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion field over the past decade through powerful automatic feature extraction and nonlinear modeling capabilities, significantly outperforming traditional methods in handling complex spatiotemporal data. Despite the rapid development of DL-based remote sensing STF, the community lacks a systematic review of this quickly evolving field. This paper comprehensively reviews DL developments in remote sensing STF over the last decade, analyzing key research trends, method classifications, commonly used datasets, and evaluation metrics. It discusses major challenges in existing research and identifies promising future research directions as references for researchers in this field to inspire new ideas.

- **Summary**: Computer use agents automate digital tasks by directly interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on computers and mobile devices, offering significant potential to enhance human productivity by completing an open-ended space of user queries. However, current agents face significant challenges: imprecise grounding of GUI elements, difficulties with long-horizon task planning, and performance bottlenecks from relying on single generalist models for diverse cognitive tasks. To this end, we introduce Agent S2, a novel compositional framework that delegates cognitive responsibilities across various generalist and specialist models. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Grounding technique to achieve precise GUI localization and introduce Proactive Hierarchical Planning, dynamically refining action plans at multiple temporal scales in response to evolving observations. Evaluations demonstrate that Agent S2 establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three prominent computer use benchmarks. Specifically, Agent S2 achieves 18.9% and 32.7% relative improvements over leading baseline agents such as Claude Computer Use and UI-TARS on the OSWorld 15-step and 50-step evaluation. Moreover, Agent S2 generalizes effectively to other operating systems and applications, surpassing previous best methods by 52.8% on WindowsAgentArena and by 16.52% on AndroidWorld relatively.

- **Summary**: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges due to limited annotation data, particularly in three-dimensional carotid artery segmentation tasks, where existing datasets exhibit spatially discontinuous slice annotations with only a small portion of expert-labeled slices in complete 3D volumetric data. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage segmentation framework. First, we construct continuous vessel centerlines by interpolating between annotated slice centroids and propagate labels along these centerlines to generate interpolated annotations for unlabeled slices. The slices with expert annotations are used for fine-tuning SAM-Med2D, while the interpolated labels on unlabeled slices serve as prompts to guide segmentation during inference. In the second stage, we propose a novel Dense Bidirectional Feature Fusion UNet (DBF-UNet). This lightweight architecture achieves precise segmentation of complete 3D vascular structures. The network incorporates bidirectional feature fusion in the encoder and integrates multi-scale feature aggregation with dense connectivity for effective feature reuse. Experimental validation on public datasets demonstrates that our proposed method effectively addresses the sparse annotation challenge in carotid artery segmentation while achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.

- **Summary**: We present the challenging task of automatically creating a high-level Wikipedia-style article that aggregates information from multiple diverse videos about real-world events, such as natural disasters or political elections. Videos are intuitive sources for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but most contemporary RAG workflows focus heavily on text and existing methods for video-based summarization focus on low-level scene understanding rather than high-level event semantics. To close this gap, we introduce WikiVideo, a benchmark consisting of expert-written articles and densely annotated videos that provide evidence for articles' claims, facilitating the integration of video into RAG pipelines and enabling the creation of in-depth content that is grounded in multimodal sources. We further propose Collaborative Article Generation (CAG), a novel interactive method for article creation from multiple videos. CAG leverages an iterative interaction between an r1-style reasoning model and a VideoLLM to draw higher level inferences about the target event than is possible with VideoLLMs alone, which fixate on low-level visual features. We benchmark state-of-the-art VideoLLMs and CAG in both oracle retrieval and RAG settings and find that CAG consistently outperforms alternative methods, while suggesting intriguing avenues for future work.

- **Summary**: Introduction: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a serious brain infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, characterized by inflammation of the meninges covering the brain and spinal cord. Diagnosis often requires invasive lumbar puncture (LP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Objectives: This study aims to classify TBM patients using T1-weighted (T1w) non-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. We hypothesize that specific brain regions, such as the interpeduncular cisterns, bone, and corpus callosum, contain visual markers that can non-invasively distinguish TBM patients from healthy controls. We propose a novel Pixel-array Graphs Classifier (PAG-Classifier) that leverages spatial relationships between neighbouring 3D pixels in a graph-based framework to extract significant features through eigen decomposition. These features are then used to train machine learning classifiers for effective patient classification. We validate our approach using a radiomics-based methodology, classifying TBM patients based on relevant radiomics features. Results: We utilized an internal dataset consisting of 52 scans, 32 from confirmed TBM patients based on mycobacteria detection in CSF, and 20 from healthy individuals. We achieved a 5-fold cross-validated average F1 score of 85.71% for cistern regions with our PAG-Classifier and 92.85% with the radiomics features classifier, surpassing current state-of-the-art benchmarks by 15% and 22%, respectively. However, bone and corpus callosum regions showed poor classification effectiveness, with average F1 scores below 50%. Conclusion: Our study suggests that algorithms like the PAG-Classifier serve as effective tools for non-invasive TBM analysis, particularly by targeting the interpeduncular cistern. Findings indicate that the bone and corpus callosum regions lack distinctive patterns for differentiation.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that poses significant diagnostic challenges due to its complex etiology. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown promise in modeling brain connectivity for AD diagnosis, yet their reliance on linear transformations limits their ability to capture intricate nonlinear patterns in neuroimaging data. To address this, we propose GCN-KAN, a novel single-modal framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) into GCNs to enhance both diagnostic accuracy and interpretability. Leveraging structural MRI data, our model employs learnable spline-based transformations to better represent brain region interactions. Evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, GCN-KAN outperforms traditional GCNs by 4-8% in classification accuracy while providing interpretable insights into key brain regions associated with AD. This approach offers a robust and explainable tool for early AD diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have become a popular 3D reconstruction approach in recent years. While they produce high-quality results, they also demand lengthy training times, often spanning days. This paper studies neural pruning as a strategy to address these concerns. We compare pruning approaches, including uniform sampling, importance-based methods, and coreset-based techniques, to reduce the model size and speed up training. Our findings show that coreset-driven pruning can achieve a 50% reduction in model size and a 35% speedup in training, with only a slight decrease in accuracy. These results suggest that pruning can be an effective method for improving the efficiency of NeRF models in resource-limited settings.

- **Summary**: The scarcity of accessible, compliant, and ethically sourced data presents a considerable challenge to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in sensitive fields like healthcare, finance, and biomedical research. Furthermore, access to unrestricted public datasets is increasingly constrained due to rising concerns over privacy, copyright, and competition. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative, and diffusion models -- a cutting-edge generative AI technology -- provide an effective solution for generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data. In this paper, we introduce a novel federated learning framework for training diffusion models on decentralized private datasets. Our framework leverages personalization and the inherent noise in the forward diffusion process to produce high-quality samples while ensuring robust differential privacy guarantees. Our experiments show that our framework outperforms non-collaborative training methods, particularly in settings with high data heterogeneity, and effectively reduces biases and imbalances in synthetic data, resulting in fairer downstream models.

- **Summary**: Multimodal retrieval systems are becoming increasingly vital for cutting-edge AI technologies, such as embodied AI and AI-driven digital content industries. However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications.

- **Summary**: We introduce the WorldScore benchmark, the first unified benchmark for world generation. We decompose world generation into a sequence of next-scene generation tasks with explicit camera trajectory-based layout specifications, enabling unified evaluation of diverse approaches from 3D and 4D scene generation to video generation models. The WorldScore benchmark encompasses a curated dataset of 3,000 test examples that span diverse worlds: static and dynamic, indoor and outdoor, photorealistic and stylized. The WorldScore metrics evaluate generated worlds through three key aspects: controllability, quality, and dynamics. Through extensive evaluation of 19 representative models, including both open-source and closed-source ones, we reveal key insights and challenges for each category of models. Our dataset, evaluation code, and leaderboard can be found at https://haoyi-duan.github.io/WorldScore/

- **Summary**: We present SuperDec, an approach for creating compact 3D scene representations via decomposition into superquadric primitives. While most recent works leverage geometric primitives to obtain photorealistic 3D scene representations, we propose to leverage them to obtain a compact yet expressive representation. We propose to solve the problem locally on individual objects and leverage the capabilities of instance segmentation methods to scale our solution to full 3D scenes. In doing that, we design a new architecture which efficiently decompose point clouds of arbitrary objects in a compact set of superquadrics. We train our architecture on ShapeNet and we prove its generalization capabilities on object instances extracted from the ScanNet++ dataset as well as on full Replica scenes. Finally, we show how a compact representation based on superquadrics can be useful for a diverse range of downstream applications, including robotic tasks and controllable visual content generation and editing.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces TurboFill, a fast image inpainting model that enhances a few-step text-to-image diffusion model with an inpainting adapter for high-quality and efficient inpainting. While standard diffusion models generate high-quality results, they incur high computational costs. We overcome this by training an inpainting adapter on a few-step distilled text-to-image model, DMD2, using a novel 3-step adversarial training scheme to ensure realistic, structurally consistent, and visually harmonious inpainted regions. To evaluate TurboFill, we propose two benchmarks: DilationBench, which tests performance across mask sizes, and HumanBench, based on human feedback for complex prompts. Experiments show that TurboFill outperforms both multi-step BrushNet and few-step inpainting methods, setting a new benchmark for high-performance inpainting tasks.

- **Summary**: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with Vector Quantization (VQ) has achieved great success in both self-supervised pre-training and image generation. However, most existing methods struggle to address the trade-off in shared latent space for generation quality vs. representation learning and efficiency. To push the limits of this paradigm, we propose MergeVQ, which incorporates token merging techniques into VQ-based generative models to bridge the gap between image generation and visual representation learning in a unified architecture. During pre-training, MergeVQ decouples top-k semantics from latent space with the token merge module after self-attention blocks in the encoder for subsequent Look-up Free Quantization (LFQ) and global alignment and recovers their fine-grained details through cross-attention in the decoder for reconstruction. As for the second-stage generation, we introduce MergeAR, which performs KV Cache compression for efficient raster-order prediction. Extensive experiments on ImageNet verify that MergeVQ as an AR generative model achieves competitive performance in both visual representation learning and image generation tasks while maintaining favorable token efficiency and inference speed. The code and model will be available at https://apexgen-x.github.io/MergeVQ.

- **Summary**: High spatial and temporal resolution, coupled with a strong signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), has made BOLD 7 Tesla fMRI an invaluable tool for understanding how the brain processes visual stimuli. However, the limited availability of 7T MRI systems means that most research relies on 3T MRI systems, which offer lower spatial and temporal resolution and SNR. This naturally raises the question: Can we enhance the spatiotemporal resolution and SNR of 3T BOLD fMRI data to approximate 7T quality? In this study, we propose a novel framework that aligns 7T and 3T fMRI data from different subjects and datasets in a shared parametric domain. We then apply an unpaired Brain Disk Schr\"odinger Bridge diffusion model to enhance the spatiotemporal resolution and SNR of the 3T data. Our approach addresses the challenge of limited 7T data by improving the 3T scan quality. We demonstrate its effectiveness by testing it on two distinct fMRI retinotopy datasets (one 7T and one 3T), as well as synthetic data. The results show that our method significantly improves the SNR and goodness-of-fit of the population receptive field (pRF) model in the enhanced 3T data, making it comparable to 7T quality. The codes will be available at Github.

- **Summary**: We introduce IntrinsiX, a novel method that generates high-quality intrinsic images from text description. In contrast to existing text-to-image models whose outputs contain baked-in scene lighting, our approach predicts physically-based rendering (PBR) maps. This enables the generated outputs to be used for content creation scenarios in core graphics applications that facilitate re-lighting, editing, and texture generation tasks. In order to train our generator, we exploit strong image priors, and pre-train separate models for each PBR material component (albedo, roughness, metallic, normals). We then align these models with a new cross-intrinsic attention formulation that concatenates key and value features in a consistent fashion. This allows us to exchange information between each output modality and to obtain semantically coherent PBR predictions. To ground each intrinsic component, we propose a rendering loss which provides image-space signals to constrain the model, thus facilitating sharp details also in the output BRDF properties. Our results demonstrate detailed intrinsic generation with strong generalization capabilities that outperforms existing intrinsic image decomposition methods used with generated images by a significant margin. Finally, we show a series of applications, including re-lighting, editing, and text-conditioned room-scale PBR texture generation.

- **Summary**: Pretraining a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) aggregator enables the derivation of Whole Slide Image (WSI)-level embeddings from patch-level representations without supervision. While recent multimodal MIL pretraining approaches leveraging auxiliary modalities have demonstrated performance gains over unimodal WSI pretraining, the acquisition of these additional modalities necessitates extensive clinical profiling. This requirement increases costs and limits scalability in existing WSI datasets lacking such paired modalities. To address this, we propose Gigapixel Vision-Concept Knowledge Contrastive pretraining (GECKO), which aligns WSIs with a Concept Prior derived from the available WSIs. First, we derive an inherently interpretable concept prior by computing the similarity between each WSI patch and textual descriptions of predefined pathology concepts. GECKO then employs a dual-branch MIL network: one branch aggregates patch embeddings into a WSI-level deep embedding, while the other aggregates the concept prior into a corresponding WSI-level concept embedding. Both aggregated embeddings are aligned using a contrastive objective, thereby pretraining the entire dual-branch MIL model. Moreover, when auxiliary modalities such as transcriptomics data are available, GECKO seamlessly integrates them. Across five diverse tasks, GECKO consistently outperforms prior unimodal and multimodal pretraining approaches while also delivering clinically meaningful interpretability that bridges the gap between computational models and pathology expertise.

- **Summary**: Manual labeling for large-scale image and video datasets is often time-intensive, error-prone, and costly, posing a significant barrier to efficient machine learning workflows in fault detection from railroad videos. This study introduces a semi-automated labeling method that utilizes a pre-trained You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to streamline the labeling process and enhance fault detection accuracy in railroad videos. By initiating the process with a small set of manually labeled data, our approach iteratively trains the YOLO model, using each cycle's output to improve model accuracy and progressively reduce the need for human intervention.   To facilitate easy correction of model predictions, we developed a system to export YOLO's detection data as an editable text file, enabling rapid adjustments when detections require refinement. This approach decreases labeling time from an average of 2 to 4 minutes per image to 30 seconds to 2 minutes, effectively minimizing labor costs and labeling errors. Unlike costly AI based labeling solutions on paid platforms, our method provides a cost-effective alternative for researchers and practitioners handling large datasets in fault detection and other detection based machine learning applications.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in image and video synthesis have opened up new promise in generative games. One particularly intriguing application is transforming characters from anime films into interactive, playable entities. This allows players to immerse themselves in the dynamic anime world as their favorite characters for life simulation through language instructions. Such games are defined as infinite game since they eliminate predetermined boundaries and fixed gameplay rules, where players can interact with the game world through open-ended language and experience ever-evolving storylines and environments. Recently, a pioneering approach for infinite anime life simulation employs large language models (LLMs) to translate multi-turn text dialogues into language instructions for image generation. However, it neglects historical visual context, leading to inconsistent gameplay. Furthermore, it only generates static images, failing to incorporate the dynamics necessary for an engaging gaming experience. In this work, we propose AnimeGamer, which is built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate each game state, including dynamic animation shots that depict character movements and updates to character states, as illustrated in Figure 1. We introduce novel action-aware multimodal representations to represent animation shots, which can be decoded into high-quality video clips using a video diffusion model. By taking historical animation shot representations as context and predicting subsequent representations, AnimeGamer can generate games with contextual consistency and satisfactory dynamics. Extensive evaluations using both automated metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that AnimeGamer outperforms existing methods in various aspects of the gaming experience.

- **Summary**: Despite remarkable advancements in video depth estimation, existing methods exhibit inherent limitations in achieving geometric fidelity through the affine-invariant predictions, limiting their applicability in reconstruction and other metrically grounded downstream tasks. We propose GeometryCrafter, a novel framework that recovers high-fidelity point map sequences with temporal coherence from open-world videos, enabling accurate 3D/4D reconstruction, camera parameter estimation, and other depth-based applications. At the core of our approach lies a point map Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that learns a latent space agnostic to video latent distributions for effective point map encoding and decoding. Leveraging the VAE, we train a video diffusion model to model the distribution of point map sequences conditioned on the input videos. Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate that GeometryCrafter achieves state-of-the-art 3D accuracy, temporal consistency, and generalization capability.

- **Summary**: Visual Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) currently underperforms Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in multimodal settings such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). This multimodal gap is often attributed to the semantics introduced by language supervision, even though visual SSL and CLIP models are often trained on different data. In this work, we ask the question: "Do visual self-supervised approaches lag behind CLIP due to the lack of language supervision, or differences in the training data?" We study this question by training both visual SSL and CLIP models on the same MetaCLIP data, and leveraging VQA as a diverse testbed for vision encoders. In this controlled setup, visual SSL models scale better than CLIP models in terms of data and model capacity, and visual SSL performance does not saturate even after scaling up to 7B parameters. Consequently, we observe visual SSL methods achieve CLIP-level performance on a wide range of VQA and classic vision benchmarks. These findings demonstrate that pure visual SSL can match language-supervised visual pretraining at scale, opening new opportunities for vision-centric representation learning.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Generating human motion guided by conditions such as textual descriptions is challenging due to the need for datasets with pairs of high-quality motion and their corresponding conditions. The difficulty increases when aiming for finer control in the generation. To that end, prior works have proposed to combine several motion diffusion models pre-trained on datasets with different types of conditions, thus allowing control with multiple conditions. However, the proposed merging strategies overlook that the optimal way to combine the generation processes might depend on the particularities of each pre-trained generative model and also the specific textual descriptions. In this context, we introduce MixerMDM, the first learnable model composition technique for combining pre-trained text-conditioned human motion diffusion models. Unlike previous approaches, MixerMDM provides a dynamic mixing strategy that is trained in an adversarial fashion to learn to combine the denoising process of each model depending on the set of conditions driving the generation. By using MixerMDM to combine single- and multi-person motion diffusion models, we achieve fine-grained control on the dynamics of every person individually, and also on the overall interaction. Furthermore, we propose a new evaluation technique that, for the first time in this task, measures the interaction and individual quality by computing the alignment between the mixed generated motions and their conditions as well as the capabilities of MixerMDM to adapt the mixing throughout the denoising process depending on the motions to mix.

- **Summary**: Our objective is the automatic generation of Audio Descriptions (ADs) for edited video material, such as movies and TV series. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage framework that leverages "shots" as the fundamental units of video understanding. This includes extending temporal context to neighbouring shots and incorporating film grammar devices, such as shot scales and thread structures, to guide AD generation. Our method is compatible with both open-source and proprietary Visual-Language Models (VLMs), integrating expert knowledge from add-on modules without requiring additional training of the VLMs. We achieve state-of-the-art performance among all prior training-free approaches and even surpass fine-tuned methods on several benchmarks. To evaluate the quality of predicted ADs, we introduce a new evaluation measure -- an action score -- specifically targeted to assessing this important aspect of AD. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that treats automatic frameworks as AD generation assistants and asks them to generate multiple candidate ADs for selection.

This model provides robust safety risk predictions across the following key harm categories: Sexually Explicit, Violence \& Gore, and Dangerous Content for synthetic images (e.g. output of any image generation model) and natural images (e.g. any image input to a Vision-Language Model). We evaluated on both internal and external benchmarks to demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to LlavaGuard \citep{helff2024llavaguard}, GPT-4o mini \citep{hurst2024gpt}, and the base Gemma 3 model \citep{gemma_2025} based on our policies. Additionally, we present a novel adversarial data generation pipeline which enables a controlled, diverse, and robust image generation. ShieldGemma 2 provides an open image moderation tool to advance multimodal safety and responsible AI development.

- **Summary**: Rip currents are strong, localized and narrow currents of water that flow outwards into the sea, causing numerous beach-related injuries and fatalities worldwide. Accurate identification of rip currents remains challenging due to their amorphous nature and the lack of annotated data, which often requires expert knowledge. To address these issues, we present RipVIS, a large-scale video instance segmentation benchmark explicitly designed for rip current segmentation. RipVIS is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets, featuring $184$ videos ($212,328$ frames), of which $150$ videos ($163,528$ frames) are with rip currents, collected from various sources, including drones, mobile phones, and fixed beach cameras. Our dataset encompasses diverse visual contexts, such as wave-breaking patterns, sediment flows, and water color variations, across multiple global locations, including USA, Mexico, Costa Rica, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Romania, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand. Most videos are annotated at $5$ FPS to ensure accuracy in dynamic scenarios, supplemented by an additional $34$ videos ($48,800$ frames) without rip currents. We conduct comprehensive experiments with Mask R-CNN, Cascade Mask R-CNN, SparseInst and YOLO11, fine-tuning these models for the task of rip current segmentation. Results are reported in terms of multiple metrics, with a particular focus on the $F_2$ score to prioritize recall and reduce false negatives. To enhance segmentation performance, we introduce a novel post-processing step based on Temporal Confidence Aggregation (TCA). RipVIS aims to set a new standard for rip current segmentation, contributing towards safer beach environments. We offer a benchmark website to share data, models, and results with the research community, encouraging ongoing collaboration and future contributions, at https://ripvis.ai.

- **Summary**: We present Articulated Kinematics Distillation (AKD), a framework for generating high-fidelity character animations by merging the strengths of skeleton-based animation and modern generative models. AKD uses a skeleton-based representation for rigged 3D assets, drastically reducing the Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) by focusing on joint-level control, which allows for efficient, consistent motion synthesis. Through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with pre-trained video diffusion models, AKD distills complex, articulated motions while maintaining structural integrity, overcoming challenges faced by 4D neural deformation fields in preserving shape consistency. This approach is naturally compatible with physics-based simulation, ensuring physically plausible interactions. Experiments show that AKD achieves superior 3D consistency and motion quality compared with existing works on text-to-4D generation. Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/akd/

To address these limitations, we introduce GRU-AUNet, a domain adaptation approach that integrates a Swin Transformer-based UNet architecture with GRU-enhanced attention mechanisms, a Dynamic Filter Network in the bottleneck, and a combined Focal and Contrastive Loss function. Trained in both genuine and spoof fingerprint images, GRU-AUNet demonstrates robust resilience against presentation attacks, achieving an average BPCER of 0.09\% and APCER of 1.2\% in the CLARKSON, COLFISPOOF, and IIITD datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have achieved significant success in various image related tasks. However, they often encounter challenges related to computational complexity and overfitting. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach that leverages polygonal representations of images using dominant points or contour coordinates. By transforming input images into these compact forms, our method significantly reduces computational requirements, accelerates training, and conserves resources making it suitable for real time and resource constrained applications. These representations inherently capture essential image features while filtering noise, providing a natural regularization effect that mitigates overfitting. The resulting lightweight models achieve performance comparable to state of the art methods using full resolution images while enabling deployment on edge devices. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing complexity, improving generalization, and facilitating edge computing applications. This work demonstrates the potential of polygonal representations in advancing efficient and scalable deep learning solutions for real world scenarios.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art generative models exhibit powerful image-generation capabilities, introducing various ethical and legal challenges to service providers hosting these models. Consequently, Content Removal Techniques (CRTs) have emerged as a growing area of research to control outputs without full-scale retraining. Recent work has explored the use of Machine Unlearning in generative models to address content removal. However, the focus of such research has been on diffusion models, and unlearning in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has remained largely unexplored. We address this gap by proposing Text-to-Unlearn, a novel framework that selectively unlearns concepts from pre-trained GANs using only text prompts, enabling feature unlearning, identity unlearning, and fine-grained tasks like expression and multi-attribute removal in models trained on human faces. Leveraging natural language descriptions, our approach guides the unlearning process without requiring additional datasets or supervised fine-tuning, offering a scalable and efficient solution. To evaluate its effectiveness, we introduce an automatic unlearning assessment method adapted from state-of-the-art image-text alignment metrics, providing a comprehensive analysis of the unlearning methodology. To our knowledge, Text-to-Unlearn is the first cross-modal unlearning framework for GANs, representing a flexible and efficient advancement in managing generative model behavior.

- **Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a novel approach to noninvasive monitoring of vital signs, such as respiratory rate, utilizing a camera. Although several supervised and self-supervised methods have been proposed, they often fail to accurately reconstruct the PPG signal, particularly in distinguishing between systolic and diastolic components. Their primary focus tends to be solely on extracting heart rate, which may not accurately represent the complete PPG signal. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture using Generative Adversarial Networks by introducing multi-discriminators to extract rPPG signals from facial videos. These discriminators focus on the time domain, the frequency domain, and the second derivative of the original time domain signal. The discriminator integrates four loss functions: variance loss to mitigate local minima caused by noise; dynamic time warping loss to address local minima induced by alignment and sequences of variable lengths; Sparsity Loss for heart rate adjustment, and Variance Loss to ensure a uniform distribution across the desired frequency domain and time interval between systolic and diastolic phases of the PPG signal.

- **Summary**: This study explores current limitations of learned image captioning evaluation metrics, specifically the lack of granular assessment for individual word misalignments within captions, and the reliance on single-point quality estimates without considering uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective strategy for generating and calibrating CLIPScore distributions. Leveraging a model-agnostic conformal risk control framework, we calibrate CLIPScore values for task-specific control variables, to tackle the aforementioned two limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that using conformal risk control, over the distributions produced with simple methods such as input masking, can achieve competitive performance compared to more complex approaches. Our method effectively detects misaligned words, while providing formal guarantees aligned with desired risk levels, and improving the correlation between uncertainty estimations and prediction errors, thus enhancing the overall reliability of caption evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in computer vision but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in black-box settings where model details are unknown. Existing adversarial attack methods(even those works with key frames) often treat video data as simple vectors, ignoring their inherent multi-dimensional structure, and require a large number of queries, making them inefficient and detectable. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TenAd}, a novel tensor-based low-rank adversarial attack that leverages the multi-dimensional properties of video data by representing videos as fourth-order tensors. By exploiting low-rank attack, our method significantly reduces the search space and the number of queries needed to generate adversarial examples in black-box settings. Experimental results on standard video classification datasets demonstrate that \textbf{TenAd} effectively generates imperceptible adversarial perturbations while achieving higher attack success rates and query efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach outperforms existing black-box adversarial attacks in terms of success rate, query efficiency, and perturbation imperceptibility, highlighting the potential of tensor-based methods for adversarial attacks on video models.

- **Summary**: Underwater images suffer from severe degradations, including color distortions, reduced visibility, and loss of structural details due to wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing enhancement methods primarily focus on spatial-domain processing, neglecting the frequency domain's potential to capture global color distributions and long-range dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose FUSION, a dual-domain deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and frequency domain information. FUSION independently processes each RGB channel through multi-scale convolutional kernels and adaptive attention mechanisms in the spatial domain, while simultaneously extracting global structural information via FFT-based frequency attention. A Frequency Guided Fusion module integrates complementary features from both domains, followed by inter-channel fusion and adaptive channel recalibration to ensure balanced color distributions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (UIEB, EUVP, SUIM-E) demonstrate that FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in reconstruction fidelity (highest PSNR of 23.717 dB and SSIM of 0.883 on UIEB), perceptual quality (lowest LPIPS of 0.112 on UIEB), and visual enhancement metrics (best UIQM of 3.414 on UIEB), while requiring significantly fewer parameters (0.28M) and lower computational complexity, demonstrating its suitability for real-time underwater imaging applications.
