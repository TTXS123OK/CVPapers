- **Summary**: Parametric CAD models, represented as Boundary Representations (B-reps), are foundational to modern design and manufacturing workflows, offering the precision and topological breakdown required for downstream tasks such as analysis, editing, and fabrication. However, B-Reps are often inaccessible due to conversion to more standardized, less expressive geometry formats. Existing methods to recover B-Reps from measured data require complete, noise-free 3D data, which are laborious to obtain. We alleviate this difficulty by enabling the precise reconstruction of CAD shapes from a single RGB-D image. We propose a method that addresses the challenge of reconstructing only the observed geometry from a single view. To allow for these partial observations, and to avoid hallucinating incorrect geometry, we introduce a novel view-centric B-rep (VB-Rep) representation, which incorporates structures to handle visibility limits and encode geometric uncertainty. We combine panoptic image segmentation with iterative geometric optimization to refine and improve the reconstruction process. Our results demonstrate high-quality reconstruction on synthetic and real RGB-D data, showing that our method can bridge the reality gap.

- **Summary**: Pursuing efficient text shape representations helps scene text detection models focus on compact foreground regions and optimize the contour reconstruction steps to simplify the whole detection pipeline. Current approaches either represent irregular shapes via box-to-polygon strategy or decomposing a contour into pieces for fitting gradually, the deficiency of coarse contours or complex pipelines always exists in these models. Considering the above issues, we introduce EdgeText to fit text contours compactly while alleviating excessive contour rebuilding processes. Concretely, it is observed that the two long edges of texts can be regarded as smooth curves. It allows us to build contours via continuous and smooth edges that cover text regions tightly instead of fitting piecewise, which helps avoid the two limitations in current models. Inspired by this observation, EdgeText formulates the text representation as the edge approximation problem via parameterized curve fitting functions. In the inference stage, our model starts with locating text centers, and then creating curve functions for approximating text edges relying on the points. Meanwhile, truncation points are determined based on the location features. In the end, extracting curve segments from curve functions by using the pixel coordinate information brought by truncation points to reconstruct text contours. Furthermore, considering the deep dependency of EdgeText on text edges, a bilateral enhanced perception (BEP) module is designed. It encourages our model to pay attention to the recognition of edge features. Additionally, to accelerate the learning of the curve function parameters, we introduce a proportional integral loss (PI-loss) to force the proposed model to focus on the curve distribution and avoid being disturbed by text scales.

- **Summary**: Generating naturalistic and nuanced listener motions for extended interactions remains an open problem. Existing methods often rely on low-dimensional motion codes for facial behavior generation followed by photorealistic rendering, limiting both visual fidelity and expressive richness. To address these challenges, we introduce DiTaiListener, powered by a video diffusion model with multimodal conditions. Our approach first generates short segments of listener responses conditioned on the speaker's speech and facial motions with DiTaiListener-Gen. It then refines the transitional frames via DiTaiListener-Edit for a seamless transition. Specifically, DiTaiListener-Gen adapts a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for the task of listener head portrait generation by introducing a Causal Temporal Multimodal Adapter (CTM-Adapter) to process speakers' auditory and visual cues. CTM-Adapter integrates speakers' input in a causal manner into the video generation process to ensure temporally coherent listener responses. For long-form video generation, we introduce DiTaiListener-Edit, a transition refinement video-to-video diffusion model. The model fuses video segments into smooth and continuous videos, ensuring temporal consistency in facial expressions and image quality when merging short video segments produced by DiTaiListener-Gen. Quantitatively, DiTaiListener achieves the state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets in both photorealism (+73.8% in FID on RealTalk) and motion representation (+6.1% in FD metric on VICO) spaces. User studies confirm the superior performance of DiTaiListener, with the model being the clear preference in terms of feedback, diversity, and smoothness, outperforming competitors by a significant margin.

- **Summary**: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images captured using thermal detectors are often affected by temperature dependent low-frequency nonuniformity, which significantly reduces the contrast of the images. Detecting UAV targets under nonuniform conditions is crucial in UAV surveillance applications. Existing methods typically treat infrared nonuniformity correction (NUC) as a preprocessing step for detection, which leads to suboptimal performance. Balancing the two tasks while enhancing detection beneficial information remains challenging. In this paper, we present a detection-friendly union framework, termed UniCD, that simultaneously addresses both infrared NUC and UAV target detection tasks in an end-to-end manner. We first model NUC as a small number of parameter estimation problem jointly driven by priors and data to generate detection-conducive images. Then, we incorporate a new auxiliary loss with target mask supervision into the backbone of the infrared UAV target detection network to strengthen target features while suppressing the background. To better balance correction and detection, we introduce a detection-guided self-supervised loss to reduce feature discrepancies between the two tasks, thereby enhancing detection robustness to varying nonuniformity levels. Additionally, we construct a new benchmark composed of 50,000 infrared images in various nonuniformity types, multi-scale UAV targets and rich backgrounds with target annotations, called IRBFD. Extensive experiments on IRBFD demonstrate that our UniCD is a robust union framework for NUC and UAV target detection while achieving real-time processing capabilities.

- **Summary**: To effectively reduce the visual tokens in Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs), we propose a novel approach called Window Token Concatenation (WiCo). Specifically, we employ a sliding window to concatenate spatially adjacent visual tokens. However, directly concatenating these tokens may group diverse tokens into one, and thus obscure some fine details. To address this challenge, we propose fine-tuning the last few layers of the vision encoder to adaptively adjust the visual tokens, encouraging that those within the same window exhibit similar features. To further enhance the performance on fine-grained visual understanding tasks, we introduce WiCo+, which decomposes the visual tokens in later layers of the LLM. Such a design enjoys the merits of the large perception field of the LLM for fine-grained visual understanding while keeping a small number of visual tokens for efficient inference. We perform extensive experiments on both coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding tasks based on LLaVA-1.5 and Shikra, showing better performance compared with existing token reduction projectors. The code is available: https://github.com/JackYFL/WiCo.

- **Summary**: Recently, vision transformers were shown to be capable of outperforming convolutional neural networks when pretrained on sufficiently large datasets. Vision transformer models show good accuracy on large scale datasets, with features of multi-modal training. Due to their promising feature detection, we aim to explore vision transformer models for diagnosis of anaplastic large cell lymphoma versus classical Hodgkin lymphoma using pathology whole slide images of HE slides. We compared the classification performance of the vision transformer to our previously designed convolutional neural network on the same dataset. The dataset includes whole slide images of HE slides for 20 cases, including 10 cases in each diagnostic category. From each whole slide image, 60 image patches having size of 100 by 100 pixels and at magnification of 20 were obtained to yield 1200 image patches, from which 90 percent were used for training, 9 percent for validation, and 10 percent for testing. The test results from the convolutional neural network model had previously shown an excellent diagnostic accuracy of 100 percent. The test results from the vision transformer model also showed a comparable accuracy at 100 percent. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first direct comparison of predictive performance between a vision transformer model and a convolutional neural network model using the same dataset of lymphoma. Overall, convolutional neural network has a more mature architecture than vision transformer and is usually the best choice when large scale pretraining is not an available option. Nevertheless, our current study shows comparable and excellent accuracy of vision transformer compared to that of convolutional neural network even with a relatively small dataset of anaplastic large cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

- **Summary**: Event cameras are emerging vision sensors, whose noise is challenging to characterize. Existing denoising methods for event cameras consider other tasks such as motion estimation separately (i.e., sequentially after denoising). However, motion is an intrinsic part of event data, since scene edges cannot be sensed without motion. This work proposes, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that simultaneously estimates motion in its various forms (e.g., ego-motion, optical flow) and noise. The method is flexible, as it allows replacing the 1-step motion estimation of the widely-used Contrast Maximization framework with any other motion estimator, such as deep neural networks. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the E-MLB denoising benchmark and competitive results on the DND21 benchmark, while showing its efficacy on motion estimation and intensity reconstruction tasks. We believe that the proposed approach contributes to strengthening the theory of event-data denoising, as well as impacting practical denoising use-cases, as we release the code upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Curvilinear structure segmentation (CSS) is vital in various domains, including medical imaging, landscape analysis, industrial surface inspection, and plant analysis. While existing methods achieve high performance within specific domains, their generalizability is limited. On the other hand, large-scale models such as Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit strong generalization but are not optimized for curvilinear structures. Existing adaptations of SAM primarily focus on general object segmentation and lack specialized design for CSS tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose the Universal Curvilinear structure Segmentation (\textit{UCS}) model, which adapts SAM to CSS tasks while enhancing its generalization. \textit{UCS} features a novel encoder architecture integrating a pretrained SAM encoder with two innovations: a Sparse Adapter, strategically inserted to inherit the pre-trained SAM encoder's generalization capability while minimizing the number of fine-tuning parameters, and a Prompt Generation module, which leverages Fast Fourier Transform with a high-pass filter to generate curve-specific prompts. Furthermore, the \textit{UCS} incorporates a mask decoder that eliminates reliance on manual interaction through a dual-compression module: a Hierarchical Feature Compression module, which aggregates the outputs of the sampled encoder to enhance detail preservation, and a Guidance Feature Compression module, which extracts and compresses image-driven guidance features. Evaluated on a comprehensive multi-domain dataset, including an in-house dataset covering eight natural curvilinear structures, \textit{UCS} demonstrates state-of-the-art generalization and open-set segmentation performance across medical, engineering, natural, and plant imagery, establishing a new benchmark for universal CSS.

- **Summary**: Computational pathology, analyzing whole slide images for automated cancer diagnosis, relies on the multiple instance learning framework where performance heavily depends on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced capabilities of extractors and aggregators but lack systematic analysis frameworks. This survey presents a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy that can be utilized to analyze FMs in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

- **Summary**: Generative models have driven significant progress in a variety of AI tasks, including text-to-video generation, where models like Video LDM and Stable Video Diffusion can produce realistic, movie-level videos from textual instructions. Despite these advances, current text-to-video models still face fundamental challenges in reliably following human commands, particularly in adhering to simple numerical constraints. In this work, we present T2VCountBench, a specialized benchmark aiming at evaluating the counting capability of SOTA text-to-video models as of 2025. Our benchmark employs rigorous human evaluations to measure the number of generated objects and covers a diverse range of generators, covering both open-source and commercial models. Extensive experiments reveal that all existing models struggle with basic numerical tasks, almost always failing to generate videos with an object count of 9 or fewer. Furthermore, our comprehensive ablation studies explore how factors like video style, temporal dynamics, and multilingual inputs may influence counting performance. We also explore prompt refinement techniques and demonstrate that decomposing the task into smaller subtasks does not easily alleviate these limitations. Our findings highlight important challenges in current text-to-video generation and provide insights for future research aimed at improving adherence to basic numerical constraints.

- **Summary**: Knowledge-based Vision Question Answering (KB-VQA) systems address complex visual-grounded questions requiring external knowledge, such as web-sourced encyclopedia articles. Existing methods often use sequential and separate frameworks for the retriever and the generator with limited parametric knowledge sharing. However, since both retrieval and generation tasks require accurate understanding of contextual and external information, such separation can potentially lead to suboptimal system performance. Another key challenge is the integration of multimodal information. General-purpose multimodal pre-trained models, while adept at multimodal representation learning, struggle with fine-grained retrieval required for knowledge-intensive visual questions. Recent specialized pre-trained models mitigate the issue, but are computationally expensive. To bridge the gap, we propose a Unified Retrieval-Augmented VQA framework (UniRVQA). UniRVQA adapts general multimodal pre-trained models for fine-grained knowledge-intensive tasks within a unified framework, enabling cross-task parametric knowledge sharing and the extension of existing multimodal representation learning capability. We further introduce a reflective-answering mechanism that allows the model to explicitly evaluate and refine its knowledge boundary. Additionally, we integrate late interaction into the retrieval-augmented generation joint training process to enhance fine-grained understanding of queries and documents. Our approach achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art models, delivering a significant 4.7% improvement in answering accuracy, and brings an average 7.5% boost in base MLLMs' VQA performance.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks like U-Net excel in medical image segmentation, while attention mechanisms and KAN enhance feature extraction. Meta's SAM 2 uses Vision Transformers for prompt-based segmentation without fine-tuning. However, biases in these models impact generalization with limited data. In this study, we systematically evaluate and compare the performance of three CNN-based models, i.e., U-Net, Attention U-Net, and U-KAN, and one transformer-based model, i.e., SAM 2 for segmenting femur bone structures in MRI scan. The dataset comprises 11,164 MRI scans with detailed annotations of femoral regions. Performance is assessed using the Dice Similarity Coefficient, which ranges from 0.932 to 0.954. Attention U-Net achieves the highest overall scores, while U-KAN demonstrated superior performance in anatomical regions with a smaller region of interest, leveraging its enhanced learning capacity to improve segmentation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Document image segmentation is crucial for document analysis and recognition but remains challenging due to the diversity of document formats and segmentation tasks. Existing methods often address these tasks separately, resulting in limited generalization and resource wastage. This paper introduces DocSAM, a transformer-based unified framework designed for various document image segmentation tasks, such as document layout analysis, multi-granularity text segmentation, and table structure recognition, by modelling these tasks as a combination of instance and semantic segmentation. Specifically, DocSAM employs Sentence-BERT to map category names from each dataset into semantic queries that match the dimensionality of instance queries. These two sets of queries interact through an attention mechanism and are cross-attended with image features to predict instance and semantic segmentation masks. Instance categories are predicted by computing the dot product between instance and semantic queries, followed by softmax normalization of scores. Consequently, DocSAM can be jointly trained on heterogeneous datasets, enhancing robustness and generalization while reducing computational and storage resources. Comprehensive evaluations show that DocSAM surpasses existing methods in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, highlighting its potential for advancing document image understanding and segmentation across various applications.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks; however, the challenge of hallucinations constrains their practical applications. The hallucination problem arises from multiple factors, including the inherent hallucinations in language models, the limitations of visual encoders in perception, and biases introduced by multimodal data. Extensive research has explored ways to mitigate hallucinations. For instance, OPERA prevents the model from overly focusing on "anchor tokens", thereby reducing hallucinations, whereas VCD mitigates hallucinations by employing a contrastive decoding approach. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between the decay of attention to image tokens and the occurrence of hallucinations. Based on this finding, we propose Temporal Attention Real-time Accumulative Connection (TARAC), a novel training-free method that dynamically accumulates and updates LVLMs' attention on image tokens during generation. By enhancing the model's attention to image tokens, TARAC mitigates hallucinations caused by the decay of attention on image tokens. We validate the effectiveness of TARAC across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that our approach substantially mitigates hallucinations. In particular, TARAC reduces $C_S$ by 25.2 and $C_I$ by 8.7 compared to VCD on the CHAIR benchmark.

- **Summary**: The surge of deep learning has catalyzed considerable progress in self-supervised Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection (HAD). The core premise for self-supervised HAD is that anomalous pixels are inherently more challenging to reconstruct, resulting in larger errors compared to the background. However, owing to the powerful nonlinear fitting capabilities of neural networks, self-supervised models often suffer from the Identity Mapping Problem (IMP). The IMP manifests as a tendency for the model to overfit to the entire image, particularly with increasing network complexity or prolonged training iterations. Consequently, the whole image can be precisely reconstructed, and even the anomalous pixels exhibit imperceptible errors, making them difficult to detect. Despite the proposal of several models aimed at addressing the IMP-related issues, a unified descriptive framework and validation of solutions for IMP remain lacking. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth exploration to IMP, and summarize a unified framework that describes IMP from the perspective of network optimization, which encompasses three aspects: perturbation, reconstruction, and regularization. Correspondingly, we introduce three solutions: superpixel pooling and uppooling for perturbation, error-adaptive convolution for reconstruction, and online background pixel mining for regularization. With extensive experiments being conducted to validate the effectiveness, it is hoped that our work will provide valuable insights and inspire further research for self-supervised HAD.

- **Summary**: Event cameras have higher temporal resolution, and require less storage and bandwidth compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, due to relatively lagging performance of event-based approaches, event cameras have not yet replace traditional cameras in performance-critical applications like autonomous driving. Recent approaches in event-based object detection try to bridge this gap by employing computationally expensive transformer-based solutions. However, due to their resource-intensive components, these solutions fail to exploit the sparsity and higher temporal resolution of event cameras efficiently. Moreover, these solutions are adopted from the vision domain, lacking specificity to the event cameras. In this work, we explore efficient and performant alternatives to recurrent vision transformer models and propose a novel event-based object detection backbone. The proposed backbone employs a novel Event Progression Extractor module, tailored specifically for event data, and uses Metaformer concept with convolution-based efficient components. We evaluate the resultant model on well-established traffic object detection benchmarks and conduct cross-dataset evaluation to test its ability to generalize. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on Prophesee Gen1 dataset by 1.6 mAP while reducing inference time by 14%. Our proposed EMF becomes the fastest DNN-based architecture in the domain by outperforming most efficient event-based object detectors. Moreover, the proposed model shows better ability to generalize to unseen data and scales better with the abundance of data.

- **Summary**: Generating human videos from a single image while ensuring high visual quality and precise control is a challenging task, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple individuals and interactions with objects. Existing methods, while effective for single-human cases, often fail to handle the intricacies of multi-identity interactions because they struggle to associate the correct pairs of human appearance and pose condition and model the distribution of 3D-aware dynamics. To address these limitations, we present Structural Video Diffusion, a novel framework designed for generating realistic multi-human videos. Our approach introduces two core innovations: identity-specific embeddings to maintain consistent appearances across individuals and a structural learning mechanism that incorporates depth and surface-normal cues to model human-object interactions. Additionally, we expand existing human video dataset with 25K new videos featuring diverse multi-human and object interaction scenarios, providing a robust foundation for training. Experimental results demonstrate that Structural Video Diffusion achieves superior performance in generating lifelike, coherent videos for multiple subjects with dynamic and rich interactions, advancing the state of human-centric video generation.

- **Summary**: In the field of deep learning, large architectures often obtain the best performance for many tasks, but also require massive datasets. In the histological domain, tissue images are expensive to obtain and constitute sensitive medical information, raising concerns about data scarcity and privacy. Vision Transformers are state-of-the-art computer vision models that have proven helpful in many tasks, including image classification. In this work, we combine vision Transformers with generative adversarial networks to generate histopathological images related to colorectal cancer and test their quality by augmenting a training dataset, leading to improved classification accuracy. Then, we replicate this performance using the federated learning technique and a realistic Kubernetes setup with multiple nodes, simulating a scenario where the training dataset is split among several hospitals unable to share their information directly due to privacy concerns.

- **Summary**: The advancement of 4D (i.e., sequential 3D) generation opens up new possibilities for lifelike experiences in various applications, where users can explore dynamic objects or characters from any viewpoint. Meanwhile, video generative models are receiving particular attention given their ability to produce realistic and imaginative frames. These models are also observed to exhibit strong 3D consistency, indicating the potential to act as world simulators. In this work, we present Video4DGen, a novel framework that excels in generating 4D representations from single or multiple generated videos as well as generating 4D-guided videos. This framework is pivotal for creating high-fidelity virtual contents that maintain both spatial and temporal coherence. The 4D outputs generated by Video4DGen are represented using our proposed Dynamic Gaussian Surfels (DGS), which optimizes time-varying warping functions to transform Gaussian surfels (surface elements) from a static state to a dynamically warped state. We design warped-state geometric regularization and refinements on Gaussian surfels, to preserve the structural integrity and fine-grained appearance details. To perform 4D generation from multiple videos and capture representation across spatial, temporal, and pose dimensions, we design multi-video alignment, root pose optimization, and pose-guided frame sampling strategies. The leveraging of continuous warping fields also enables a precise depiction of pose, motion, and deformation over per-video frames. Further, to improve the overall fidelity from the observation of all camera poses, Video4DGen performs novel-view video generation guided by the 4D content, with the proposed confidence-filtered DGS to enhance the quality of generated sequences. With the ability of 4D and video generation, Video4DGen offers a powerful tool for applications in virtual reality, animation, and beyond.

- **Summary**: Effective Class Incremental Segmentation (CIS) requires simultaneously mitigating catastrophic forgetting and ensuring sufficient plasticity to integrate new classes. The inherent conflict above often leads to a back-and-forth, which turns the objective into finding the balance between the performance of previous~(old) and incremental~(new) classes. To address this conflict, we introduce a novel approach, Conflict Mitigation via Branched Optimization~(CoMBO). Within this approach, we present the Query Conflict Reduction module, designed to explicitly refine queries for new classes through lightweight, class-specific adapters. This module provides an additional branch for the acquisition of new classes while preserving the original queries for distillation. Moreover, we develop two strategies to further mitigate the conflict following the branched structure, \textit{i.e.}, the Half-Learning Half-Distillation~(HDHL) over classification probabilities, and the Importance-Based Knowledge Distillation~(IKD) over query features. HDHL selectively engages in learning for classification probabilities of queries that match the ground truth of new classes, while aligning unmatched ones to the corresponding old probabilities, thus ensuring retention of old knowledge while absorbing new classes via learning negative samples. Meanwhile, IKD assesses the importance of queries based on their matching degree to old classes, prioritizing the distillation of important features and allowing less critical features to evolve. Extensive experiments in Class Incremental Panoptic and Semantic Segmentation settings have demonstrated the superior performance of CoMBO. Project page: https://guangyu-ryan.github.io/CoMBO.

- **Summary**: Vision-centric perception systems struggle with unpredictable and coupled weather degradations in the wild. Current solutions are often limited, as they either depend on specific degradation priors or suffer from significant domain gaps. To enable robust and autonomous operation in real-world conditions, we propose JarvisIR, a VLM-powered agent that leverages the VLM as a controller to manage multiple expert restoration models. To further enhance system robustness, reduce hallucinations, and improve generalizability in real-world adverse weather, JarvisIR employs a novel two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning and human feedback alignment. Specifically, to address the lack of paired data in real-world scenarios, the human feedback alignment enables the VLM to be fine-tuned effectively on large-scale real-world data in an unsupervised manner. To support the training and evaluation of JarvisIR, we introduce CleanBench, a comprehensive dataset consisting of high-quality and large-scale instruction-responses pairs, including 150K synthetic entries and 80K real entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JarvisIR exhibits superior decision-making and restoration capabilities. Compared with existing methods, it achieves a 50% improvement in the average of all perception metrics on CleanBench-Real. Project page: https://cvpr2025-jarvisir.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Reviewing the progress in artificial intelligence over the past decade, various significant advances (e.g. object detection, image generation, large language models) have enabled AI systems to produce more semantically meaningful outputs and achieve widespread adoption in internet scenarios. Nevertheless, AI systems still struggle when it comes to understanding and interacting with the physical world. This reveals an important issue: relying solely on semantic-level concepts learned from internet data (e.g. texts, images) to understand the physical world is far from sufficient -- machine intelligence currently lacks an effective way to learn about the physical world. This research introduces the idea of analytic concept -- representing the concepts related to the physical world through programs of mathematical procedures, providing machine intelligence a portal to perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Except for detailing the design philosophy and providing guidelines for the application of analytic concepts, this research also introduce about the infrastructure that has been built around analytic concepts. I aim for my research to contribute to addressing these questions: What is a proper abstraction of general concepts in the physical world for machine intelligence? How to systematically integrate structured priors with neural networks to constrain AI systems to comply with physical laws?

- **Summary**: Regularization methods using prior knowledge are essential in solving ill-posed inverse problems such as Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). However, designing effective regularization and integrating prior information into EIT remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of anatomical structures. In this work, we introduce SDEIT, a novel semantic-driven framework that integrates Stable Diffusion 3.5 into EIT, marking the first use of large-scale text-to-image generation models in EIT. SDEIT employs natural language prompts as semantic priors to guide the reconstruction process. By coupling an implicit neural representation (INR) network with a plug-and-play optimization scheme that leverages SD-generated images as generative priors, SDEIT improves structural consistency and recovers fine details. Importantly, this method does not rely on paired training datasets, increasing its adaptability to varied EIT scenarios. Extensive experiments on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that SDEIT outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, offering superior accuracy and robustness. This work opens a new pathway for integrating multimodal priors into ill-posed inverse problems like EIT.

- **Summary**: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently marked a significant advancement in 3D reconstruction, delivering both rapid rendering and high-quality results. However, existing 3DGS methods pose challenges in understanding underlying 3D semantics, which hinders model controllability and interpretability. To address it, we propose an interpretable single-view 3DGS framework, termed 3DisGS, to discover both coarse- and fine-grained 3D semantics via hierarchical disentangled representation learning (DRL). Specifically, the model employs a dual-branch architecture, consisting of a point cloud initialization branch and a triplane-Gaussian generation branch, to achieve coarse-grained disentanglement by separating 3D geometry and visual appearance features. Subsequently, fine-grained semantic representations within each modality are further discovered through DRL-based encoder-adapters. To our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve unsupervised interpretable 3DGS. Evaluations indicate that our model achieves 3D disentanglement while preserving high-quality and rapid reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Learning open-vocabulary physical skills for simulated agents presents a significant challenge in artificial intelligence. Current reinforcement learning approaches face critical limitations: manually designed rewards lack scalability across diverse tasks, while demonstration-based methods struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. We introduce GROVE, a generalized reward framework that enables open-vocabulary physical skill learning without manual engineering or task-specific demonstrations. Our key insight is that Large Language Models(LLMs) and Vision Language Models(VLMs) provide complementary guidance -- LLMs generate precise physical constraints capturing task requirements, while VLMs evaluate motion semantics and naturalness. Through an iterative design process, VLM-based feedback continuously refines LLM-generated constraints, creating a self-improving reward system. To bridge the domain gap between simulation and natural images, we develop Pose2CLIP, a lightweight mapper that efficiently projects agent poses directly into semantic feature space without computationally expensive rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse embodiments and learning paradigms demonstrate GROVE's effectiveness, achieving 22.2% higher motion naturalness and 25.7% better task completion scores while training 8.4x faster than previous methods. These results establish a new foundation for scalable physical skill acquisition in simulated environments.

- **Summary**: With the growing sizes of AI models like large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers, deploying them on devices with limited computational resources is a significant challenge particularly when addressing domain generalisation (DG) tasks. This paper introduces a novel grouped structural pruning method for pre-trained vision transformers (ViT, BeiT, and DeiT), evaluated on the PACS and Office-Home DG benchmarks. Our method uses dependency graph analysis to identify and remove redundant groups of neurons, weights, filters, or attention heads within transformers, using a range of selection metrics. Grouped structural pruning is applied at pruning ratios of 50\%, 75\% and 95\% and the models are then fine-tuned on selected distributions from DG benchmarks to evaluate their overall performance in DG tasks. Results show significant improvements in inference speed and fine-tuning time with minimal trade-offs in accuracy and DG task performance. For instance, on the PACS benchmark, pruning ViT, BeiT, and DeiT models by 50\% using the Hessian metric resulted in accuracy drops of only -2.94\%, -1.42\%, and -1.72\%, respectively, while achieving speed boosts of 2.5x, 1.81x, and 2.15x. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in balancing model efficiency with domain generalisation performance.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have remarkably progressed in analyzing and understanding images. Despite these advancements, accurately regressing values in charts remains an underexplored area for MLLMs. For visualization, how do MLLMs perform when applied to graphical perception tasks? Our paper investigates this question by reproducing Cleveland and McGill's seminal 1984 experiment and comparing it against human task performance. Our study primarily evaluates fine-tuned and pretrained models and zero-shot prompting to determine if they closely match human graphical perception. Our findings highlight that MLLMs outperform human task performance in some cases but not in others. We highlight the results of all experiments to foster an understanding of where MLLMs succeed and fail when applied to data visualization.



### Resilience of Vision Transformers for Domain Generalisation in the Presence of Out-of-Distribution Noisy Images

- **Summary**: Modern AI models excel in controlled settings but often fail in real-world scenarios where data distributions shift unpredictably - a challenge known as domain generalisation (DG). This paper tackles this limitation by rigorously evaluating vision tramsformers, specifically the BEIT architecture which is a model pre-trained with masked image modelling (MIM), against synthetic out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks designed to mimic real-world noise and occlusions. We introduce a novel framework to generate OOD test cases by strategically masking object regions in images using grid patterns (25\%, 50\%, 75\% occlusion) and leveraging cutting-edge zero-shot segmentation via Segment Anything and Grounding DINO to ensure precise object localisation. Experiments across three benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet) demonstrate BEIT's known robustness while maintaining 94\% accuracy on PACS and 87\% on Office-Home, despite significant occlusions, outperforming CNNs and other vision transformers by margins of up to 37\%. Analysis of self-attention distances reveals that the BEIT dependence on global features correlates with its resilience. Furthermore, our synthetic benchmarks expose critical failure modes: performance degrades sharply when occlusions disrupt object shapes e.g. 68\% drop for external grid masking vs. 22\% for internal masking. This work provides two key advances (1) a scalable method to generate OOD benchmarks using controllable noise, and (2) empirical evidence that MIM and self-attention mechanism in vision transformers enhance DG by learning invariant features. These insights bridge the gap between lab-trained models and real-world deployment that offer a blueprint for building AI systems that generalise reliably under uncertainty.

- **Summary**: High dynamic range (HDR) imaging is vital for capturing the full range of light tones in scenes, essential for computer vision tasks such as autonomous driving. Standard commercial imaging systems face limitations in capacity for well depth, and quantization precision, hindering their HDR capabilities. Modulo imaging, based on unlimited sampling (US) theory, addresses these limitations by using a modulo analog-to-digital approach that resets signals upon saturation, enabling estimation of pixel resets through neighboring pixel intensities. Despite the effectiveness of (US) algorithms in one-dimensional signals, their optimization problem for two-dimensional signals remains unclear. This work formulates the US framework as an autoregressive $\ell_2$ phase unwrapping problem, providing computationally efficient solutions in the discrete cosine domain jointly with a stride removal algorithm also based on spatial differences. By leveraging higher-order finite differences for two-dimensional images, our approach enhances HDR image reconstruction from modulo images, demonstrating its efficacy in improving object detection in autonomous driving scenes without retraining.

- **Summary**: Loss functions are at the heart of deep learning, shaping how models learn and perform across diverse tasks. They are used to quantify the difference between predicted outputs and ground truth labels, guiding the optimization process to minimize errors. Selecting the right loss function is critical, as it directly impacts model convergence, generalization, and overall performance across various applications, from computer vision to time series forecasting. This paper presents a comprehensive review of loss functions, covering fundamental metrics like Mean Squared Error and Cross-Entropy to advanced functions such as Adversarial and Diffusion losses. We explore their mathematical foundations, impact on model training, and strategic selection for various applications, including computer vision (Discriminative and generative), tabular data prediction, and time series forecasting. For each of these categories, we discuss the most used loss functions in the recent advancements of deep learning techniques. Also, this review explore the historical evolution, computational efficiency, and ongoing challenges in loss function design, underlining the need for more adaptive and robust solutions. Emphasis is placed on complex scenarios involving multi-modal data, class imbalances, and real-world constraints. Finally, we identify key future directions, advocating for loss functions that enhance interpretability, scalability, and generalization, leading to more effective and resilient deep learning models.

- **Summary**: Personalized facial expression recognition (FER) involves adapting a machine learning model using samples from labeled sources and unlabeled target domains. Given the challenges of recognizing subtle expressions with considerable interpersonal variability, state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods focus on the multi-source UDA (MSDA) setting, where each domain corresponds to a specific subject, and improve model accuracy and robustness. However, when adapting to a specific target, the diverse nature of multiple source domains translates to a large shift between source and target data. State-of-the-art MSDA methods for FER address this domain shift by considering all the sources to adapt to the target representations. Nevertheless, adapting to a target subject presents significant challenges due to large distributional differences between source and target domains, often resulting in negative transfer. In addition, integrating all sources simultaneously increases computational costs and causes misalignment with the target. To address these issues, we propose a progressive MSDA approach that gradually introduces information from subjects based on their similarity to the target subject. This will ensure that only the most relevant sources from the target are selected, which helps avoid the negative transfer caused by dissimilar sources. We first exploit the closest sources to reduce the distribution shift with the target and then move towards the furthest while only considering the most relevant sources based on the predetermined threshold. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting caused by the incremental introduction of source subjects, we implemented a density-based memory mechanism that preserves the most relevant historical source samples for adaptation. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method on pain datasets: Biovid and UNBC-McMaster.

- **Summary**: Modeling high-frequency information is a critical challenge in scientific machine learning. For instance, fully turbulent flow simulations of Navier-Stokes equations at Reynolds numbers 3500 and above can generate high-frequency signals due to swirling fluid motions caused by eddies and vortices. Faithfully modeling such signals using neural networks depends on accurately reconstructing moderate to high frequencies. However, it has been well known that deep neural nets exhibit the so-called spectral bias toward learning low-frequency components. Meanwhile, Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as a popular class of data-driven models in recent years for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and for surrogate modeling in general. Although impressive results have been achieved on several PDE benchmark problems, FNOs often perform poorly in learning non-dominant frequencies characterized by local features. This limitation stems from the spectral bias inherent in neural networks and the explicit exclusion of high-frequency modes in FNOs and their variants. Therefore, to mitigate these issues and improve FNO's spectral learning capabilities to represent a broad range of frequency components, we propose two key architectural enhancements: (i) a parallel branch performing local spectral convolutions (ii) a high-frequency propagation module. Moreover, we propose a novel frequency-sensitive loss term based on radially binned spectral errors. This introduction of a parallel branch for local convolutions reduces number of trainable parameters by up to 50% while achieving the accuracy of baseline FNO that relies solely on global convolutions. Experiments on three challenging PDE problems in fluid mechanics and biological pattern formation, and the qualitative and spectral analysis of predictions show the effectiveness of our method over the state-of-the-art neural operator baselines.

- **Summary**: Information on standing dead trees is important for understanding forest ecosystem functioning and resilience but has been lacking over large geographic regions. Climate change has caused large-scale tree mortality events that can remain undetected due to limited data. In this study, we propose a novel method for segmenting standing dead trees using aerial multispectral orthoimages. Because access to annotated datasets has been a significant problem in forest remote sensing due to the need for forest expertise, we introduce a method for domain transfer by leveraging domain adaptation to learn a transformation from a source domain X to target domain Y. In this Image-to-Image translation task, we aim to utilize available annotations in the target domain by pre-training a segmentation network. When images from a new study site without annotations are introduced (source domain X), these images are transformed into the target domain. Then, transfer learning is applied by inferring the pre-trained network on domain-adapted images. In addition to investigating the feasibility of current domain adaptation approaches for this objective, we propose a novel approach called the Attention-guided Domain Adaptation Network (ADA-Net) with enhanced contrastive learning. Accordingly, the ADA-Net approach provides new state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance levels outperforming existing approaches. We have evaluated the proposed approach using two datasets from Finland and the US. The USA images are converted to the Finland domain, and we show that the synthetic USA2Finland dataset exhibits similar characteristics to the Finland domain images. The software implementation is shared at https://github.com/meteahishali/ADA-Net.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized neural rendering with its efficiency and quality, but like many novel view synthesis methods, it heavily depends on accurate camera poses from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems. Although recent SfM pipelines have made impressive progress, questions remain about how to further improve both their robust performance in challenging conditions (e.g., textureless scenes) and the precision of camera parameter estimation simultaneously. We present 3R-GS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges this gap by jointly optimizing 3D Gaussians and camera parameters from large reconstruction priors MASt3R-SfM. We note that naively performing joint 3D Gaussian and camera optimization faces two challenges: the sensitivity to the quality of SfM initialization, and its limited capacity for global optimization, leading to suboptimal reconstruction results. Our 3R-GS, overcomes these issues by incorporating optimized practices, enabling robust scene reconstruction even with imperfect camera registration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3R-GS delivers high-quality novel view synthesis and precise camera pose estimation while remaining computationally efficient.
