- **Summary**: High-dimensional image data often require dimensionality reduction before further analysis. This paper provides a purely analytical comparison of two linear techniques-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). After the derivation of each algorithm from first principles, we assess their interpretability, numerical stability, and suitability for differing matrix shapes. We synthesize rule-of-thumb guidelines for choosing one out of the two algorithms without empirical benchmarking, building on classical and recent numerical literature. Limitations and directions for future experimental work are outlined at the end.

- **Summary**: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has attracted widespread attention for its multimodal generalizable knowledge, which is significant for downstream tasks. However, the computational overhead of a large number of parameters and large-scale pre-training poses challenges of pre-training a different scale of CLIP. Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed as learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models with it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable knowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of utilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge, which inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework designed to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP. Specifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the multimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner. Subsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant models of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate MM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene approaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and comparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm (e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG requires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8 times pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient deployment across diverse downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Training data is at the core of any successful text-to-image models. The quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance. Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

- **Summary**: Stereo Depth estimation is a critical task in autonomous driving and robotics, where inaccuracies (such as misidentifying nearby objects as distant) can lead to dangerous situations. Adversarial attacks against stereo depth estimation can help reveal vulnerabilities before deployment. Previous work has shown that repeating optimized textures can effectively mislead stereo depth estimation in digital settings. However, our research reveals that these naively repeated texture structures perform poorly in physical-world implementations, i.e., when deployed as patches, limiting their practical utility for testing stereo depth estimation systems. In this work, for the first time, we discover that introducing regular intervals between repeated textures, creating a striped structure, significantly enhances the patch attack effectiveness. Through extensive experimentation, we analyze how variations of this novel structure influence the performance. Based on these insights, we develop a novel stereo depth attack that jointly optimizes both the striped structure and texture elements. Our generated adversarial patches can be inserted into any scenes and successfully attack state-of-the-art stereo depth estimation methods, i.e., RAFT-Stereo and STTR. Most critically, our patch can also attack commercial RGB-D cameras (Intel RealSense) in real-world conditions, demonstrating their practical relevance for security assessment of stereo systems.

- **Summary**: Despite the impressive advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), existing approaches suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: inefficient visual-language integration. Current methods either disrupt the model's inherent structure or introduce severe long-context computational burden, severely limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink multimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and efficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token concatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a lightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by injecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of layer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states based on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while preserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational costs. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also dramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs by 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half - establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time multimodal reasoning. The code and models will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Recent video action recognition methods have shown excellent performance by adapting large-scale pre-trained language-image models to the video domain. However, language models contain rich common sense priors - the scene contexts that humans use to constitute an understanding of objects, human-object interactions, and activities - that have not been fully exploited. In this paper, we introduce a framework incorporating language-driven common sense priors to identify cluttered video action sequences from monocular views that are often heavily occluded. We propose: (1) A video context summary component that generates candidate objects, activities, and the interactions between objects and activities; (2) A description generation module that describes the current scene given the context and infers subsequent activities, through auxiliary prompts and common sense reasoning; (3) A multi-modal activity recognition head that combines visual and textual cues to recognize video actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging Action Genome and Charades datasets.

- **Summary**: While existing Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) models have achieved significant success, their performance with limited labeled samples and a small number of known categories remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming to achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known information scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed to learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these boundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary pre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on known category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries using labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided decision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further enhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved pseudo-labeled samples. Then, these refined boundaries are applied to unknown clusters via guidance from affinity-based feature retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on six public GCD benchmarks under the FSGCD setting.

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) aims to combine complementary information from both image modalities, producing more informative and comprehensive outputs. Recently, text-guided IVF has shown great potential due to its flexibility and versatility. However, the effective integration and utilization of textual semantic information remains insufficiently studied. To tackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask semantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual descriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on this, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image fusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is optimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. Specifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information Generator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven Attentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics based on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based fusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask semantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated attention driven by text semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach, particularly in terms of performance on downstream tasks, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used to assess metabolic activity, but its application is limited by the availability of radiotracers. 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most commonly used tracer but shows limited effectiveness for certain tumors. In contrast, 6-18F-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) offers higher specificity for neuroendocrine tumors and neurological disorders. However, the complexity of its synthesis process and constraints on transportation time have limited its clinical application. Among different forms of raw data acquired by the scanner, sinogram is a commonly used representation in PET imaging. Therefore, modeling in projection domain enables more direct utilization of the original information, potentially reducing the accumulation errors during the image reconstruction process. Inspired by these factors, this study proposes a prior-guided joint diffusion model (PJDM) for transforming 18F-FDG PET sinograms into 18F-DOPA PET sinograms. During inference, an initial synthetic 18F-DOPA PET sinogram is first generated using a higher-order hybrid sampler. This sinogram is then degraded and serves as an additional condition to guide the iterative refinement process. Experimental results demonstrated that PJDM effectively improved both sinogram quality and the final synthetic outcomes. The code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/PJDM.



### 3DeepRep: 3D Deep Low-rank Tensor Representation for Hyperspectral Image Inpainting

- **Summary**: Recent approaches based on transform-based tensor nuclear norm (TNN) have demonstrated notable effectiveness in hyperspectral image (HSI) inpainting by leveraging low-rank structures in latent representations. Recent developments incorporate deep transforms to improve low-rank tensor representation; however, existing approaches typically restrict the transform to the spectral mode, neglecting low-rank properties along other tensor modes. In this paper, we propose a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation (3DeepRep) model, which performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three modes of the HSI tensor. To enforce low-rankness, the model minimizes the nuclear norms of mode-i frontal slices in the corresponding latent space for each direction (i=1,2,3), forming a 3-directional TNN regularization. The outputs from the three directional branches are subsequently fused via a learnable aggregation module to produce the final result. An efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm is developed to solve the model in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments on real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior inpainting performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object detection plays a vital role in applications such as environmental monitoring and urban security. To improve robustness, recent studies have explored multimodal detection by fusing visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) imagery. However, due to UAV platform motion and asynchronous imaging, spatial misalignment frequently occurs between modalities, leading to weak alignment. This introduces two major challenges: semantic inconsistency at corresponding spatial locations and modality conflict during feature fusion. Existing methods often address these issues in isolation, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal Offset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion (CoDAF), a unified framework that jointly tackles both challenges in weakly aligned UAV-based object detection. CoDAF comprises two novel modules: the Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA), which estimates attention-based spatial offsets and uses deformable convolution guided by a shared semantic space to align features more precisely; and the Dynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM), which adaptively balances modality contributions through gating and refines fused features via spatial-channel dual attention. By integrating alignment and fusion in a unified design, CoDAF enables robust UAV object detection. Experiments on standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, with CoDAF achieving a mAP of 78.6% on the DroneVehicle dataset.

- **Summary**: In medical imaging, AI decision-support systems must balance accuracy and interpretability to build user trust and support effective clinical decision-making. Recently, Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) and its variants have emerged as interpretable-by-design modeling techniques, aiming to explain AI decisions in terms of human-understandable, clinically relevant concepts. However, existing V-IP methods overlook instance-level uncertainties in query-answer generation, which can arise from model limitations (epistemic uncertainty) or variability in expert responses (aleatoric uncertainty).   This paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware V-IP (UAV-IP), a novel framework that integrates uncertainty quantification into the V-IP process. We evaluate UAV-IP across four medical imaging datasets, PH2, Derm7pt, BrEaST, and SkinCon, demonstrating an average AUC improvement of approximately 3.2% while generating 20% more concise explanations compared to baseline V-IP, without sacrificing informativeness. These findings highlight the importance of uncertainty-aware reasoning in interpretable by design models for robust and reliable medical decision-making.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of image generation technologies, especially the advancement of Diffusion Models, the quality of synthesized images has significantly improved, raising concerns among researchers about information security. To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models, diffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective countermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images. Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention (NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer, forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images. When encountering unseen generation methods, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance.Our code is available at https://github.com/WeinanGuan/NASA-Swin.

- **Summary**: Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of effective instance level feature representation. Supervised or weakly supervised object detection methods are not among the options due to their poor performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance level region discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of feature subsets. The non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the various instance regions in an image of different semantic scales. The hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and occlusions, which are widely observed in the real scenarios. The features derived from the nodes on the hierarchy make up a comprehensive representation for the latent instances in the image. Our instance-level descriptor remains effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Empirical studies on three instance search benchmarks show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods considerably.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across multimodal tasks, yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass built-in safety mechanisms to elicit restricted content generation. Existing black-box jailbreak methods primarily rely on adversarial textual prompts or image perturbations, yet these approaches are highly detectable by standard content filtering systems and exhibit low query and computational efficiency. In this work, we present Cross-modal Adversarial Multimodal Obfuscation (CAMO), a novel black-box jailbreak attack framework that decomposes malicious prompts into semantically benign visual and textual fragments. By leveraging LVLMs' cross-modal reasoning abilities, CAMO covertly reconstructs harmful instructions through multi-step reasoning, evading conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach supports adjustable reasoning complexity and requires significantly fewer queries than prior attacks, enabling both stealth and efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on leading LVLMs validate CAMO's effectiveness, showcasing robust performance and strong cross-model transferability. These results underscore significant vulnerabilities in current built-in safety mechanisms, emphasizing an urgent need for advanced, alignment-aware security and safety solutions in vision-language systems.

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible light image fusion aims to combine the strengths of both modalities to generate images that are rich in information and fulfill visual or computational requirements. This paper proposes an image fusion method based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs, and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics, producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich information without the necessity for a training dataset.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models excel in image generation but are computational and resource-intensive due to their reliance on iterative Markov chain processes, leading to error accumulation and limiting the effectiveness of naive compression techniques. In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets, outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in medical image segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis. In particular, numerous advanced methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans. While recent studies in other medical imaging domains have revealed that integrating textual reports with visual data can enhance segmentation accuracy, the field of brain tumor analysis lacks a comprehensive dataset that combines radiological images with corresponding textual annotations. This limitation has hindered the exploration of multimodal approaches that leverage both imaging and textual data.   To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the TextBraTS dataset, the first publicly available volume-level multimodal dataset that contains paired MRI volumes and rich textual annotations, derived from the widely adopted BraTS2020 benchmark. Building upon this novel dataset, we propose a novel baseline framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric medical image segmentation. Through extensive experiments with various text-image fusion strategies and templated text formulations, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy, offering valuable insights into effective multimodal integration techniques.   Our dataset, implementation code, and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/Jupitern52/TextBraTS.

- **Summary**: Real-World Image Super-Resolution is one of the most challenging task in image restoration. However, existing methods struggle with an accurate understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe degradation.

- **Summary**: Synthetic video generation is progressing very rapidly. The latest models can produce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually indistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors have been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which limits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to overcome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really matters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on identifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative architecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize a specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative architectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are unbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a novel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet decomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model to exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves the generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for complex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic generators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a single generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of other models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent results even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX. Code and data will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Infrared thermography faces persistent challenges in temperature accuracy due to material emissivity variations, where existing methods often neglect the joint optimization of radiometric calibration and image degradation. This study introduces a physically guided neural framework that unifies temperature correction and image enhancement through a symmetric skip-CNN architecture and an emissivity-aware attention module. The pre-processing stage segments the ROIs of the image and and initially corrected the firing rate. A novel dual-constrained loss function strengthens the statistical consistency between the target and reference regions through mean-variance alignment and histogram matching based on Kullback-Leibler dispersion. The method works by dynamically fusing thermal radiation features and spatial context, and the model suppresses emissivity artifacts while recovering structural details. After validating the industrial blower system under different conditions, the improved network realizes the dynamic fusion of thermal radiation characteristics and spatial background, with accurate calibration results in various industrial conditions.

- **Summary**: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize co-visibility-the 3D regions simultaneously visible in multiple images-even when these images are sparsely distributed across a complex scene. This ability is foundational to 3D vision, robotic perception, and relies not only on low-level feature matching but also on high-level spatial reasoning and cognitive integration. Yet, it remains unclear whether current vision models can replicate this human-level proficiency. In this work, we introduce the Co-VisiON benchmark, designed to evaluate human-inspired co-visibility reasoning across more than 1,000 sparse-view indoor scenarios. Our results show that while co-visibility is often approached as a low-level feature-matching task, it remains challenging for existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary vision-language model surpasses all vision-only baselines, but all models fall significantly short of human performance. This gap underscores the limitations of current architectures and motivates the need for models that integrate spatial and semantic information in a human-like manner. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of robust, cognitively inspired reasoning in challenging, sparse environments.

- **Summary**: Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding, referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception and generative capabilities.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of generative models has raised serious concerns about visual content forgery. Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to supervise the segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the DDL dataset demonstrate that Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing the first place in the IJCAI 2025 Deepfake Detection and Localization Challenge with an overall score of 0.846. Our results validate the effectiveness of the proposed patch-level fusion and conditional query design in improving both classification accuracy and spatial localization under diverse forgery patterns.

- **Summary**: Robust and accurate ball detection is a critical component for autonomous humanoid soccer robots, particularly in dynamic and challenging environments such as RoboCup outdoor fields. However, traditional supervised approaches require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks -- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting faster convergence.

- **Summary**: Off-road traversability segmentation enables autonomous navigation with applications in search-and-rescue, military operations, wildlife exploration, and agriculture. Current frameworks struggle due to significant variations in unstructured environments and uncertain scene changes, and are not adaptive to be used for different robot types. We present AnyTraverse, a framework combining natural language-based prompts with human-operator assistance to determine navigable regions for diverse robotic vehicles. The system segments scenes for a given set of prompts and calls the operator only when encountering previously unexplored scenery or unknown class not part of the prompt in its region-of-interest, thus reducing active supervision load while adapting to varying outdoor scenes. Our zero-shot learning approach eliminates the need for extensive data collection or retraining. Our experimental validation includes testing on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets and demonstrate real-world deployment on multiple robot platforms. The results show that AnyTraverse performs better than GA-NAV and Off-seg while offering a vehicle-agnostic approach to off-road traversability that balances automation with targeted human supervision.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet, Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.

- **Summary**: Camera calibration using planar targets has been widely favored, and two types of control points have been mainly considered as measurements: the corners of the checkerboard and the centroid of circles. Since a centroid is derived from numerous pixels, the circular pattern provides more precise measurements than the checkerboard. However, the existing projection model of circle centroids is biased under lens distortion, resulting in low performance. To surmount this limitation, we propose an unbiased projection model of the circular pattern and demonstrate its superior accuracy compared to the checkerboard. Complementing this, we introduce uncertainty into circular patterns to enhance calibration robustness and completeness. Defining centroid uncertainty improves the performance of calibration components, including pattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics. We also provide guidelines for performing good camera calibration based on the evaluation metric. The core concept of this approach is to model the boundary points of a two-dimensional shape as a Markov random field, considering its connectivity. The shape distribution is propagated to the centroid uncertainty through an appropriate shape representation based on the Green theorem. Consequently, the resulting framework achieves marked gains in calibration accuracy and robustness.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based multi-condition controllable framework for video head swapping, which seamlessly transplant a human head from a static image into a dynamic video, while preserving the original body and background of target video, and further allowing to tweak head expressions and movements during swapping as needed. Existing face-swapping methods mainly focus on localized facial replacement neglecting holistic head morphology, while head-swapping approaches struggling with hairstyle diversity and complex backgrounds, and none of these methods allow users to modify the transplanted head expressions after swapping. To tackle these challenges, our method incorporates several innovative strategies through a unified latent diffusion paradigm. 1) Identity-preserving context fusion: We propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy to explicitly disentangle foreground head identity features from background/body contexts, combining hair enhancement strategy to achieve robust holistic head identity preservation across diverse hair types and complex backgrounds. 2) Expression-aware landmark retargeting and editing: We propose a disentangled 3DMM-driven retargeting module that decouples identity, expression, and head poses, minimizing the impact of original expressions in input images and supporting expression editing. While a scale-aware retargeting strategy is further employed to minimize cross-identity expression distortion for higher transfer precision. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in seamless background integration while preserving the identity of the source portrait, as well as showcasing superior expression transfer capabilities applicable to both real and virtual characters.

- **Summary**: Autonomous parking plays a vital role in intelligent vehicle systems, particularly in constrained urban environments where high-precision control is required. While traditional rule-based parking systems struggle with environmental uncertainties and lack adaptability in crowded or dynamic scenes, human drivers demonstrate the ability to park intuitively without explicit modeling. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Transformer-based end-to-end framework for autonomous parking that learns from expert demonstrations. The network takes as input surround-view camera images, goal-point representations, ego vehicle motion, and pedestrian trajectories. It outputs discrete control sequences including throttle, braking, steering, and gear selection. A novel cross-attention module integrates BEV features with target points, and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor enhances safety by modeling dynamic obstacles. We validate our method on the CARLA 0.9.14 simulator in both vertical and parallel parking scenarios. Experiments show our model achieves a high success rate of 96.57\%, with average positional and orientation errors of 0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively. The ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of key modules such as pedestrian prediction and goal-point attention fusion. The code and dataset will be released at: https://github.com/little-snail-f/ParkFormer.

- **Summary**: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution (SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content reconstruction.

- **Summary**: The detection and localization of quality-related problems in industrially mass-produced products has historically relied on manual inspection, which is costly and error-prone. Machine learning has the potential to replace manual handling. As such, the desire is to facilitate an unsupervised (or self-supervised) approach, as it is often impossible to specify all conceivable defects ahead of time. A plethora of prior works have demonstrated the aptitude of common reconstruction-, embedding-, and synthesis-based methods in laboratory settings. However, in practice, we observe that most methods do not handle low data quality well or exude low robustness in unfavorable, but typical real-world settings. For practitioners it may be very difficult to identify the actual underlying problem when such methods underperform. Worse, often-reported metrics (e.g., AUROC) are rarely suitable in practice and may give misleading results. In our setting, we attempt to identify subtle anomalies on the surface of blasted forged metal parts, using rather low-quality RGB imagery only, which is a common industrial setting. We specifically evaluate two types of state-of-the-art models that allow us to identify and improve quality issues in production data, without having to obtain new data. Our contribution is to provide guardrails for practitioners that allow them to identify problems related to, e.g., (lack of) robustness or invariance, in either the chosen model or the data reliably in similar scenarios. Furthermore, we exemplify common pitfalls in and shortcomings of likelihood-based approaches and outline a framework for proper empirical risk estimation that is more suitable for real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than $1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally, we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for resource-constrained domains.

- **Summary**: Image generation models are revolutionizing many domains, and urban analysis and design is no exception. While such models are widely adopted, there is a limited literature exploring their geographic knowledge, along with the biases they embed. In this work, we generated 150 synthetic images for each state in the USA and related capitals using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, two state-of-the-art models for image generation. We embed each image using DINO-v2 ViT-S/14 and the Fr\'echet Inception Distances to measure the similarity between the generated images. We found that while these models have implicitly learned aspects of USA geography, if we prompt the models to generate an image for "United States" instead of specific cities or states, the models exhibit a strong representative bias toward metropolis-like areas, excluding rural states and smaller cities. {\color{black} In addition, we found that models systematically exhibit some entity-disambiguation issues with European-sounding names like Frankfort or Devon.

- **Summary**: This work investigates the use of multimodal biometrics to detect distractions caused by smartphone use during tasks that require sustained attention, with a focus on computer-based online learning. Although the methods are applicable to various domains, such as autonomous driving, we concentrate on the challenges learners face in maintaining engagement amid internal (e.g., motivation), system-related (e.g., course design) and contextual (e.g., smartphone use) factors. Traditional learning platforms often lack detailed behavioral data, but Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) and biosensors provide new insights into learner attention. We propose an AI-based approach that leverages physiological signals and head pose data to detect phone use. Our results show that single biometric signals, such as brain waves or heart rate, offer limited accuracy, while head pose alone achieves 87%. A multimodal model combining all signals reaches 91% accuracy, highlighting the benefits of integration. We conclude by discussing the implications and limitations of deploying these models for real-time support in online learning environments.

- **Summary**: In clinical practice, single-radiotracer positron emission tomography (PET) is commonly used for imaging. Although multi-tracer PET imaging can provide supplementary information of radiotracers that are sensitive to physiological function changes, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of physiological and pathological states, the gamma-photon pairs generated by positron annihilation reactions of different tracers in PET imaging have the same energy, making it difficult to distinguish the tracer signals. In this study, a multi-latent space guided texture conditional diffusion transformer model (MS-CDT) is proposed for PET tracer separation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use texture condition and multi-latent space for tracer separation in PET imaging. The proposed model integrates diffusion and transformer architectures into a unified optimization framework, with the novel addition of texture masks as conditional inputs to enhance image details. By leveraging multi-latent space prior derived from different tracers, the model captures multi-level feature representations, aiming to balance computational efficiency and detail preservation. The texture masks, serving as conditional guidance, help the model focus on salient structural patterns, thereby improving the extraction and utilization of fine-grained image textures. When combined with the diffusion transformer backbone, this conditioning mechanism contributes to more accurate and robust tracer separation. To evaluate its effectiveness, the proposed MS-CDT is compared with several advanced methods on two types of 3D PET datasets: brain and chest scans. Experimental results indicate that MS-CDT achieved competitive performance in terms of image quality and preservation of clinically relevant information.

- **Summary**: Global localization is necessary for autonomous operations on the lunar surface where traditional Earth-based navigation infrastructure, such as GPS, is unavailable. As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain, which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a previous session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables accurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings. LunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization experiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global localization. To encourage the development of further methods for global localization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback module: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models, including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best human observers.

- **Summary**: Image restoration tasks like deblurring, denoising, and dehazing usually need distinct models for each degradation type, restricting their generalization in real-world scenarios with mixed or unknown degradations. In this work, we propose \textbf{Defusion}, a novel all-in-one image restoration framework that utilizes visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion. Unlike existing methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors, Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world degradations.

- **Summary**: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded low-quality (LQ) ones by reversing the effects of degradation. Existing generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation, which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow, a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks, offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The segmentation of forest LiDAR 3D point clouds, including both individual tree and semantic segmentation, is fundamental for advancing forest management and ecological research. However, current approaches often struggle with the complexity and variability of natural forest environments. We present ForestFormer3D, a new unified and end-to-end framework designed for precise individual tree and semantic segmentation. ForestFormer3D incorporates ISA-guided query point selection, a score-based block merging strategy during inference, and a one-to-many association mechanism for effective training. By combining these new components, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for individual tree segmentation on the newly introduced FOR-instanceV2 dataset, which spans diverse forest types and regions. Additionally, ForestFormer3D generalizes well to unseen test sets (Wytham woods and LAUTx), showcasing its robustness across different forest conditions and sensor modalities.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a critical challenge in real-world vision systems, especially in resource-constrained environments like drones, where memory and computation are limited. Existing prompt-driven UDA methods typically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to source-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this work, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by prompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and fine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A small set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain semantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven Instance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to briefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher then generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly adaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset demonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x faster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and scalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.

- **Summary**: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an emerging perception paradigm in autonomous driving, providing a voxel-level representation of both geometric details and semantic categories. However, the perception capability of a single vehicle is inherently constrained by occlusion, restricted sensor range, and narrow viewpoints. To address these limitations, collaborative perception enables the exchange of complementary information, thereby enhancing the completeness and accuracy. In the absence of a dedicated dataset for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction, we augment an existing collaborative perception dataset by replaying it in CARLA with a high-resolution semantic voxel sensor to provide dense and comprehensive occupancy annotations. In addition, we establish benchmarks with varying prediction ranges designed to systematically assess the impact of spatial extent on collaborative prediction. We further develop a baseline model that performs inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline model consistently outperforms single-agent models, with increasing gains observed as the prediction range expands.



### Unsupervised Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction Based on Real-World Degradation Patterns

- **Summary**: The training of real-world super-resolution reconstruction models heavily relies on datasets that reflect real-world degradation patterns. Extracting and modeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only real-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When synthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on degradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise characteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit degradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone cannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the significant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two strategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing the domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs domain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and learn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real data generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR images. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while maintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts. The proposed framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns from LR observations and synthesizes aligned datasets with corresponding degradation characteristics, thereby enabling the trained network to achieve superior performance in reconstructing high-quality SR images from real-world LR inputs.

- **Summary**: Uncovering which features' combinations high-level visual units encode is critical to understand how images are transformed into representations that support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS), an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization: pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively. Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.

- **Summary**: Effective license plate recognition systems are required to be resilient to constant change, as new license plates are released into traffic daily. While Transformer-based networks excel in their recognition at first sight, we observe significant performance drop over time which proves them unsuitable for tense production environments. Indeed, such systems obtain state-of-the-art results on plates whose syntax is seen during training. Yet, we show they perform similarly to random guessing on future plates where legible characters are wrongly recognized due to a shift in their syntax. After highlighting the flows of positional and contextual information in Transformer encoder-decoders, we identify several causes for their over-reliance on past syntax. Following, we devise architectural cut-offs and replacements which we integrate into SaLT, an attempt at a Syntax-Less Transformer for syntax-agnostic modeling of license plate representations. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show that our approach reaches top accuracy on past syntax and most importantly nearly maintains performance on future license plates. We further demonstrate the robustness of our architecture enhancements by way of various ablations.

- **Summary**: We present Assembler, a scalable and generalizable framework for 3D part assembly that reconstructs complete objects from input part meshes and a reference image. Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data. First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for interactive and compositional design.

- **Summary**: Due to the presence of political echo chambers, it becomes imperative to detect and remove subjective bias and emotionally charged language from both the text and images of political articles. However, prior work has focused on solely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image portions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium to communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that leverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps. Image Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their bias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias score of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting biased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three steps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and the image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by comparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is promising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many potential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective training. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time, particularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results. A human evaluation portion was also proposed to ensure semantic consistency of the newly generated text and images.

- **Summary**: Driving scene identification, which assigns multiple non-exclusive class labels to a scene, provides the contextual awareness necessary for enhancing autonomous vehicles' ability to understand, reason about, and interact with the complex driving environment. As a multi-label classification problem, it is better tackled via multitasking learning. However, directly training a multi-label classification model for driving scene identification through multitask learning presents two main challenges: acquiring a balanced, comprehensively annotated multi-label dataset and balancing learning across different tasks. This paper introduces a novel learning system that synergizes knowledge acquisition and accumulation (KAA) with consistency-based active learning (CAL) to address those challenges. KAA acquires and accumulates knowledge about scene identification from various single-label datasets via monotask learning. Subsequently, CAL effectively resolves the knowledge gap caused by the discrepancy between single-label and multi-label data. An ablation study on our Driving Scene Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% performance increase over the baseline model pretrained on ImageNet. Of this, KAA accounts for 31.3% of the gain, and CAL contributes 24.8%. Moreover, KAA-CAL stands out as the best performer when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-label models on two public datasets, BDD100K and HSD, achieving this while using 85% less data. The DSI dataset and the implementation code for KAA-CAL are available at https://github.com/KELISBU/KAA-CAL .

- **Summary**: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision, which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras), and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

- **Summary**: We introduce a robust framework, RGBTrack, for real-time 6D pose estimation and tracking that operates solely on RGB data, thereby eliminating the need for depth input for such dynamic and precise object pose tracking tasks. Building on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions, RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition, RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality, and computer vision.   The source code for our implementation will be made publicly available at https://github.com/GreatenAnoymous/RGBTrack.git.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to detect and diagnose medical conditions using medical imaging. Despite their utility, these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, which can affect diagnostic reliability and undermine trust among healthcare professionals. In this study, we propose a robust training algorithm with data augmentation (RTDA) to mitigate these vulnerabilities in medical image classification. We benchmark classifier robustness against adversarial perturbations and natural variations of RTDA and six competing baseline techniques, including adversarial training and data augmentation approaches in isolation and combination, using experimental data sets with three different imaging technologies (mammograms, X-rays, and ultrasound). We demonstrate that RTDA achieves superior robustness against adversarial attacks and improved generalization performance in the presence of distribution shift in each image classification task while maintaining high clean accuracy.

- **Summary**: Digital image watermarks as a security feature can be derived from the imager's physically unclonable functions (PUFs) by utilizing the manufacturing variations, i.e., the dark signal non-uniformity (DSNU). While a few demonstrations focused on the CMOS image sensors (CIS) and active pixel sensors (APS), single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) imagers have never been investigated for this purpose. In this work, we have proposed a novel watermarking technique using perimeter gated SPAD (pgSPAD) imagers. We utilized the DSNU of three 64 x 64 pgSPAD imager chips, fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m standard CMOS process and analyzed the simulated watermarks for standard test images from publicly available database. Our observation shows that both source identification and tamper detection can be achieved using the proposed source-scene-specific dynamic watermarks with a controllable sensitivity-robustness trade-off.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning addresses the issue of limited annotations in medical images effectively, but its performance is often inadequate for complex backgrounds and challenging tasks. Multi-modal fusion methods can significantly improve the accuracy of medical image segmentation by providing complementary information. However, they face challenges in achieving significant improvements under semi-supervised conditions due to the challenge of effectively leveraging unlabeled data. There is a significant need to create an effective and reliable multi-modal learning strategy for leveraging unlabeled data in semi-supervised segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach, which leverages complementary multi-modal information to enhance performance with limited labeled data. Our approach employs a multi-stage multi-modal fusion and enhancement strategy to fully utilize complementary multi-modal information, while reducing feature discrepancies and enhancing feature sharing and alignment. Furthermore, we effectively introduce contrastive mutual learning to constrain prediction consistency across modalities, thereby facilitating the robustness of segmentation results in semi-supervised tasks. Experimental results on two multi-modal datasets demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of the proposed framework, establishing its valuable potential for solving medical image segmentation tasks in complex scenarios.

- **Summary**: Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets (e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have made significant advances in histological prediction tasks in recent years. However, for adaptation in clinical practice, their lack of robustness to varying conditions such as staining, scanner, hospital, and demographics is still a limiting factor: if trained on overrepresented subpopulations, models regularly struggle with less frequent patterns, leading to shortcut learning and biased predictions. Large-scale foundation models have not fully eliminated this issue. Therefore, we propose a novel approach explicitly modeling such metadata into a Metadata-guided generative Diffusion model framework (MeDi). MeDi allows for a targeted augmentation of underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, which balances limited training data and mitigates biases in downstream models. We experimentally show that MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for unseen subpopulations in TCGA, boosts the overall fidelity of the generated images, and enables improvements in performance for downstream classifiers on datasets with subpopulation shifts. Our work is a proof-of-concept towards better mitigating data biases with generative models.

- **Summary**: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights, contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions, generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional video-based methods for action spotting.

- **Summary**: Medical image analysis is critical yet challenged by the need of jointly segmenting organs or tissues, and numerous instances for anatomical structures and tumor microenvironment analysis. Existing studies typically formulated different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances.

- **Summary**: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures, material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts, engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB) patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned, lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2% recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing interpretation.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown potential in expanding limited medical imaging datasets. This study explores how different ratios of GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN. The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching 95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined. This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases.

- **Summary**: There now exists many popular object detectors based on deep learning that can analyze images and extract locations and class labels for occurrences of objects. For image time series (i.e., video or sequences of stills), tracking objects over time and preserving object identity can help to improve object detection performance, and is necessary for many downstream tasks, including classifying and predicting behaviors, and estimating total abundances. Here we present yasmot, a lightweight and flexible object tracker that can process the output from popular object detectors and track objects over time from either monoscopic or stereoscopic camera configurations. In addition, it includes functionality to generate consensus detections from ensembles of object detectors.

- **Summary**: Emotion recognition from facial images is a crucial task in human-computer interaction, enabling machines to learn human emotions through facial expressions. Previous studies have shown that facial images can be used to train deep learning models; however, most of these studies do not include a through dataset analysis. Visualizing facial landmarks can be challenging when extracting meaningful dataset insights; to address this issue, we propose facial landmark box plots, a visualization technique designed to identify outliers in facial datasets. Additionally, we compare two sets of facial landmark features: (i) the landmarks' absolute positions and (ii) their displacements from a neutral expression to the peak of an emotional expression. Our results indicate that a neural network achieves better performance than a random forest classifier.

Among them, generative models have emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling the efficient creation of diverse and physically plausible demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce Dex1B, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality demonstration dataset produced with generative models. The dataset contains one billion demonstrations for two fundamental tasks: grasping and articulation. To construct it, we propose a generative model that integrates geometric constraints to improve feasibility and applies additional conditions to enhance diversity. We validate the model on both established and newly introduced simulation benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness through real-world robot experiments. Our project page is at https://jianglongye.com/dex1b

- **Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games, ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of interactive game video generation.

- **Summary**: Unified image understanding and generation has emerged as a promising paradigm in multimodal artificial intelligence. Despite recent progress, the optimal architectural design for such unified models remains an open challenge. In this work, we start by analyzing the modality alignment behaviors of task-specific expert models for understanding and generation, as well as current unified models. Our analysis reveals a crucial observation: understanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment across network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better comprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality alignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to recover spatial details. These divergent alignment patterns create a fundamental conflict in fully shared Transformer backbones, where a uniform representational flow often leads to performance compromises across two tasks. Motivated by this finding, we introduce UniFork, a novel Y-shaped architecture that shares the shallow layers for cross-task representation learning, while employing task-specific branches in deeper layers to avoid task interference. This design effectively balances shared learning and task specialization. Through extensive ablation experiments, we demonstrate that Unifork consistently outperforms conventional fully shared Transformer architectures, and achieves performance on par with or better than task-specific models.

- **Summary**: 3D panorama synthesis is a promising yet challenging task that demands high-quality and diverse visual appearance and geometry of the generated omnidirectional content. Existing methods leverage rich image priors from pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design, we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D scene generation.

Leveraging the CoppeliaSim simulation environment and its Python API, we integrate time-of-flight LiDAR, image sensors, and two dimensional scanners onto a simulated vehicle platform operating within an urban scenario. The workflow automates data capture, storage, and annotation across multiple formats (PCD, PLY, CSV), producing synchronized multimodal datasets with ground truth pose information. We validate the pipeline by generating large-scale point clouds and corresponding RGB and depth imagery. The study examines potential security vulnerabilities in LiDAR data, such as adversarial point injection and spoofing attacks, and demonstrates how synthetic datasets can facilitate the evaluation of defense strategies. Finally, limitations related to environmental realism, sensor noise modeling, and computational scalability are discussed, and future research directions, such as incorporating weather effects, real-world terrain models, and advanced scanner configurations, are proposed. The workflow provides a versatile, reproducible framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic LiDAR datasets to advance perception research and strengthen sensor security in autonomous systems. Documentation and examples accompany this framework; samples of animated cloud returns and image sensor data can be found at this Link.

- **Summary**: Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their structure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods. In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling articulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints, including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable parts.

- **Summary**: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be released at https://orangesodahub.github.io/InfGen

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in video diffusion models based on Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in generating temporally coherent videos. Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models. Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language instructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven post-training.

- **Summary**: Automating embryo viability prediction for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is important but challenging due to the limited availability of labeled pregnancy outcome data, as only a small fraction of embryos are labeled after transfer. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to improve prediction. However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly applicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo time-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory for conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and many outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle with semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to address these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In each stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing memory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame alignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each video and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then models relationships between video embeddings. Our method efficiently handles long videos and temporal variability. On 23,027 time-lapse videos (3,286 labeled), STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 (95% CI: 0.632-0.638) compared to baselines, with limited computational resources.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide and is typically detected via screening programs where healthy people are invited in regular intervals. Automated risk prediction approaches have the potential to improve this process by facilitating dynamically screening of high-risk groups. While most models focus solely on the most recent screening, there is growing interest in exploiting temporal information to capture evolving trends in breast tissue, as inspired by clinical practice. Early methods typically relied on two time steps, and although recent efforts have extended this to multiple time steps using Transformer architectures, challenges remain in fully harnessing the rich temporal dynamics inherent in longitudinal imaging data. In this work, we propose to instead leverage Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with a state-space model (SSM) and LSTM-like memory mechanisms to effectively capture nuanced trends in breast tissue evolution. To further enhance our approach, we incorporate an asymmetry module that utilizes a Spatial Asymmetry Detector (SAD) and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker (LAT) to identify clinically relevant bilateral differences. This integrated framework demonstrates notable improvements in predicting cancer onset, especially for the more challenging high-density breast cases and achieves superior performance at extended time points (years four and five), highlighting its potential to advance early breast cancer recognition and enable more personalized screening strategies.

- **Summary**: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using only a few X-ray projection views enables faster scans with lower radiation dose, but the resulting severe under-sampling causes strong artifacts and poor spatial coverage. We address these challenges in a unified framework. First, we replace conventional UNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model. Convolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance global context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features, querying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight attenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior baselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views. Second, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric coherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest neighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT, provides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM. Experiments on LUNA16 and ToothFairy show consistent gains from six to ten views, validating the effectiveness of combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based geometry reasoning for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the rapid growth of the Internet of Things technologies and the widespread adoption of 5G wireless networks have led to an exponential increase in the number of radiation devices operating in complex electromagnetic environments. A key challenge in managing and securing these devices is accurate identification and classification. To address this challenge, specific emitter identification techniques have emerged as a promising solution that aims to provide reliable and efficient means of identifying individual radiation devices in a unified and standardized manner. This research proposes an approach that leverages transient energy spectrum analysis using the General Linear Chirplet Transform to extract features from RF devices. A dataset comprising nine RF devices is utilized, with each sample containing 900 attributes and a total of 1080 equally distributed samples across the devices. These features are then used in a classification modeling framework. To overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning methods, we introduce a hybrid deep learning model called the CNN-Bi-GRU for learning the identification of RF devices based on their transient characteristics. The proposed approach provided a 10-fold cross-validation performance with a precision of 99.33%, recall of 99.53%, F1-score of 99.43%, and classification accuracy of 99.17%. The results demonstrate the promising classification performance of the CNN-Bi-GRU approach, indicating its suitability for accurately identifying RF devices based on their transient characteristics and its potential for enhancing device identification and classification in complex wireless environments.

- **Summary**: We present BlenderFusion, a generative visual compositing framework that synthesizes new scenes by recomposing objects, camera, and background. It follows a layering-editing-compositing pipeline: (i) segmenting and converting visual inputs into editable 3D entities (layering), (ii) editing them in Blender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a coherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative compositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original (source) and edited (target) scenes in parallel. It is fine-tuned on video frames with two key training strategies: (i) source masking, enabling flexible modifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering, facilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion significantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing tasks.

- **Summary**: Robust visual recognition in underwater environments remains a significant challenge due to complex distortions such as turbidity, low illumination, and occlusion, which severely degrade the performance of standard vision systems. This paper introduces AQUA20, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising 8,171 underwater images across 20 marine species reflecting real-world environmental challenges such as illumination, turbidity, occlusions, etc., providing a valuable resource for underwater visual understanding. Thirteen state-of-the-art deep learning models, including lightweight CNNs (SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2) and transformer-based architectures (ViT, ConvNeXt), were evaluated to benchmark their performance in classifying marine species under challenging conditions. Our experimental results show ConvNeXt achieving the best performance, with a Top-3 accuracy of 98.82% and a Top-1 accuracy of 90.69%, as well as the highest overall F1-score of 88.92% with moderately large parameter size. The results obtained from our other benchmark models also demonstrate trade-offs between complexity and performance. We also provide an extensive explainability analysis using GRAD-CAM and LIME for interpreting the strengths and pitfalls of the models. Our results reveal substantial room for improvement in underwater species recognition and demonstrate the value of AQUA20 as a foundation for future research in this domain. The dataset is publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/taufiktrf/AQUA20.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection is essential for the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Current methods often focus on detection accuracy but neglect response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving, prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving millisecond-level real-time performance.

- **Summary**: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations, and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design. Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation, and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed input representations, or pre-existing maps.

- **Summary**: Traditional particle size distribution (PSD) analyses create significant downtime and are expensive in labor and maintenance. These drawbacks could be alleviated using optical grain size analysis integrated into routine geotechnical laboratory workflow. This paper presents a high-resolution dataset of 12,714 images of 321 different soil samples collected in the Montreal, Quebec region, alongside their PSD analysis. It is designed to provide a robust starting point for training convolutional neural networks (CNN) in geotechnical applications. Soil samples were photographed in a standardized top-view position with a resolution of 45 MP and a minimum scale of 39.4 micrometers per pixel, both in their moist and dry states. A custom test bench employing 13x9 inch white aluminum trays, on which the samples are spread in a thin layer, was used. For samples exceeding a size limit, a coning and quartering method was employed for mass reduction.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining attention in medical image analysis. These are pre-trained on large, heterogeneous data sources, yielding rich and transferable representations. Notably, the combination of modality-specialized VLMs with few-shot adaptation has provided fruitful results, enabling the efficient deployment of high-performing solutions. However, previous works on this topic make strong assumptions about the distribution of adaptation data, which are unrealistic in the medical domain. First, prior art assumes access to a balanced support set, a condition that breaks the natural imbalance in disease prevalence found in real-world scenarios. Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional validation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly data-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and introduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting. Our extensive benchmark across various modalities and downstream tasks demonstrates that current methods systematically compromise their performance when operating under realistic conditions, occasionally even performing worse than zero-shot inference. Also, we introduce a training-free linear probe that adaptively blends visual and textual supervision. Detailed studies demonstrate that the proposed solver is a strong, efficient baseline, enabling robust adaptation in challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: Following successful large-vessel recanalization via endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), some patients experience a complication known as no-reflow, defined by persistent microvascular hypoperfusion that undermines tissue recovery and worsens clinical outcomes. Although prompt identification is crucial, standard clinical practice relies on perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24 hours post-procedure, delaying intervention. In this work, we introduce the first-ever machine learning (ML) framework to predict no-reflow immediately after EVT by leveraging previously unexplored intra-procedural digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences and clinical variables. Our retrospective analysis included AIS patients treated at UCLA Medical Center (2011-2024) who achieved favorable mTICI scores (2b-3) and underwent pre- and post-procedure MRI. No-reflow was defined as persistent hypoperfusion (Tmax > 6 s) on post-procedural imaging. From DSA sequences (AP and lateral views), we extracted statistical and temporal perfusion features from the target downstream territory to train ML classifiers for predicting no-reflow. Our novel method significantly outperformed a clinical-features baseline(AUC: 0.7703 $\pm$ 0.12 vs. 0.5728 $\pm$ 0.12; accuracy: 0.8125 $\pm$ 0.10 vs. 0.6331 $\pm$ 0.09), demonstrating that real-time DSA perfusion dynamics encode critical insights into microvascular integrity. This approach establishes a foundation for immediate, accurate no-reflow prediction, enabling clinicians to proactively manage high-risk patients without reliance on delayed imaging.

- **Summary**: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented transfer capabilities and are being increasingly adopted for data-efficient image classification. Despite its growing popularity, its reliability aspect remains largely unexplored. This work explores the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to provide trustworthiness guarantees when transferring such models based on a small labeled calibration set. Despite its potential, the generalist nature of the VLMs' pre-training could negatively affect the properties of the predicted conformal sets for specific tasks. While common practice in transfer learning for discriminative purposes involves an adaptation stage, we observe that deploying such a solution for conformal purposes is suboptimal since adapting the model using the available calibration data breaks the rigid exchangeability assumptions for test data in SCP. To address this issue, we propose transductive split conformal adaptation (SCA-T), a novel pipeline for transfer learning on conformal scenarios, which performs an unsupervised transductive adaptation jointly on calibration and test data. We present comprehensive experiments utilizing medical VLMs across various image modalities, transfer tasks, and non-conformity scores. Our framework offers consistent gains in efficiency and conditional coverage compared to SCP, maintaining the same empirical guarantees.

- **Summary**: Despite its importance for performance and injury prevention, golf swing analysis is limited by isolated metrics, underrepresentation of professional athletes, and a lack of rich, interpretable movement representations. We address these gaps with a holistic, data-driven framework for personalized golf swing analysis from a single wrist-worn sensor. We build a large dataset of professional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D kinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate synthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment swing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete vocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and visualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player identity, club type, sex, and age. Our system accurately estimates full-body kinematics and swing events from wrist data, delivering lab-grade motion analysis on-course and supporting early detection of anomalous movement patterns. Explainability methods reveal subtle, individualized movement signatures, reinforcing the view that variability is a hallmark of skilled performance. Longitudinal tracking demonstrates practical value: as one player's handicap improved from 50 to 2.2 over 1.5 years, our system captured measurable technical progress and provided targeted, actionable feedback. Our findings challenge common assumptions, such as swing consistency across clubs and the existence of a single "ideal" swing, and uncover latent biomarkers shaped by both intrinsic traits and task-specific constraints. This work bridges lab and field-based biomechanics, offering scalable, accessible, high-fidelity motion analysis for research, coaching, and injury prevention, while opening new directions in movement-based phenotyping, personalized equipment design, and motor skill development.

- **Summary**: Active event perception, the ability to dynamically detect, track, and summarize events in real time, is essential for embodied intelligence in tasks such as human-AI collaboration, assistive robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, existing approaches often depend on predefined action spaces, annotated datasets, and extrinsic rewards, limiting their adaptability and scalability in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Inspired by cognitive theories of event perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised framework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied control through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and entropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and actively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or external rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an action-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with observations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target continuity, and adaptability to novel environments. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate EASE's ability to achieve privacy-preserving and scalable event perception, providing a robust foundation for embodied systems in unscripted, dynamic tasks.
