- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation from pretrained visual representation models offers an effective approach to improve small, task-specific production models. However, the effectiveness of such knowledge transfer drops significantly when distilling from strong models that are pretrained in a large scale. In this paper, we address this challenge for pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) by exploring methods to fine-tune them for more effective knowledge transfer. Motivated by the connection between mutual information and distillation effectiveness, we propose to employ mutual information-aware optimization during finetuning. For small or highly-imbalanced downstream datasets where such optimization becomes less effective, we introduce a simple yet effective heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks. This approach is inspired by our observation that top MLP blocks are primarily responsible for mutual information loss. Our method enables small student models to benefit from those pretrained models among the strongest.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful approach in novel view synthesis, delivering rapid training and rendering but at the cost of an ever-growing set of Gaussian primitives that strains memory and bandwidth. We introduce AutoOpti3DGS, a training-time framework that automatically restrains Gaussian proliferation without sacrificing visual fidelity. The key idea is to feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks, and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with memory or storage-constrained hardware.

  generation, and image editing. GitHub: https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Ovis-U1
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1 incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves 4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

- **Summary**: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions. However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi, covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

- **Summary**: Empowering Small-scale Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) with reliable thinking capabilities remains fundamentally challenging due to their limited parameter capacity and weak instruction-following abilities. Existing training paradigms, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding the capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to SVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse, ultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A natural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity to reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted two-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency toward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of the combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm that Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via RLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes to the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that DyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial performance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and effective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities. GitHub: https://github.com/HKUST-LongGroup/DyME

- **Summary**: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years, yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness, generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically, CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles from single-view images remains a challenging task due to the intricate interwoven structure and complex topologies of braids. Existing strand-based hair reconstruction methods typically focus on loose hairstyles and often struggle to capture the fine-grained geometry of braided hair. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised pipeline for efficiently reconstructing 3D braided hair from single-view RGB images. Leveraging a synthetic braid model inspired by braid theory, our approach effectively captures the complex intertwined structures of braids. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, providing superior accuracy, realism, and efficiency in reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles, supporting expressive hairstyle modeling in digital humans.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning (CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect. Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel attacks.

- **Summary**: Existing deep learning-based cross-view geo-localization methods primarily focus on improving the accuracy of cross-domain image matching, rather than enabling models to comprehensively capture contextual information around the target and minimize the cost of localization errors. To support systematic research into this Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) problem, we construct Distance-Aware Campus (DA-Campus), the first benchmark that pairs multi-view imagery with precise distance annotations across three spatial resolutions. Based on DA-Campus, we formulate DACVGL as a hierarchical retrieval problem across different domains. Our study further reveals that, due to the inherent complexity of spatial relationships among buildings, this problem can only be addressed via a contrastive learning paradigm, rather than conventional metric learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dynamic Contrastive Learning (DyCL), a novel framework that progressively aligns feature representations according to hierarchical spatial margins. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyCL is highly complementary to existing multi-scale metric learning methods and yields substantial improvements in both hierarchical retrieval performance and overall cross-view geo-localization accuracy. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/anocodetest1/DyCL.

- **Summary**: Automated and accurate segmentation of individual vertebra in 3D CT and MRI images is essential for various clinical applications. Due to the limitations of current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing methods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and distinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a Frequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the accuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet transform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred images. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed separately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency Feature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter out noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the low-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM) to aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields, extracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies with linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is essential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both CT and MRI vertebrae segmentation datasets.

- **Summary**: Modeling task-driven attention in driving is a fundamental challenge for both autonomous vehicles and cognitive science. Existing methods primarily predict where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics (what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer interaction.

- **Summary**: The recent release of RadGenome-Chest CT has significantly advanced CT-based report generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on global features, making it challenging to capture region-specific details, which may cause certain abnormalities to go unnoticed. To address this, we propose MedRegion-CT, a region-focused Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce Region Representative ($R^2$) Token Pooling, which utilizes a 2D-wise pretrained vision model to efficiently extract 3D CT features. This approach generates global tokens representing overall slice features and region tokens highlighting target areas, enabling the MLLM to process comprehensive information effectively. Second, a universal segmentation model generates pseudo-masks, which are then processed by a mask encoder to extract region-centric features. This allows the MLLM to focus on clinically relevant regions, using six predefined region masks. Third, we leverage segmentation results to extract patient-specific attributions, including organ size, diameter, and locations. These are converted into text prompts, enriching the MLLM's understanding of patient-specific contexts. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we conducted benchmark experiments on report generation using the RadGenome-Chest CT. MedRegion-CT achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in natural language generation quality and clinical relevance while maintaining interpretability. The code for our framework is publicly available.

- **Summary**: Interactive segmentation (IS) allows users to iteratively refine object boundaries with minimal cues, such as positive and negative clicks. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered attention in the IS community for its promptable segmentation capabilities, it often struggles in specialized domains or when handling complex scenarios (e.g., camouflaged or multi-part objects). To overcome these challenges, we propose DC-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that adapts SAM on a per-sample basis by leveraging user interactions as supervision. Instead of forcing a single model to incorporate all user clicks at once, DC-TTA partitions the clicks into more coherent subsets, each processed independently via TTA with a separated model. This Divide-and-Conquer strategy reduces conflicts among diverse cues and enables more localized updates. Finally, we merge the adapted models to form a unified predictor that integrates the specialized knowledge from each subset. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-TTA significantly outperforms SAM's zero-shot results and conventional TTA methods, effectively handling complex tasks such as camouflaged object segmentation with fewer interactions and improved accuracy.

- **Summary**: Multi-stroke characters in scripts such as Chinese and Japanese can be highly complex, posing significant challenges for both native speakers and, especially, non-native learners. If these characters can be simplified without degrading their legibility, it could reduce learning barriers for non-native speakers, facilitate simpler and legible font designs, and contribute to efficient character-based communication systems. In this paper, we propose a framework to systematically simplify multi-stroke characters by selectively removing strokes while preserving their overall legibility. More specifically, we use a highly accurate character recognition model to assess legibility and remove those strokes that minimally impact it. Experimental results on 1,256 character classes with 5, 10, 15, and 20 strokes reveal several key findings, including the observation that even after removing multiple strokes, many characters remain distinguishable. These findings suggest the potential for more formalized simplification strategies.

- **Summary**: Accurate carotid plaque grading (CPG) is vital to assess the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the small size and high intra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a combination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical practice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification methods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the importance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To address these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement Framework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and Category-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold. First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based method for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second, we propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's global modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and diverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded down-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve implicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free mixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class clustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling at the Category level. Experimental results indicate that CVC-RF effectively models global features via multi-level refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the challenging CPG task.

- **Summary**: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs), have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with both model size and training data on MMEB.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable progress in scene understanding through vision-language alignment leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.

- **Summary**: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details, dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information. To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models. Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations mentioned earlier.

- **Summary**: Art plagiarism detection plays a crucial role in protecting artists' copyrights and intellectual property, yet it remains a challenging problem in forensic analysis. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing plagiarized paintings and explaining the detected plagarisms by retrieving visually similar authentic artworks. To support this study, we construct a dataset by collecting painting photos and synthesizing plagiarized versions using generative AI, tailored to specific artists' styles. We first establish a baseline approach using off-the-shelf features from the visual foundation model DINOv2 to retrieve the most similar images in the database and classify plagiarism based on a similarity threshold. Surprisingly, this non-learned method achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\% but suffers from low retrieval precision 29.0\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval quality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and negative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly improves retrieval performance by 12\% AP over the baseline, though it unexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\%). We conclude with insightful discussions and outline directions for future research.

- **Summary**: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence, serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances 3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy training with generated data and policy evaluation. Our work provides new insights for building efficient physics-informed world models to advance embodied intelligence research.

- **Summary**: Since there exists a notable gap between user-provided and model-preferred prompts, generating high-quality and satisfactory images using diffusion models often requires prompt engineering to optimize user inputs. Current studies on text-to-image prompt engineering can effectively enhance the style and aesthetics of generated images. However, they often neglect the semantic alignment between generated images and user descriptions, resulting in visually appealing but content-wise unsatisfying outputs. In this work, we propose VisualPrompter, a novel training-free prompt engineering framework that refines user inputs to model-preferred sentences. In particular, VisualPrompter utilizes an automatic self-reflection module to identify the missing concepts in generated images and a target-specific prompt optimization mechanism to revise the prompts in a fine-grained manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our VisualPrompter, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks for text-image alignment evaluation. Additionally, our framework features a plug-and-play design, making it highly adaptable to various generative models.

- **Summary**: Privacy preservation in AI is crucial, especially in healthcare, where models rely on sensitive patient data. In the emerging field of machine unlearning, existing methodologies struggle to remove patient data from trained multimodal architectures, which are widely used in healthcare. We propose Forget-MI, a novel machine unlearning method for multimodal medical data, by establishing loss functions and perturbation techniques. Our approach unlearns unimodal and joint representations of the data requested to be forgotten while preserving knowledge from the remaining data and maintaining comparable performance to the original model. We evaluate our results using performance on the forget dataset, performance on the test dataset, and Membership Inference Attack (MIA), which measures the attacker's ability to distinguish the forget dataset from the training dataset. Our model outperforms the existing approaches that aim to reduce MIA and the performance on the forget dataset while keeping an equivalent performance on the test set. Specifically, our approach reduces MIA by 0.202 and decreases AUC and F1 scores on the forget set by 0.221 and 0.305, respectively. Additionally, our performance on the test set matches that of the retrained model, while allowing forgetting. Code is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/Forget-MI.git

- **Summary**: In the domain of vehicle telematics the automated recognition of driving maneuvers is used to classify and evaluate driving behaviour. This not only serves as a component to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application of time series classification which poses special challenges to the transfer, preprocessing and storage of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the field of gathering relevant data or regarding the methods to build predictive models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a practical need for python packages and functions that allow to quickly transform data into the required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The maneuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The implementation of the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons recorded via smartphone sensors.

- **Summary**: Single-image-to-3D models typically follow a sequential generation and reconstruction workflow. However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC), significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution, establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC, seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution (FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289, leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis for dynamic $3$D scenes poses a significant challenge. Many notable efforts use NeRF-based approaches to address this task and yield impressive results. However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion parallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes limited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods encounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry and inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior methods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To address the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth Regularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align with the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use depth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the expectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample points from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce constraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object boundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the correct geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a visualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at the rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera parameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to camera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion input, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning representations through comparison methods that align with human intuition. However, mainstream SSL methods heavily rely on high body datasets with single label, such as ImageNet, resulting in intolerable pre-training overhead. Besides, more general multi-label images are frequently overlooked in SSL, despite their potential for richer semantic information and broader applicability in downstream scenarios. Therefore, we tailor the mainstream SSL approach to guarantee excellent representation learning capabilities using fewer multi-label images. Firstly, we propose a block-wise augmentation module aimed at extracting additional potential positive view pairs from multi-label images. Subsequently, an image-aware contrastive loss is devised to establish connections between these views, thereby facilitating the extraction of semantically consistent representations. Comprehensive linear fine-tuning and transfer learning validate the competitiveness of our approach despite challenging sample quality and quantity.

- **Summary**: High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects. To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining visualizes histology but lacks specificity for diagnostic markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining provides protein-targeted staining but is restricted by tissue availability and antibody specificity. Virtual staining, i.e., computationally translating the H&E image to its IHC counterpart while preserving the tissue structure, is promising for efficient IHC generation. Existing virtual staining methods still face key challenges: 1) effective decomposition of staining style and tissue structure, 2) controllable staining process adaptable to diverse tissue and proteins, and 3) rigorous structural consistency modelling to handle the non-pixel-aligned nature of paired H&E and IHC images. This study proposes a mutual-information (MI)-guided score-based diffusion model for unpaired virtual staining. Specifically, we design 1) a global MI-guided energy function that disentangles the tissue structure and staining characteristics across modalities, 2) a novel timestep-customized reverse diffusion process for precise control of the staining intensity and structural reconstruction, and 3) a local MI-driven contrastive learning strategy to ensure the cellular level structural consistency between H&E-IHC images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its biomedical potential. Codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: As face forgeries generated by deep neural networks become increasingly sophisticated, detecting face manipulations in digital media has posed a significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maintaining digital media integrity and combating visual disinformation. Current detection models, predominantly based on supervised training with domain-specific data, often falter against forgeries generated by unencountered techniques. In response to this challenge, we introduce \textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection framework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for enhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \textit{Trident} is trained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries, capturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from manipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance generalizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery discriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards forgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen manipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head to the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to certain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will release our code in a GitHub repository.

- **Summary**: Real-world videos often contain overlapping events and complex temporal dependencies, making multimodal interaction modeling particularly challenging. We introduce DEL, a framework for dense semantic action localization, aiming to accurately detect and classify multiple actions at fine-grained temporal resolutions in long untrimmed videos. DEL consists of two key modules: the alignment of audio and visual features that leverage masked self-attention to enhance intra-mode consistency and a multimodal interaction refinement module that models cross-modal dependencies across multiple scales, enabling high-level semantics and fine-grained details. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world Temporal Action Localization (TAL) datasets, UnAV-100, THUMOS14, ActivityNet 1.3, and EPIC-Kitchens-100, surpassing previous approaches with notable average mAP gains of +3.3%, +2.6%, +1.2%, +1.7% (verb), and +1.4% (noun), respectively.

- **Summary**: The person search task aims to locate a target person within a set of scene images. In recent years, transformer-based models in this field have made some progress. However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the self-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the features, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost of transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel High-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person search. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction capabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and improving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that progressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our model enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from augmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention layers in the transformer with a strategy based on multi-level Haar wavelet fusion to capture multi-scale features. This not only lowers the computational complexity but also alleviates the suppression of high-frequency features and enhances the ability to exploit multi-scale information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAMW achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

- **Summary**: Existing diffusion-based 3D shape completion methods typically use a conditional paradigm, injecting incomplete shape information into the denoising network via deep feature interactions (e.g., concatenation, cross-attention) to guide sampling toward complete shapes, often represented by voxel-based distance functions. However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover, performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints, limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion via latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for unseen object classes.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM systems to achieve high-fidelity scene representation. However, the heavy reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 69.0\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. The implementation of our method will be released as open-source.

- **Summary**: We present our solution for the Multi-Source COVID-19 Detection Challenge, which aims to classify chest CT scans into COVID and Non-COVID categories across data collected from four distinct hospitals and medical centers. A major challenge in this task lies in the domain shift caused by variations in imaging protocols, scanners, and patient populations across institutions. To enhance the cross-domain generalization of our model, we incorporate Variance Risk Extrapolation (VREx) into the training process. VREx encourages the model to maintain consistent performance across multiple source domains by explicitly minimizing the variance of empirical risks across environments. This regularization strategy reduces overfitting to center-specific features and promotes learning of domain-invariant representations. We further apply Mixup data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness. Mixup interpolates both the inputs and labels of randomly selected pairs of training samples, encouraging the model to behave linearly between examples and enhancing its resilience to noise and limited data. Our method achieves an average macro F1 score of 0.96 across the four sources on the validation set, demonstrating strong generalization.

- **Summary**: Timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is critical in clinical settings to prevent serious complications. While CT imaging remains the standard diagnostic tool, the growing number of cases can overwhelm radiologists, potentially causing delays. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that leverages 3D CT scans for appendicitis classification, incorporating Slice Attention mechanisms guided by external 2D datasets to enhance small lesion detection. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical classification framework using pre-trained 2D models to differentiate between simple and complicated appendicitis. Our approach improves AUC by 3% for appendicitis and 5.9% for complicated appendicitis, offering a more efficient and reliable diagnostic solution compared to previous work.

- **Summary**: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks. Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

- **Summary**: The paper proposes a statistical learning approach to the problem of estimating missing pixels of images, crucial for image inpainting and super-resolution problems. One of the main novelties of the method is that it also provides uncertainty quantifications together with the estimated values. Our core assumption is that the underlying data-generating function comes from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A special emphasis is put on band-limited functions, central to signal processing, which form Paley-Wiener type RKHSs. The proposed method, which we call Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel Interpolation (SGKI), is an extension and refinement of a recently developed kernel method. An advantage of SGKI is that it not only estimates the missing pixels, but also builds non-asymptotic confidence bands for the unobserved values, which are simultaneously guaranteed for all missing pixels. We also show how to compute these bands efficiently using Schur complements, we discuss a generalization to vector-valued functions, and we present a series of numerical experiments on various datasets containing synthetically generated and benchmark images, as well.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates indoor point cloud semantic segmentation under scene-level annotation, which is less explored compared to methods relying on sparse point-level labels. In the absence of precise point-level labels, current methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used to train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for each point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable challenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to enhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation framework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point semantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module, our method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with corresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning. To further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we introduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional semantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics, which are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions. Leveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate point-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality pseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and S3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our approach's individual components. The code is available at https://github.com/LHDuan/WSegPC .

- **Summary**: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and vision, enabling applications ranging from human motion analysis to understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients, significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy, and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images, (2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3) scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and efficiency gains.

- **Summary**: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However, reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights. SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and debugging image classifiers.

- **Summary**: The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has highlighted the importance of robust and efficient object detection in diverse aerial scenarios. Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often prioritize inference speed, leading to degraded performance when handling multi-modal inputs. To address this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed to effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV object detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps, resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference speeds.

- **Summary**: Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for users. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge communication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication latency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is only available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is proposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL) events. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI process communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event locating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are classified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree. Second, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a communication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help users interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a located PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is designed to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called the communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show its communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each leaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL event attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their simulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by analyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A supercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the efficiency of their simulations.

- **Summary**: Myocardial infarction is a major cause of death globally, and accurate early diagnosis from electrocardiograms (ECGs) remains a clinical priority. Deep learning models have shown promise for automated ECG interpretation, but require large amounts of labeled data, which are often scarce in practice. We propose a physiology-aware pipeline that (i) synthesizes 12-lead ECGs with tunable MI morphology and realistic noise, and (ii) pre-trains recurrent and transformer classifiers with self-supervised masked-autoencoding plus a joint reconstruction-classification objective. We validate the realism of synthetic ECGs via statistical and visual analysis, confirming that key morphological features are preserved. Pretraining on synthetic data consistently improved classification performance, particularly in low-data settings, with AUC gains of up to 4 percentage points. These results show that controlled synthetic ECGs can help improve MI detection when real clinical data is limited.

- **Summary**: Egocentricly comprehending the causes and effects of car accidents is crucial for the safety of self-driving cars, and synthesizing causal-entity reflected accident videos can facilitate the capability test to respond to unaffordable accidents in reality. However, incorporating causal relations as seen in real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion, Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video generation.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively, where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods, showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color, shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc).

- **Summary**: We present \textbf{Met}a-\textbf{T}oken \textbf{Le}arning (Mettle), a simple and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a lightweight \textit{Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)} module to distill in parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a \textit{Meta-Token Injection (MTI)} module, which utilizes the audio and visual meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

- **Summary**: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce $\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories, providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers' in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming its substantial practical value.

- **Summary**: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically, we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator. Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

- **Summary**: Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models (IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately, which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper, we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features. By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa, achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced the field of computer vision. To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing a fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In this context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed, e.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve generic training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of multiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to the poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks across different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive distillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as a teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance. Competitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task and engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to improve the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic perturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce mutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum. The experimental results show that competitive distillation achieves promising performance in diverse tasks and datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in AIGC have exacerbated the misuse of malicious deepfake content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In critical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the credibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation masks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of these methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most current deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few datasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted forgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data scale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. To address this predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and localization ($\textbf{DDL}$) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.8M}$ forged samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{75}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL design incorporates four key innovations: (1) $\textbf{Diverse Forgery Scenarios}$, (2) $\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods}$, (3) $\textbf{Varied Manipulation Modes}$, and (4) $\textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations}$. Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging benchmark for complex real-world forgeries, but also offers crucial support for building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability methods.

- **Summary**: Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing a target garment, with broad applications in e-commerce and digital fashion. While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment, the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform few-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However, safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases. Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference. Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

- **Summary**: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication among preterm neonates, with portable X-ray imaging serving as the standard diagnostic modality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). However, lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive alternative that avoids sedation and radiation while providing detailed insights into the underlying mechanisms of BPD. Leveraging high-resolution 3D MRI data, advanced image processing and semantic segmentation algorithms can be developed to assist clinicians in identifying the etiology of BPD. In this dataset, we present MRI scans paired with corresponding semantic segmentations of the lungs and trachea for 40 neonates, the majority of whom are diagnosed with BPD. The imaging data consist of free-breathing 3D stack-of-stars radial gradient echo acquisitions, known as the StarVIBE series. Additionally, we provide comprehensive clinical data and baseline segmentation models, validated against clinical assessments, to support further research and development in neonatal lung imaging.

- **Summary**: Accurate reconstruction of soft tissue is crucial for advancing automation in image-guided robotic surgery. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure. Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments, underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications.

- **Summary**: In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D surgical scenes with text-promptable capabilities is particularly crucial for surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model (VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization, which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training, particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by enhancing surgical precision and safety. Our code is available at: https://github.com/lastbasket/SurgTPGS.

- **Summary**: Realistic and interactive traffic simulation is essential for training and evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most existing data-driven simulation methods rely on static initialization or log-replay data, limiting their ability to model dynamic, long-horizon scenarios with evolving agent populations. We propose InfGen, a scenario generation framework that outputs agent states and trajectories in an autoregressive manner. InfGen represents the entire scene as a sequence of tokens, including traffic light signals, agent states, and motion vectors, and uses a transformer model to simulate traffic over time. This design enables InfGen to continuously insert new agents into traffic, supporting infinite scene generation. Experiments demonstrate that InfGen produces realistic, diverse, and adaptive traffic behaviors. Furthermore, reinforcement learning policies trained in InfGen-generated scenarios achieve superior robustness and generalization, validating its utility as a high-fidelity simulation environment for autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Multi-agent collaborative driving promises improvements in traffic safety and efficiency through collective perception and decision making. However, existing communication media -- including raw sensor data, neural network features, and perception results -- suffer limitations in bandwidth efficiency, information completeness, and agent interoperability. Moreover, traditional approaches have largely ignored decision-level fusion, neglecting critical dimensions of collaborative driving. In this paper we argue that addressing these challenges requires a transition from purely perception-oriented data exchanges to explicit intent and reasoning communication using natural language. Natural language balances semantic density and communication bandwidth, adapts flexibly to real-time conditions, and bridges heterogeneous agent platforms. By enabling the direct communication of intentions, rationales, and decisions, it transforms collaborative driving from reactive perception-data sharing into proactive coordination, advancing safety, efficiency, and transparency in intelligent transportation systems.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets. Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the computation costs and the quality of the segmentation mask. In this work, we present FA-Seg, a Fast and Accurate training-free framework for open-vocabulary segmentation based on diffusion models. FA-Seg performs segmentation using only a (1+1)-step from a pretrained diffusion model. Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FA-Seg performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the segmentation quality, FA-Seg introduces three key components: (i) a dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction, (ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances semantic precision via multi-resolution attention fusion, and (iii) a Test-Time Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive experiments show that FA-Seg achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that FA-Seg provides a strong foundation for extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference efficiency.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs) with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying 3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight current limitations, particularly in visual precision rather than basic tool usage. IR3D-Bench, including data and evaluation protocols, is released to facilitate systematic study and development of tool-using VLAs towards genuine scene understanding by creating.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images. Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to 0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation, we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.

- **Summary**: The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with 3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues, distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii) Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement. Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language.

- **Summary**: Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light. However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components: layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  for controllable subject-driven video customization
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus, with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD (Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios. Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world deployment.

- **Summary**: Fever screening based on infrared thermographs (IRTs) is a viable mass screening approach during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and SARS, for temperature monitoring in public places like hospitals and airports. IRTs have found to be powerful, quick and non-invasive methods to detect elevated temperatures. Moreover, regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi (called the canthi regions in this paper) are preferred sites for fever screening. Accurate localization of the canthi regions can be achieved through multi-modal registration of infrared (IR) and white-light images. We proposed a registration method through a coarse-fine registration strategy using different registration models based on landmarks and edge detection on eye contours. We evaluated the registration accuracy to be within 2.7 mm, which enables accurate localization of the canthi regions.

- **Summary**: Smartphone-based heart rate (HR) monitoring apps using finger-over-camera photoplethysmography (PPG) face significant challenges in performance evaluation and device compatibility due to device variability and fragmentation. Manual testing is impractical, and standardized methods are lacking. This paper presents a novel, high-throughput bench-testing platform to address this critical need. We designed a system comprising a test rig capable of holding 12 smartphones for parallel testing, a method for generating synthetic PPG test videos with controllable HR and signal quality, and a host machine for coordinating video playback and data logging. The system achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.11% +/- 0.001% between input and measured HR, and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 +/- 0.008 between input and measured PPG signals using a clinically-validated smartphone-based HR app. Bench-testing results of 20 different smartphone models correctly classified all the devices as meeting the ANSI/CTA accuracy standards for HR monitors (MAPE <10%) when compared to a prospective clinical study with 80 participants, demonstrating high positive predictive value. This platform offers a scalable solution for pre-deployment testing of smartphone HR apps to improve app performance, ensure device compatibility, and advance the field of mobile health.

- **Summary**: Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality, realistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional generation, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the input prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore, PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless' based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in dynamic environments.
