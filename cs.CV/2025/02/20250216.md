- **Summary**: Test time scaling is currently one of the most active research areas that shows promise after training time scaling has reached its limits. Deep-thinking (DT) models are a class of recurrent models that can perform easy-to-hard generalization by assigning more compute to harder test samples. However, due to their inability to determine the complexity of a test sample, DT models have to use a large amount of computation for both easy and hard test samples. Excessive test time computation is wasteful and can cause the ``overthinking'' problem where more test time computation leads to worse results. In this paper, we introduce a test time training method for determining the optimal amount of computation needed for each sample during test time. We also propose Conv-LiGRU, a novel recurrent architecture for efficient and robust visual reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Conv-LiGRU is more stable than DT, effectively mitigates the ``overthinking'' phenomenon, and achieves superior accuracy.

- **Summary**: Attention is fundamental to both biological and artificial intelligence, yet research on animal attention and AI self attention remains largely disconnected. We propose a Recurrent Vision Transformer (Recurrent ViT) that integrates self-attention with recurrent memory, allowing both current inputs and stored information to guide attention allocation. Trained solely via sparse reward feedback on a spatially cued orientation change detection task, a paradigm used in primate studies, our model exhibits primate like signatures of attention, including improved accuracy and faster responses for cued stimuli that scale with cue validity. Analysis of self-attention maps reveals dynamic spatial prioritization with reactivation prior to expected changes, and targeted perturbations produce performance shifts similar to those observed in primate frontal eye fields and superior colliculus. These findings demonstrate that incorporating recurrent feedback into self attention can capture key aspects of primate visual attention.

- **Summary**: Accurate nowcasting of convective clouds from satellite imagery is essential for mitigating the impacts of meteorological disasters, especially in developing countries and remote regions with limited ground-based observations. Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in video prediction; however, existing models frequently produce blurry results and exhibit reduced accuracy when forecasting physical fields. Here, we introduce SATcast, a diffusion model that leverages a cascade architecture and multimodal inputs for nowcasting cloud fields in satellite imagery. SATcast incorporates physical fields predicted by FuXi, a deep-learning weather model, alongside past satellite observations as conditional inputs to generate high-quality future cloud fields. Through comprehensive evaluation, SATcast outperforms conventional methods on multiple metrics, demonstrating its superior accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies underscore the importance of its multimodal design and the cascade architecture in achieving reliable predictions. Notably, SATcast maintains predictive skill for up to 24 hours, underscoring its potential for operational nowcasting applications.

- **Summary**: Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has drawn significant attention in the area of 3D map reconstruction and visual SLAM. While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.

- **Summary**: 3D facial reconstruction from a single in-the-wild image is a crucial task in human-centered computer vision tasks. While existing methods can recover accurate facial shapes, there remains significant space for improvement in fine-grained expression capture. Current approaches struggle with irregular mouth shapes, exaggerated expressions, and asymmetrical facial movements. We present TEASER (Token EnhAnced Spatial modeling for Expressions Reconstruction), which addresses these challenges and enhances 3D facial geometry performance. TEASER tackles two main limitations of existing methods: insufficient photometric loss for self-reconstruction and inaccurate localization of subtle expressions. We introduce a multi-scale tokenizer to extract facial appearance information. Combined with a neural renderer, these tokens provide precise geometric guidance for expression reconstruction. Furthermore, TEASER incorporates a pose-dependent landmark loss to further improve geometric performances. Our approach not only significantly enhances expression reconstruction quality but also offers interpretable tokens suitable for various downstream applications, such as photorealistic facial video driving, expression transfer, and identity swapping. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that TEASER achieves state-of-the-art performance in precise expression reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Decomposing geometry, materials and lighting from a set of images, namely inverse rendering, has been a long-standing problem in computer vision and graphics. Recent advances in neural rendering enable photo-realistic and plausible inverse rendering results. The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has boosted it to the next level by showing real-time rendering potentials. An intuitive finding is that the models used for inverse rendering do not take into account the dependency of opacity w.r.t. material properties, namely cross section, as suggested by optics. Therefore, we develop a novel approach that adds this dependency to the modeling itself. Inspired by radiative transfer, we augment the opacity term by introducing a neural network that takes as input material properties to provide modeling of cross section and a physically correct activation function. The gradients for material properties are therefore not only from color but also from opacity, facilitating a constraint for their optimization. Therefore, the proposed method incorporates more accurate physical properties compared to previous works. We implement our method into 3 different baselines that use Gaussian Splatting for inverse rendering and achieve significant improvements universally in terms of novel view synthesis and material modeling.

- **Summary**: This work demonstrates that diffusion models can achieve font-controllable multilingual text rendering using just raw images without font label annotations. Visual text rendering remains a significant challenge. While recent methods condition diffusion on glyphs, it is impossible to retrieve exact font annotations from large-scale, real-world datasets, which prevents user-specified font control. To address this, we propose a data-driven solution that integrates the conditional diffusion model with a text segmentation model, utilizing segmentation masks to capture and represent fonts in pixel space in a self-supervised manner, thereby eliminating the need for any ground-truth labels and enabling users to customize text rendering with any multilingual font of their choice. The experiment provides a proof of concept of our algorithm in zero-shot text and font editing across diverse fonts and languages, providing valuable insights for the community and industry toward achieving generalized visual text rendering.



### Adjust Your Focus: Defocus Deblurring From Dual-Pixel Images Using Explicit Multi-Scale Cross-Correlation

- **Summary**: Defocus blur is a common problem in photography. It arises when an image is captured with a wide aperture, resulting in a shallow depth of field. Sometimes it is desired, e.g., in portrait effect. Otherwise, it is a problem from both an aesthetic point of view and downstream computer vision tasks, such as segmentation and depth estimation. Defocusing an out-of-focus image to obtain an all-in-focus image is a highly challenging and often ill-posed problem. A recent work exploited dual-pixel (DP) image information, widely available in consumer DSLRs and high-end smartphones, to solve the problem of defocus deblurring. DP sensors result in two sub-aperture views containing defocus disparity cues. A given pixel's disparity is directly proportional to the distance from the focal plane. However, the existing methods adopt a na\"ive approach of a channel-wise concatenation of the two DP views without explicitly utilizing the disparity cues within the network. In this work, we propose to perform an explicit cross-correlation between the two DP views to guide the network for appropriate deblurring in different image regions. We adopt multi-scale cross-correlation to handle blur and disparities at different scales. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our multi-scale cross-correlation network (MCCNet) reveals that it achieves better defocus deblurring than existing state-of-the-art methods despite having lesser computational complexity.



### FeaKM: Robust Collaborative Perception under Noisy Pose Conditions

- **Summary**: Collaborative perception is essential for networks of agents with limited sensing capabilities, enabling them to work together by exchanging information to achieve a robust and comprehensive understanding of their environment. However, localization inaccuracies often lead to significant spatial message displacement, which undermines the effectiveness of these collaborative efforts. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FeaKM, a novel method that employs Feature-level Keypoints Matching to effectively correct pose discrepancies among collaborating agents. Our approach begins by utilizing a confidence map to identify and extract salient points from intermediate feature representations, allowing for the computation of their descriptors. This step ensures that the system can focus on the most relevant information, enhancing the matching process. We then implement a target-matching strategy that generates an assignment matrix, correlating the keypoints identified by different agents. This is critical for establishing accurate correspondences, which are essential for effective collaboration. Finally, we employ a fine-grained transformation matrix to synchronize the features of all agents and ascertain their relative statuses, ensuring coherent communication among them. Our experimental results demonstrate that FeaKM significantly outperforms existing methods on the DAIR-V2X dataset, confirming its robustness even under severe noise conditions. The code and implementation details are available at https://github.com/uestchjw/FeaKM.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the fluency and logical coherence of image captioning. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely adopted to incorporate external knowledge into LLMs; however, existing RAG-based methods rely on separate retrieval banks, introducing computational overhead and limiting the utilization of LLMs' inherent zero-shot capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose TPCap, a novel trigger-augmented and multi-modal purification framework for zero-shot image captioning without external retrieval libraries. TPCap consists of two key components: trigger-augmented (TA) generation and multi-modal purification (MP). The TA module employs a trigger projector with frozen and learnable projections to activate LLMs' contextual reasoning, enhance visual-textual alignment, and mitigate data bias. The MP module further refines the generated entity-related information by filtering noise and enhancing feature quality, ensuring more precise and factually consistent captions. We evaluate TPCap on COCO, NoCaps, Flickr30k, and WHOOPS datasets. With only 0.82M trainable parameters and training on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, TPCap achieves competitive performance comparable to state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Multi-View Representation Learning (MVRL) aims to derive a unified representation from multi-view data by leveraging shared and complementary information across views. However, when views are irregularly missing, the incomplete data can lead to representations that lack sufficiency and consistency. To address this, we propose Multi-View Permutation of Variational Auto-Encoders (MVP), which excavates invariant relationships between views in incomplete data. MVP establishes inter-view correspondences in the latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders, enabling the inference of missing views and the aggregation of more sufficient information. To derive a valid Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) for learning, we apply permutations to randomly reorder variables for cross-view generation and then partition them by views to maintain invariant meanings under permutations. Additionally, we enhance consistency by introducing an informational prior with cyclic permutations of posteriors, which turns the regularization term into a similarity measure across distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on seven diverse datasets with varying missing ratios, achieving superior performance in multi-view clustering and generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Finding the cadastral boundaries of farmlands is a crucial concern for land administration. Therefore, using deep learning methods to expedite and simplify the extraction of cadastral boundaries from satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images is critical. In this paper, we employ transfer learning to train a U-Net model with a ResNet34 backbone to detect cadastral boundaries through three-class semantic segmentation: "boundary", "field", and "background". We evaluate the performance on two satellite images from farmlands in Iran using "precision", "recall", and "F-score", achieving high values of 88%, 75%, and 81%, respectively, which indicate promising results.

- **Summary**: Building AI systems, including Facial Expression Recognition (FER), involves two critical aspects: data and model design. Both components significantly influence bias and fairness in FER tasks. Issues related to bias and fairness in FER datasets and models remain underexplored. This study investigates bias sources in FER datasets and models. Four common FER datasets--AffectNet, ExpW, Fer2013, and RAF-DB--are analyzed. The findings demonstrate that AffectNet and ExpW exhibit high generalizability despite data imbalances. Additionally, this research evaluates the bias and fairness of six deep models, including three state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models: MobileNet, ResNet, XceptionNet, as well as three transformer-based models: ViT, CLIP, and GPT-4o-mini. Experimental results reveal that while GPT-4o-mini and ViT achieve the highest accuracy scores, they also display the highest levels of bias. These findings underscore the urgent need for developing new methodologies to mitigate bias and ensure fairness in datasets and models, particularly in affective computing applications.

- **Summary**: The continuous development of foundational models for video generation is evolving into various applications, with subject-consistent video generation still in the exploratory stage. We refer to this as Subject-to-Video, which extracts subject elements from reference images and generates subject-consistent video through textual instructions. We believe that the essence of subject-to-video lies in balancing the dual-modal prompts of text and image, thereby deeply and simultaneously aligning both text and visual content. To this end, we propose Phantom, a unified video generation framework for both single and multi-subject references. Building on existing text-to-video and image-to-video architectures, we redesign the joint text-image injection model and drive it to learn cross-modal alignment via text-image-video triplet data. In particular, we emphasize subject consistency in human generation, covering existing ID-preserving video generation while offering enhanced advantages.

- **Summary**: Medical image sequences, generated by both 2D video-based examinations and 3D imaging techniques, consist of sequential frames or slices that capture the same anatomical entities (e.g., organs or lesions) from multiple perspectives. Existing segmentation studies typically process medical images using either 2D or 3D methods in isolation, often overlooking the inherent consistencies among these images. Additionally, interactive segmentation, while highly beneficial in clinical scenarios, faces the challenge of integrating text prompts effectively across multi-modalities. To address these issues, we introduce an innovative task, Referring Medical Image Sequence Segmentation for the first time, which aims to segment the referred anatomical entities corresponding to medical text prompts. We develop a strong baseline model, Text-Promptable Propagation (TPP), designed to exploit the intrinsic relationships among sequential images and their associated textual descriptions. TPP supports the segmentation of arbitrary objects of interest based on cross-modal prompt fusion. Carefully designed medical prompts are fused and employed as queries to guide image sequence segmentation through triple-propagation. We curate a large and comprehensive benchmark covering 4 modalities and 20 different organs and lesions. Experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to previous methods across these datasets.

- **Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an essential skill for embodied agents, allowing them to navigate in 3D environments following natural language instructions. High-performance navigation models require a large amount of training data, the high cost of manually annotating data has seriously hindered this field. Therefore, some previous methods translate trajectory videos into step-by-step instructions for expanding data, but such instructions do not match well with users' communication styles that briefly describe destinations or state specific needs. Moreover, local navigation trajectories overlook global context and high-level task planning. To address these issues, we propose NavRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that generates user demand instructions for VLN. NavRAG leverages LLM to build a hierarchical scene description tree for 3D scene understanding from global layout to local details, then simulates various user roles with specific demands to retrieve from the scene tree, generating diverse instructions with LLM. We annotate over 2 million navigation instructions across 861 scenes and evaluate the data quality and navigation performance of trained models.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel Left-Prompt-Guided (LPG) paradigm to address a diverse range of reference-based vision tasks. Inspired by the human creative process, we reformulate these tasks using a left-right stitching formulation to construct contextual input. Building upon this foundation, we propose AnyRefill, an extension of LeftRefill, that effectively adapts Text-to-Image (T2I) models to various vision tasks. AnyRefill leverages the inpainting priors of advanced T2I model based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, and incorporates flexible components to enhance its capabilities. By combining task-specific LoRAs with the stitching input, AnyRefill unlocks its potential across diverse tasks, including conditional generation, visual perception, and image editing, without requiring additional visual encoders. Meanwhile, AnyRefill exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring minimal task-specific fine-tuning while maintaining high generative performance. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that AnyRefill outperforms other image condition injection methods and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art open-source methods. Notably, AnyRefill delivers results comparable to advanced commercial tools, such as IC-Light and SeedEdit, even in challenging scenarios. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across versatile tasks validate the strong generation of the proposed simple yet effective LPG formulation, establishing AnyRefill as a unified, highly data-efficient solution for reference-based vision tasks.

- **Summary**: In real-world scenarios, multi-view cameras are typically employed for fine-grained manipulation tasks. Existing approaches (e.g., ACT) tend to treat multi-view features equally and directly concatenate them for policy learning. However, it will introduce redundant visual information and bring higher computational costs, leading to ineffective manipulation. For a fine-grained manipulation task, it tends to involve multiple stages while the most contributed view for different stages is varied over time. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play best-feature-aware (BFA) fusion strategy for multi-view manipulation tasks, which is adaptable to various policies. Built upon the visual backbone of the policy network, we design a lightweight network to predict the importance score of each view. Based on the predicted importance scores, the reweighted multi-view features are subsequently fused and input into the end-to-end policy network, enabling seamless integration. Notably, our method demonstrates outstanding performance in fine-grained manipulations. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms multiple baselines by 22-46% success rate on different tasks. Our work provides new insights and inspiration for tackling key challenges in fine-grained manipulations.

- **Summary**: Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks, particularly in recognizing geographic information from images. However, significant challenges remain, including biases and privacy concerns. To systematically address these issues in the context of geographic information recognition, we introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of 1,200 images paired with detailed geographic metadata. Evaluating four VLMs, we find that while these models demonstrate the ability to recognize geographic information from images, achieving up to $53.8\%$ accuracy in city prediction, they exhibit significant regional biases. Specifically, performance is substantially higher for economically developed and densely populated regions compared to less developed ($-12.5\%$) and sparsely populated ($-17.0\%$) areas. Moreover, the models exhibit regional biases, frequently overpredicting certain locations; for instance, they consistently predict Sydney for images taken in Australia. The strong performance of VLMs also raises privacy concerns, particularly for users who share images online without the intent of being identified.

- **Summary**: Transformer has attracted increasing interest in STVG, owing to its end-to-end pipeline and promising result. Existing Transformer-based STVG approaches often leverage a set of object queries, which are initialized simply using zeros and then gradually learn target position information via iterative interactions with multimodal features, for spatial and temporal localization. Despite simplicity, these zero object queries, due to lacking target-specific cues, are hard to learn discriminative target information from interactions with multimodal features in complicated scenarios (\e.g., with distractors or occlusion), resulting in degradation. Addressing this, we introduce a novel Target-Aware Transformer for STVG (TA-STVG), which seeks to adaptively generate object queries via exploring target-specific cues from the given video-text pair, for improving STVG. The key lies in two simple yet effective modules, comprising text-guided temporal sampling (TTS) and attribute-aware spatial activation (ASA), working in a cascade. The former focuses on selecting target-relevant temporal cues from a video utilizing holistic text information, while the latter aims at further exploiting the fine-grained visual attribute information of the object from previous target-aware temporal cues, which is applied for object query initialization. Compared to existing methods leveraging zero-initialized queries, object queries in our TA-STVG, directly generated from a given video-text pair, naturally carry target-specific cues, making them adaptive and better interact with multimodal features for learning more discriminative information to improve STVG. In our experiments on three benchmarks, TA-STVG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms the baseline, validating its efficacy.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for object detection adapts models trained on labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, ensuring robust performance across domain shifts. Transformer-based architectures excel at capturing long-range dependencies but face efficiency challenges due to their quadratic attention complexity, which limits scalability in UDA tasks. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid domain-adaptive Mamba Transformer architecture that combines Mamba's efficient state-space modeling with attention mechanisms to tackle domain-specific spatial and channel-wise variations. Each hybrid block integrates domain-adaptive Mamba blocks and attention mechanisms: Domain-Adaptive Mamba employs spatial and channel state-space models to adaptively model domain variations, while attention mechanisms leverage self-attention for intra-domain feature enhancement and cross-attention for effective source-target alignment. Our approach processes both shallow and deeper features, employing an entropy-based knowledge distillation framework with margin ReLU to emphasize discriminative features and suppress noise. Gradient Reversal Layers enable adversarial alignment across network layers, while entropy-driven gating attention with random perturbations refines target features and mitigates overfitting. By unifying these components, our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in UDA object detection, balancing efficiency with robust generalization.

- **Summary**: Traditional Chinese acupuncture methods often face controversy in clinical practice due to their high subjectivity. Additionally, current intelligent-assisted acupuncture systems have two major limitations: slow acupoint localization speed and low accuracy. To address these limitations, a new method leverages the excellent inference efficiency of the state-space model Mamba, while retaining the advantages of the attention mechanism in the traditional DETR architecture, to achieve efficient global information integration and provide high-quality feature information for acupoint localization tasks. Furthermore, by employing the concept of residual likelihood estimation, it eliminates the need for complex upsampling processes, thereby accelerating the acupoint localization task. Our method achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on a private dataset of acupoints on the human back, with an average Euclidean distance pixel error (EPE) of 7.792 and an average time consumption of 10.05 milliseconds per localization task. Compared to the second-best algorithm, our method improved both accuracy and speed by approximately 14\%. This significant advancement not only enhances the efficacy of acupuncture treatment but also demonstrates the commercial potential of automated acupuncture robot systems.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded the capabilities of traditional language models by enabling interaction through both text and images. However, ensuring the safety of these models remains a significant challenge, particularly in accurately identifying whether multimodal content is safe or unsafe-a capability we term safety awareness. In this paper, we introduce MMSafeAware, the first comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across 29 safety scenarios with 1500 carefully curated image-prompt pairs. MMSafeAware includes both unsafe and over-safety subsets to assess models abilities to correctly identify unsafe content and avoid over-sensitivity that can hinder helpfulness. Evaluating nine widely used MLLMs using MMSafeAware reveals that current models are not sufficiently safe and often overly sensitive; for example, GPT-4V misclassifies 36.1% of unsafe inputs as safe and 59.9% of benign inputs as unsafe. We further explore three methods to improve safety awareness-prompting-based approaches, visual contrastive decoding, and vision-centric reasoning fine-tuning-but find that none achieve satisfactory performance. Our findings highlight the profound challenges in developing MLLMs with robust safety awareness, underscoring the need for further research in this area. All the code and data will be publicly available to facilitate future research.

- **Summary**: Current unlearning methods for large language models usually rely on reverse optimization to reduce target token probabilities. However, this paradigm disrupts the subsequent tokens prediction, degrading model performance and linguistic coherence. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics overemphasize contextual forgetting while inadequately assessing response fluency and relevance. To address these challenges, we propose ReLearn, a data augmentation and fine-tuning pipeline for effective unlearning, along with a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework introduces Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR) and Knowledge Retention Rate (KRR) to measure knowledge-level preservation, and Linguistic Score (LS) to evaluate generation quality. Our experiments show that ReLearn successfully achieves targeted forgetting while preserving high-quality output. Through mechanistic analysis, we further demonstrate how reverse optimization disrupts coherent text generation, while ReLearn preserves this essential capability.

- **Summary**: While deepfake technologies have predominantly been criticized for potential misuse, our study demonstrates their significant potential as tools for detecting, measuring, and mitigating biases in key societal domains. By employing deepfake technology to generate controlled facial images, we extend the scope of traditional correspondence studies beyond mere textual manipulations. This enhancement is crucial in scenarios such as pain assessments, where subjective biases triggered by sensitive features in facial images can profoundly affect outcomes. Our results reveal that deepfakes not only maintain the effectiveness of correspondence studies but also introduce groundbreaking advancements in bias measurement and correction techniques. This study emphasizes the constructive role of deepfake technologies as essential tools for advancing societal equity and fairness.

- **Summary**: Despite exceptional capabilities in knowledge-intensive tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) face a critical gap in understanding how they internalize new knowledge, particularly how to structurally embed acquired knowledge in their neural computations. We address this issue through the lens of knowledge circuit evolution, identifying computational subgraphs that facilitate knowledge storage and processing. Our systematic analysis of circuit evolution throughout continual pre-training reveals several key findings: (1) the acquisition of new knowledge is influenced by its relevance to pre-existing knowledge; (2) the evolution of knowledge circuits exhibits a distinct phase shift from formation to optimization; (3) the evolution of knowledge circuits follows a deep-to-shallow pattern. These insights not only advance our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of new knowledge acquisition in LLMs, but also provide potential implications for improving continual pre-training strategies to enhance model performance. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/zjunlp/DynamicKnowledgeCircuits.

- **Summary**: Generating long, high-quality videos remains a challenge due to the complex interplay of spatial and temporal dynamics and hardware limitations. In this work, we introduce \textbf{MaskFlow}, a unified video generation framework that combines discrete representations with flow-matching to enable efficient generation of high-quality long videos. By leveraging a frame-level masking strategy during training, MaskFlow conditions on previously generated unmasked frames to generate videos with lengths ten times beyond that of the training sequences. MaskFlow does so very efficiently by enabling the use of fast Masked Generative Model (MGM)-style sampling and can be deployed in both fully autoregressive as well as full-sequence generation modes. We validate the quality of our method on the FaceForensics (FFS) and Deepmind Lab (DMLab) datasets and report Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. We also provide a detailed analysis on the sampling efficiency of our method and demonstrate that MaskFlow can be applied to both timestep-dependent and timestep-independent models in a training-free manner.

- **Summary**: PET is affected by statistical noise due to constraints on tracer dose and scan duration, impacting both diagnostic performance and quantitative accuracy. While deep learning (DL)-based PET denoising methods have been used to improve image quality, they may introduce over-smoothing, compromising quantitative accuracy. We propose a method for making a DL solution more reliable and apply it to the conditional deep image prior (DIP). We introduce the idea of stability information in the optimization process of conditional DIP, enabling the identification of unstable regions within the network's optimization trajectory. Our method incorporates a stability map, which is derived from multiple intermediate outputs of moderate network at different optimization steps. The final denoised image is then obtained by computing linear combination of the DIP output and the original reconstructed image, weighted by the stability map. Our method effectively reduces noise while preserving small structure details in brain FDG images. Results demonstrated that our approach outperformed existing methods in peak-to-valley ratio and noise suppression across various low-dose levels. Region-of-interest analysis confirmed that the proposed method maintains quantitative accuracy without introducing under- or over-estimation. We applied our method to full-dose PET data to assess its impact on image quality. The results revealed that the proposed method significantly reduced background noise while preserving the peak-to-valley ratio at a level comparable to that of unfiltered full-dose PET images. The proposed method introduces a robust approach to DL-based PET denoising, enhancing its reliability and preserving quantitative accuracy. This strategy has the potential to advance performance in high-sensitivity PET scanners, demonstrating that DL can extend PET imaging capabilities beyond low-dose applications.

- **Summary**: Missing tissue presents a big challenge for dose mapping, e.g., in the reirradiation setting. We propose a pipeline to identify missing tissue on intra-patient structure meshes using a previously trained geometric-learning correspondence model. For our application, we relied on the prediction discrepancies between forward and backward correspondences of the input meshes, quantified using a correspondence-based Inverse Consistency Error (cICE). We optimised the threshold applied to cICE to identify missing points in a dataset of 35 simulated mandible resections. Our identified threshold, 5.5 mm, produced a balanced accuracy score of 0.883 in the training data, using an ensemble approach. This pipeline produced plausible results for a real case where ~25% of the mandible was removed after a surgical intervention. The pipeline, however, failed on a more extreme case where ~50% of the mandible was removed. This is the first time geometric-learning modelling is proposed to identify missing points in corresponding anatomy.

OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools.

- **Summary**: Single camera 3D perception for traffic monitoring faces significant challenges due to occlusion and limited field of view. Moreover, fusing information from multiple cameras at the image feature level is difficult because of different view angles. Further, the necessity for practical implementation and compatibility with existing traffic infrastructure compounds these challenges. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel Bird's-Eye-View road occupancy detection framework that leverages multiple roadside cameras to overcome the aforementioned limitations. To facilitate the framework's development and evaluation, a synthetic dataset featuring diverse scenes and varying camera configurations is generated using the CARLA simulator. A late fusion and three early fusion methods were implemented within the proposed framework, with performance further enhanced by integrating backgrounds. Extensive evaluations were conducted to analyze the impact of multi-camera inputs and varying BEV occupancy map sizes on model performance. Additionally, a real-world data collection pipeline was developed to assess the model's ability to generalize to real-world environments. The sim-to-real capabilities of the model were evaluated using zero-shot and few-shot fine-tuning, demonstrating its potential for practical application. This research aims to advance perception systems in traffic monitoring, contributing to improved traffic management, operational efficiency, and road safety.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are renowned for their superior instruction-following and reasoning capabilities across diverse problem domains. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on assessing factual and logical correctness in downstream tasks, with limited emphasis on evaluating MLLMs' ability to interpret pragmatic cues and intermodal relationships. To address this gap, we assess the competency of MLLMs in performing Multimodal Discourse Analysis (MDA) using Coherence Relations. Our benchmark, CORDIAL, encompasses a broad spectrum of Coherence Relations across 3 different discourse domains at varying levels of granularity. Through our experiments on 10+ MLLMs employing different prompting strategies, we show that even top models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o fail to match the performance of simple classifier-based baselines. This study emphasizes the need to move beyond similarity-based metrics and adopt a discourse-driven framework for evaluating MLLMs, providing a more nuanced assessment of their capabilities.

- **Summary**: A robust and efficient traffic monitoring system is essential for smart cities and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), using sensors and cameras to track vehicle movements, optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, enhance road safety, and enable real-time adaptive traffic control. Traffic monitoring models must comprehensively understand dynamic urban conditions and provide an intuitive user interface for effective management. This research leverages the LLaVA visual grounding multimodal large language model (LLM) for traffic monitoring tasks on the real-time Quanser Interactive Lab simulation platform, covering scenarios like intersections, congestion, and collisions. Cameras placed at multiple urban locations collect real-time images from the simulation, which are fed into the LLaVA model with queries for analysis. An instance segmentation model integrated into the cameras highlights key elements such as vehicles and pedestrians, enhancing training and throughput. The system achieves 84.3% accuracy in recognizing vehicle locations and 76.4% in determining steering direction, outperforming traditional models.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection (AD) in 3D point clouds is crucial in a wide range of industrial applications, especially in various forms of precision manufacturing. Considering the industrial demand for reliable 3D AD, several methods have been developed. However, most of these approaches typically require training separate models for each category, which is memory-intensive and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel Point-Language model with dual-prompts for 3D ANomaly dEtection (PLANE). The approach leverages multi-modal prompts to extend the strong generalization capabilities of pre-trained Point-Language Models (PLMs) to the domain of 3D point cloud AD, achieving impressive detection performance across multiple categories using a single model. Specifically, we propose a dual-prompt learning method, incorporating both text and point cloud prompts. The method utilizes a dynamic prompt creator module (DPCM) to produce sample-specific dynamic prompts, which are then integrated with class-specific static prompts for each modality, effectively driving the PLMs. Additionally, based on the characteristics of point cloud data, we propose a pseudo 3D anomaly generation method (Ano3D) to improve the model's detection capabilities in an unsupervised setting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, which is under the multi-class-one-model paradigm, achieves a +8.7%/+17% gain on anomaly detection and localization performance as compared to the state-of-the-art one-class-one-model methods for the Anomaly-ShapeNet dataset, and obtains +4.3%/+4.1% gain for the Real3D-AD dataset. Code will be available upon publication.
