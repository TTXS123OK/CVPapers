- **Summary**: Based on global genomic status, the cancer tumor is classified as Microsatellite Instable (MSI) and Microsatellite Stable (MSS). Immunotherapy is used to diagnose MSI, whereas radiation and chemotherapy are used for MSS. Therefore, it is significant to classify a gastro-intestinal (GI) cancer tumor into MSI vs. MSS to provide appropriate treatment. The existing literature showed that deep learning could directly predict the class of GI cancer tumors from histological images. However, deep learning (DL) models are susceptible to various threats, including membership inference attacks, model extraction attacks, etc. These attacks render the use of DL models impractical in real-world scenarios. To make the DL models useful and maintain privacy, we integrate differential privacy (DP) with DL. In particular, this paper aims to predict the state of GI cancer while preserving the privacy of sensitive data. We fine-tuned the Normalizer Free Net (NF-Net) model. We obtained an accuracy of 88.98\% without DP to predict (GI) cancer status. When we fine-tuned the NF-Net using DP-AdamW and adaptive DP-AdamW, we got accuracies of 74.58% and 76.48%, respectively. Moreover, we investigate the Weighted Random Sampler (WRS) and Class weighting (CW) to solve the data imbalance. We also evaluated and analyzed the DP algorithms in different settings.

- **Summary**: Machine learning applications in high-stakes scenarios should always operate under human oversight. Developing an optimal combination of human and machine intelligence requires an understanding of their complementarities, particularly regarding the similarities and differences in the way they make mistakes. We perform extensive experiments in the area of face recognition and compare two automated face recognition systems against human annotators through a demographically balanced user study. Our research uncovers important ways in which machine learning errors and human errors differ from each other, and suggests potential strategies in which human-machine collaboration can improve accuracy in face recognition.

- **Summary**: Radiographic testing is a fundamental non-destructive evaluation technique for identifying weld defects and assessing quality in industrial applications due to its high-resolution imaging capabilities. Over the past decade, deep learning techniques have significantly advanced weld defect identification in radiographic images. However, conventional approaches, which rely on training small-scale, task-specific models on single-scenario datasets, exhibit poor cross-scenario generalization. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a pre-trained visual foundation model trained on large-scale datasets, has demonstrated exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities. Fine-tuning SAM with limited domain-specific data has yielded promising results in fields such as medical image segmentation and anomaly detection. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce SAM-based segmentation for general weld radiographic testing images. We propose WRT-SAM, a novel weld radiographic defect segmentation model that leverages SAM through an adapter-based integration with a specialized prompt generator architecture. To improve adaptability to grayscale weld radiographic images, we introduce a frequency prompt generator module, which enhances the model's sensitivity to frequency-domain information. Furthermore, to address the multi-scale nature of weld defects, we incorporate a multi-scale prompt generator module, enabling the model to effectively extract and encode defect information across varying scales. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that WRT-SAM achieves a recall of 78.87%, a precision of 84.04%, and an AUC of 0.9746, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmark. Moreover, the model exhibits superior zero-shot generalization performance, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in diverse radiographic testing scenarios.

- **Summary**: We introduce GeoDANO, a geometric vision-language model (VLM) with a domain-agnostic vision encoder, for solving plane geometry problems. Although VLMs have been employed for solving geometry problems, their ability to recognize geometric features remains insufficiently analyzed. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark that evaluates the recognition of visual geometric features, including primitives such as dots and lines, and relations such as orthogonality. Our preliminary study shows that vision encoders often used in general-purpose VLMs, e.g., OpenCLIP, fail to detect these features and struggle to generalize across domains. We develop GeoCLIP, a CLIP based model trained on synthetic geometric diagram-caption pairs to overcome the limitation. Benchmark results show that GeoCLIP outperforms existing vision encoders in recognizing geometric features. We then propose our VLM, GeoDANO, which augments GeoCLIP with a domain adaptation strategy for unseen diagram styles. GeoDANO outperforms specialized methods for plane geometry problems and GPT-4o on MathVerse.

- **Summary**: UAV-View Geo-Localization (UVGL) aims to ascertain the precise location of a UAV by retrieving the most similar GPS-tagged satellite image. However, existing methods predominantly rely on supervised learning paradigms that necessitate annotated paired data for training, which incurs substantial annotation costs and impedes large-scale deployment. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Dynamic Memory-Driven and Neighborhood Information Learning (DMNIL) network, a lightweight end-to-end self-supervised framework for UAV-view geo-localization. The DMNIL framework utilizes a dual-path clustering-based contrastive learning architecture as its baseline to model intra-view structural relationships, enhancing feature consistency and discriminability. Additionally, a dynamic memory-driven hierarchical learning module is proposed to progressively mine local and global information, reinforcing multi-level feature associations to improve model robustness. To bridge the domain gap between UAV and satellite views, we design an information-consistent evolutionary learning mechanism that systematically explores latent correlations within intra-view neighborhoods and across cross-view domains, ultimately constructing a unified cross-view feature representation space. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (University-1652, SUES-200, and DenseUAV) demonstrate that DMNIL achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art supervised methods while maintaining computational efficiency. Notably, this superiority is attained without relying on paired training data, underscoring the framework's practicality for real-world deployment. Codes will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Accurate blur estimation is essential for high-performance imaging across various applications. Blur is typically represented by the point spread function (PSF). In this paper, we propose a physics-informed PSF learning framework for imaging systems, consisting of a simple calibration followed by a learning process. Our framework could achieve both high accuracy and universal applicability. Inspired by the Seidel PSF model for representing spatially varying PSF, we identify its limitations in optimization and introduce a novel wavefront-based PSF model accompanied by an optimization strategy, both reducing optimization complexity and improving estimation accuracy. Moreover, our wavefront-based PSF model is independent of lens parameters, eliminate the need for prior knowledge of the lens. To validate our approach, we compare it with recent PSF estimation methods (Degradation Transfer and Fast Two-step) through a deblurring task, where all the estimated PSFs are used to train state-of-the-art deblurring algorithms. Our approach demonstrates improvements in image quality in simulation and also showcases noticeable visual quality improvements on real captured images.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art methods for mesh detailization predominantly utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate detailed meshes from coarse ones. These methods typically learn a specific style code for each category or similar categories without enforcing geometry supervision across different Levels of Detail (LODs). Consequently, such methods often fail to generalize across a broader range of categories and cannot ensure shape consistency throughout the detailization process. In this paper, we introduce MARS, a novel approach for 3D shape detailization. Our method capitalizes on a novel multi-LOD, multi-category mesh representation to learn shape-consistent mesh representations in latent space across different LODs. We further propose a mesh autoregressive model capable of generating such latent representations through next-LOD token prediction. This approach significantly enhances the realism of the generated shapes. Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging 3D Shape Detailization benchmark demonstrate that our proposed MARS model achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Notably, the model's capability to generate fine-grained details while preserving the overall shape integrity is particularly commendable.

- **Summary**: Image retrieval has been employed as a robust complementary technique to address the challenge of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) self-positioning. However, most existing methods primarily focus on localizing objects captured by UAVs through complex part-based representations, often overlooking the unique challenges associated with UAV self-positioning, such as fine-grained spatial discrimination requirements and dynamic scene variations. To address the above issues, we propose the Context-Enhanced method for precise UAV Self-Positioning (CEUSP), specifically designed for UAV self-positioning tasks. CEUSP integrates a Dynamic Sampling Strategy (DSS) to efficiently select optimal negative samples, while the Rubik's Cube Attention (RCA) module, combined with the Context-Aware Channel Integration (CACI) module, enhances feature representation and discrimination by exploiting interdimensional interactions, inspired by the rotational mechanics of a Rubik's Cube. Extensive experimental validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating notable improvements in feature representation and UAV self-positioning accuracy within complex urban environments. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DenseUAV dataset, which is specifically designed for dense urban contexts, and also delivers competitive results on the widely recognized University-1652 benchmark.



### Do we Really Need Visual Instructions? Towards Visual Instruction-Free Fine-tuning for Large Vision-Language Models

- **Summary**: Visual instruction tuning has become the predominant technology in eliciting the multimodal task-solving capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Despite the success, as visual instructions require images as the input, it would leave the gap in inheriting the task-solving capabilities from the backbone LLMs, and make it costly to collect a large-scale dataset. To address it, we propose ViFT, a visual instruction-free fine-tuning framework for LVLMs. In ViFT, we only require the text-only instructions and image caption data during training, to separately learn the task-solving and visual perception abilities. During inference, we extract and combine the representations of the text and image inputs, for fusing the two abilities to fulfill multimodal tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ViFT can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several visual reasoning and visual instruction following benchmarks, with rather less training data. Our code and data will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiming to establish spatial correspondences between paired images. However, existing unsupervised deformable registration methods rely solely on intensity-based similarity metrics, lacking explicit anatomical knowledge, which limits their accuracy and robustness. Vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can generate high-quality segmentation masks that provide explicit anatomical structure knowledge, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that depend only on intensity similarity. Based on this, we propose a novel SAM-assisted registration framework incorporating prototype learning and contour awareness. The framework includes: (1) Explicit anatomical information injection, where SAM-generated segmentation masks are used as auxiliary inputs throughout training and testing to ensure the consistency of anatomical information; (2) Prototype learning, which leverages segmentation masks to extract prototype features and aligns prototypes to optimize semantic correspondences between images; and (3) Contour-aware loss, a contour-aware loss is designed that leverages the edges of segmentation masks to improve the model's performance in fine-grained deformation fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets, particularly in challenging scenarios with complex anatomical structures and ambiguous boundaries.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation aims to achieve accurate segmentation using few labelled data and numerous unlabelled data. The main challenge in the design of semi-supervised learning methods consists in the effective use of the unlabelled data for training. A promising solution consists of ensuring consistent predictions across different views of the data, where the efficacy of this strategy depends on the accuracy of the pseudo-labels generated by the model for this consistency learning strategy. In this paper, we introduce a new methodology to produce high-quality pseudo-labels for a consistency learning strategy to address semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation. The methodology has three important contributions. The first contribution is the Cooperative Rectification Learning Network (CRLN) that learns multiple prototypes per class to be used as external knowledge priors to adaptively rectify pseudo-labels at the voxel level. The second contribution consists of the Dynamic Interaction Module (DIM) to facilitate pairwise and cross-class interactions between prototypes and multi-resolution image features, enabling the production of accurate voxel-level clues for pseudo-label rectification. The third contribution is the Cooperative Positive Supervision (CPS), which optimises uncertain representations to align with unassertive representations of their class distributions, improving the model's accuracy in classifying uncertain regions. Extensive experiments on three public 3D medical segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our semi-supervised learning method.

- **Summary**: Image translation for change detection or classification in bi-temporal remote sensing images is unique. Although it can acquire paired images, it is still unsupervised. Moreover, strict semantic preservation in translation is always needed instead of multimodal outputs. In response to these problems, this paper proposes a new method, SRUIT (Semantically Robust Unsupervised Image-to-image Translation), which ensures semantically robust translation and produces deterministic output. Inspired by previous works, the method explores the underlying characteristics of bi-temporal Remote Sensing images and designs the corresponding networks. Firstly, we assume that bi-temporal Remote Sensing images share the same latent space, for they are always acquired from the same land location. So SRUIT makes the generators share their high-level layers, and this constraint will compel two domain mapping to fall into the same latent space. Secondly, considering land covers of bi-temporal images could evolve into each other, SRUIT exploits the cross-cycle-consistent adversarial networks to translate from one to the other and recover them. Experimental results show that constraints of sharing weights and cross-cycle consistency enable translated images with both good perceptual image quality and semantic preservation for significant differences.



### Learning to Sample Effective and Diverse Prompts for Text-to-Image Generation

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved impressive image generation capabilities. However, it remains challenging to control the generation process with desired properties (e.g., aesthetic quality, user intention), which can be expressed as black-box reward functions. In this paper, we focus on prompt adaptation, which refines the original prompt into model-preferred prompts to generate desired images. While prior work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize prompts, we observe that applying RL often results in generating similar postfixes and deterministic behaviors. To this end, we introduce \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}daptation with \textbf{G}FlowNets (\textbf{PAG}), a novel approach that frames prompt adaptation as a probabilistic inference problem. Our key insight is that leveraging Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) allows us to shift from reward maximization to sampling from an unnormalized density function, enabling both high-quality and diverse prompt generation. However, we identify that a naive application of GFlowNets suffers from mode collapse and uncovers a previously overlooked phenomenon: the progressive loss of neural plasticity in the model, which is compounded by inefficient credit assignment in sequential prompt generation. To address this critical challenge, we develop a systematic approach in PAG with flow reactivation, reward-prioritized sampling, and reward decomposition for prompt adaptation. Extensive experiments validate that PAG successfully learns to sample effective and diverse prompts for text-to-image generation. We also show that PAG exhibits strong robustness across various reward functions and transferability to different text-to-image models.

- **Summary**: The intersection of medical imaging and artificial intelligence has become an important research direction in intelligent medical treatment, particularly in the analysis of medical images using deep learning for clinical diagnosis. Despite the advances, existing keyframe classification methods lack extraction of time series features, while ultrasonic video classification based on three-dimensional convolution requires uniform frame numbers across patients, resulting in poor feature extraction efficiency and model classification performance. This study proposes a novel video classification method based on CNN and LSTM, introducing NLP's long and short sentence processing scheme into video classification for the first time. The method reduces CNN-extracted image features to 1x512 dimension, followed by sorting and compressing feature vectors for LSTM training. Specifically, feature vectors are sorted by patient video frame numbers and populated with padding value 0 to form variable batches, with invalid padding values compressed before LSTM training to conserve computing resources. Experimental results demonstrate that our variable-frame CNNLSTM method outperforms other approaches across all metrics, showing improvements of 3-6% in F1 score and 1.5% in specificity compared to keyframe methods. The variable-frame CNNLSTM also achieves better accuracy and precision than equal-frame CNNLSTM. These findings validate the effectiveness of our approach in classifying variable-frame ultrasound videos and suggest potential applications in other medical imaging modalities.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, yet they often struggle with visual arithmetic, seemingly simple capabilities like object counting or length comparison, which are essential for relevant complex tasks like chart understanding and geometric reasoning. In this work, we first investigate the root causes of this deficiency through a suite of probing tasks focusing on basic visual arithmetic. Our analysis reveals that while pre-trained vision encoders typically capture sufficient information, the text decoder often fails to decode it correctly for arithmetic reasoning. To address this, we propose CogAlign, a novel post-training strategy inspired by Piaget's theory of cognitive development. CogAlign trains VLMs to recognize invariant properties under visual transformations. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of three diverse VLMs on our proposed probing tasks. Furthermore, CogAlign enhances performance by an average of 4.6% on CHOCOLATE and 2.9% on MATH-VISION, outperforming or matching supervised fine-tuning methods while requiring only 60% less training data. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of CogAlign in improving fundamental visual arithmetic capabilities and their transfer to downstream tasks.



### Stop Looking for Important Tokens in Multimodal Language Models: Duplication Matters More

- **Summary**: Vision tokens in multimodal large language models often dominate huge computational overhead due to their excessive length compared to linguistic modality. Abundant recent methods aim to solve this problem with token pruning, which first defines an importance criterion for tokens and then prunes the unimportant vision tokens during inference. However, in this paper, we show that the importance is not an ideal indicator to decide whether a token should be pruned. Surprisingly, it usually results in inferior performance than random token pruning and leading to incompatibility to efficient attention computation operators.Instead, we propose DART (Duplication-Aware Reduction of Tokens), which prunes tokens based on its duplication with other tokens, leading to significant and training-free acceleration. Concretely, DART selects a small subset of pivot tokens and then retains the tokens with low duplication to the pivots, ensuring minimal information loss during token pruning. Experiments demonstrate that DART can prune 88.9% vision tokens while maintaining comparable performance, leading to a 1.99$\times$ and 2.99$\times$ speed-up in total time and prefilling stage, respectively, with good compatibility to efficient attention operators.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance for cross-modal understanding and generation, yet still suffer from severe inference costs. Recently, abundant works have been proposed to solve this problem with token pruning, which identifies the redundant tokens in MLLMs and then prunes them to reduce the computation and KV storage costs, leading to significant acceleration without training. While these methods claim efficiency gains, critical questions about their fundamental design and evaluation remain unanswered: Why do many existing approaches underperform even compared to naive random token selection? Are attention-based scoring sufficient for reliably identifying redundant tokens? Is language information really helpful during token pruning? What makes a good trade-off between token importance and duplication? Are current evaluation protocols comprehensive and unbiased? The ignorance of previous research on these problems hinders the long-term development of token pruning. In this paper, we answer these questions one by one, providing insights into the design of future token pruning methods.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have led to significant progress in audio-driven lip synchronization. However, existing methods typically rely on constrained audio-visual alignment priors or multi-stage learning of intermediate representations to force lip motion synthesis. This leads to complex training pipelines and limited motion naturalness. In this paper, we present SayAnything, a conditional video diffusion framework that directly synthesizes lip movements from audio input while preserving speaker identity. Specifically, we propose three specialized modules including identity preservation module, audio guidance module, and editing control module. Our novel design effectively balances different condition signals in the latent space, enabling precise control over appearance, motion, and region-specific generation without requiring additional supervision signals or intermediate representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SayAnything generates highly realistic videos with improved lip-teeth coherence, enabling unseen characters to say anything, while effectively generalizing to animated characters.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities of generating high-quality images closely aligned with textual inputs. However, the effectiveness of text guidance heavily relies on the CLIP text encoder, which is trained to pay more attention to general content but struggles to capture semantics in specific domains like styles. As a result, generation models tend to fail on prompts like "a photo of a cat in Pokemon style" in terms of simply producing images depicting "a photo of a cat". To fill this gap, we propose Control-CLIP, a novel decoupled CLIP fine-tuning framework that enables the CLIP model to learn the meaning of category and style in a complement manner. With specially designed fine-tuning tasks on minimal data and a modified cross-attention mechanism, Control-CLIP can precisely guide the diffusion model to a specific domain. Moreover, the parameters of the diffusion model remain unchanged at all, preserving the original generation performance and diversity. Experiments across multiple domains confirm the effectiveness of our approach, particularly highlighting its robust plug-and-play capability in generating content with various specific styles.

- **Summary**: Accurate and efficient surgical robotic tool pose estimation is of fundamental significance to downstream applications such as augmented reality (AR) in surgical training and learning-based autonomous manipulation. While significant advancements have been made in pose estimation for humans and animals, it is still a challenge in surgical robotics due to the scarcity of published data. The relatively large absolute error of the da Vinci end effector kinematics and arduous calibration procedure make calibrated kinematics data collection expensive. Driven by this limitation, we collected a dataset, dubbed SurgPose, providing instance-aware semantic keypoints and skeletons for visual surgical tool pose estimation and tracking. By marking keypoints using ultraviolet (UV) reactive paint, which is invisible under white light and fluorescent under UV light, we execute the same trajectory under different lighting conditions to collect raw videos and keypoint annotations, respectively. The SurgPose dataset consists of approximately 120k surgical instrument instances (80k for training and 40k for validation) of 6 categories. Each instrument instance is labeled with 7 semantic keypoints. Since the videos are collected in stereo pairs, the 2D pose can be lifted to 3D based on stereo-matching depth. In addition to releasing the dataset, we test a few baseline approaches to surgical instrument tracking to demonstrate the utility of SurgPose. More details can be found at surgpose.github.io.

- **Summary**: Anomaly Detection is a crucial step for critical applications such in the industrial, medical or cybersecurity domains. These sectors share the same requirement of handling differently the different types of classification errors. Indeed, even if false positives are acceptable, false negatives are not, because it would reflect a missed detection of a quality issue, a disease or a cyber threat. To fulfill this requirement, we propose a method that dynamically applies a trustworthy approximated partial AUC ROC loss (tapAUC). A binary classifier is trained to optimize the specific range of the AUC ROC curve that prevents the True Positive Rate (TPR) to reach 100% while minimizing the False Positive Rate (FPR). The optimal threshold that does not trigger any false negative is then kept and used at the test step. The results show a TPR of 92.52% at a 20.43% FPR for an average across 6 datasets, representing a TPR improvement of 4.3% for a FPR cost of 12.2% against other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In the era of the metaverse, where immersive technologies redefine human experiences, translating abstract literary concepts into navigable 3D environments presents a fundamental challenge in preserving semantic and emotional fidelity. This research introduces HaikuVerse, a novel framework for transforming poetic abstraction into spatial representation, with Japanese Haiku serving as an ideal test case due to its sophisticated encapsulation of profound emotions and imagery within minimal text. While existing text-to-3D methods struggle with nuanced interpretations, we present a literary-guided approach that synergizes traditional poetry analysis with advanced generative technologies. Our framework centers on two key innovations: (1) Hierarchical Literary-Criticism Theory Grounded Parsing (H-LCTGP), which captures both explicit imagery and implicit emotional resonance through structured semantic decomposition, and (2) Progressive Dimensional Synthesis (PDS), a multi-stage pipeline that systematically transforms poetic elements into coherent 3D scenes through sequential diffusion processes, geometric optimization, and real-time enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HaikuVerse significantly outperforms conventional text-to-3D approaches in both literary fidelity and visual quality, establishing a new paradigm for preserving cultural heritage in immersive digital spaces.

- **Summary**: Enhancing the fine-grained instance spatiotemporal motion perception capabilities of Video Large Language Models is crucial for improving their temporal and general video understanding. However, current models struggle to perceive detailed and complex instance motions. To address these challenges, we have made improvements from both data and model perspectives. In terms of data, we have meticulously curated iMOVE-IT, the first large-scale instance-motion-aware video instruction-tuning dataset. This dataset is enriched with comprehensive instance motion annotations and spatiotemporal mutual-supervision tasks, providing extensive training for the model's instance-motion-awareness. Building on this foundation, we introduce iMOVE, an instance-motion-aware video foundation model that utilizes Event-aware Spatiotemporal Efficient Modeling to retain informative instance spatiotemporal motion details while maintaining computational efficiency. It also incorporates Relative Spatiotemporal Position Tokens to ensure awareness of instance spatiotemporal positions. Evaluations indicate that iMOVE excels not only in video temporal understanding and general video understanding but also demonstrates significant advantages in long-term video understanding.

- **Summary**: Static LiDAR scanners produce accurate, dense, colored point clouds, but often contain obtrusive artifacts which makes them ill-suited for direct display. We propose an efficient method to render photorealistic images of such scans without any expensive preprocessing or training of a scene-specific model. A naive projection of the point cloud to the output view using 1x1 pixels is fast and retains the available detail, but also results in unintelligible renderings as background points leak in between the foreground pixels. The key insight is that these projections can be transformed into a realistic result using a deep convolutional model in the form of a U-Net, and a depth-based heuristic that prefilters the data. The U-Net also handles LiDAR-specific problems such as missing parts due to occlusion, color inconsistencies and varying point densities. We also describe a method to generate synthetic training data to deal with imperfectly-aligned ground truth images. Our method achieves real-time rendering rates using an off-the-shelf GPU and outperforms the state-of-the-art in both speed and quality.

  Diffusion Models. In Proceedings of VISAPP 2025, ISBN 978-989-758-728-3, ISSN
  2184-4321, pages 439-446
- **Summary**: The rise of generative image models leads to privacy concerns when it comes to the huge datasets used to train such models. This paper investigates the possibility of inferring if a set of face images was used for fine-tuning a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) method is presented for this task. Using generated auxiliary data for the training of the attack model leads to significantly better performance, and so does the use of watermarks. The guidance scale used for inference was found to have a significant influence. If a LDM is fine-tuned for long enough, the text prompt used for inference has no significant influence. The proposed MIA is found to be viable in a realistic black-box setup against LDMs fine-tuned on face-images.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial in AI-driven medical imaging to ensure reliability and safety by identifying inputs outside a model's training distribution. Existing methods often require retraining or modifications to pre-trained models, which is impractical for clinical applications. This study introduces a post-hoc normalizing flow-based approach that seamlessly integrates with pre-trained models. By leveraging normalizing flows, it estimates the likelihood of feature vectors extracted from pre-trained models, capturing semantically meaningful representations without relying on pixel-level statistics. The method was evaluated using the MedMNIST benchmark and a newly curated MedOOD dataset simulating clinically relevant distributional shifts. Performance was measured using standard OOD detection metrics (e.g., AUROC, FPR@95, AUPR_IN, AUPR_OUT), with statistical analyses comparing it against ten baseline methods. On MedMNIST, the proposed model achieved an AUROC of 93.80%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. On MedOOD, it achieved an AUROC of 84.61%, demonstrating superior performance against other methods. Its post-hoc nature ensures compatibility with existing clinical workflows, addressing the limitations of previous approaches.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce GaussianMotion, a novel human rendering model that generates fully animatable scenes aligned with textual descriptions using Gaussian Splatting. Although existing methods achieve reasonable text-to-3D generation of human bodies using various 3D representations, they often face limitations in fidelity and efficiency, or primarily focus on static models with limited pose control. In contrast, our method generates fully animatable 3D avatars by combining deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting with text-to-3D score distillation, achieving high fidelity and efficient rendering for arbitrary poses. By densely generating diverse random poses during optimization, our deformable 3D human model learns to capture a wide range of natural motions distilled from a pose-conditioned diffusion model in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Score Distillation that effectively balances realistic detail and smoothness to achieve optimal 3D results. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by producing high-quality textures in both static and animated results, and by generating diverse 3D human models from various textual inputs.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown great promise in medical applications, particularly in visual question answering (MedVQA) and diagnosis from medical images. However, existing datasets and models often fail to consider critical aspects of medical diagnostics, such as the integration of historical records and the analysis of disease progression over time. In this paper, we introduce MMXU (Multimodal and MultiX-ray Understanding), a novel dataset for MedVQA that focuses on identifying changes in specific regions between two patient visits. Unlike previous datasets that primarily address single-image questions, MMXU enables multi-image questions, incorporating both current and historical patient data. We demonstrate the limitations of current LVLMs in identifying disease progression on MMXU-\textit{test}, even those that perform well on traditional benchmarks. To address this, we propose a MedRecord-Augmented Generation (MAG) approach, incorporating both global and regional historical records. Our experiments show that integrating historical records significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy by at least 20\%, bridging the gap between current LVLMs and human expert performance. Additionally, we fine-tune models with MAG on MMXU-\textit{dev}, which demonstrates notable improvements. We hope this work could illuminate the avenue of advancing the use of LVLMs in medical diagnostics by emphasizing the importance of historical context in interpreting medical images.

- **Summary**: Accurate and flexible world models are crucial for autonomous systems to understand their environment and predict future events. Object-centric models, with structured latent spaces, have shown promise in modeling object dynamics and interactions, but often face challenges in scaling to complex datasets and incorporating external guidance, limiting their applicability in robotics. To address these limitations, we propose TextOCVP, an object-centric model for image-to-video generation guided by textual descriptions. TextOCVP parses an observed scene into object representations, called slots, and utilizes a text-conditioned transformer predictor to forecast future object states and video frames. Our approach jointly models object dynamics and interactions while incorporating textual guidance, thus leading to accurate and controllable predictions. Our method's structured latent space offers enhanced control over the prediction process, outperforming several image-to-video generative baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured object-centric representations provide superior controllability and interpretability, facilitating the modeling of object dynamics and enabling more precise and understandable predictions. Videos and code are available at https://play-slot.github.io/TextOCVP/.

- **Summary**: World models that forecast environmental changes from actions are vital for autonomous driving models with strong generalization. The prevailing driving world model mainly build on video prediction model. Although these models can produce high-fidelity video sequences with advanced diffusion-based generator, they are constrained by their predictive duration and overall generalization capabilities. In this paper, we explore to solve this problem by combining generation loss with MAE-style feature-level context learning. In particular, we instantiate this target with three key design: (1) A more scalable Diffusion Transformer (DiT) structure trained with extra mask construction task. (2) we devise diffusion-related mask tokens to deal with the fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction and generative diffusion process. (3) we extend mask construction task to spatial-temporal domain by utilizing row-wise mask for shifted self-attention rather than masked self-attention in MAE. Then, we adopt a row-wise cross-view module to align with this mask design. Based on above improvement, we propose MaskGWM: a Generalizable driving World Model embodied with Video Mask reconstruction. Our model contains two variants: MaskGWM-long, focusing on long-horizon prediction, and MaskGWM-mview, dedicated to multi-view generation. Comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which contain normal validation of Nuscene dataset, long-horizon rollout of OpenDV-2K dataset and zero-shot validation of Waymo dataset. Quantitative metrics on these datasets show our method notably improving state-of-the-art driving world model.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present MVTokenFlow for high-quality 4D content creation from monocular videos. Recent advancements in generative models such as video diffusion models and multiview diffusion models enable us to create videos or 3D models. However, extending these generative models for dynamic 4D content creation is still a challenging task that requires the generated content to be consistent spatially and temporally. To address this challenge, MVTokenFlow utilizes the multiview diffusion model to generate multiview images on different timesteps, which attains spatial consistency across different viewpoints and allows us to reconstruct a reasonable coarse 4D field. Then, MVTokenFlow further regenerates all the multiview images using the rendered 2D flows as guidance. The 2D flows effectively associate pixels from different timesteps and improve the temporal consistency by reusing tokens in the regeneration process. Finally, the regenerated images are spatiotemporally consistent and utilized to refine the coarse 4D field to get a high-quality 4D field. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and show significantly improved quality than baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Through experimental studies, however, we observed the instability of final predicted quality scores, which change significantly over different viewpoint settings. Inspired by the "wooden barrel theory", given the default content-independent viewpoints of existing projection-related PCQA approaches, this paper presents a novel content-aware viewpoint generation network (CAVGN) to learn better viewpoints by taking the distribution of geometric and attribute features of degraded point clouds into consideration. Firstly, the proposed CAVGN extracts multi-scale geometric and texture features of the entire input point cloud, respectively. Then, for each default content-independent viewpoint, the extracted geometric and texture features are refined to focus on its corresponding visible part of the input point cloud. Finally, the refined geometric and texture features are concatenated to generate an optimized viewpoint. To train the proposed CAVGN, we present a self-supervised viewpoint ranking network (SSVRN) to select the viewpoint with the worst quality projected image to construct a default-optimized viewpoint dataset, which consists of thousands of paired default viewpoints and corresponding optimized viewpoints. Experimental results show that the projection-related PCQA methods can achieve higher performance using the viewpoints generated by the proposed CAVGN.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection is critical in industrial manufacturing for ensuring product quality and improving efficiency in automated processes. The scarcity of anomalous samples limits traditional detection methods, making anomaly generation essential for expanding the data repository. However, recent generative models often produce unrealistic anomalies increasing false positives, or require real-world anomaly samples for training. In this work, we treat anomaly generation as a compositional problem and propose ComGEN, a component-aware and unsupervised framework that addresses the gap in logical anomaly generation. Our method comprises a multi-component learning strategy to disentangle visual components, followed by subsequent generation editing procedures. Disentangled text-to-component pairs, revealing intrinsic logical constraints, conduct attention-guided residual mapping and model training with iteratively matched references across multiple scales. Experiments on the MVTecLOCO dataset confirm the efficacy of ComGEN, achieving the best AUROC score of 91.2%. Additional experiments on the real-world scenario of Diesel Engine and widely-used MVTecAD dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements when integrating simulated anomalies generated by ComGEN into automated production workflows.

- **Summary**: The evaluation of factual accuracy in large vision language models (LVLMs) has lagged behind their rapid development, making it challenging to fully reflect these models' knowledge capacity and reliability. In this paper, we introduce the first factuality-based visual question-answering benchmark in Chinese, named ChineseSimpleVQA, aimed at assessing the visual factuality of LVLMs across 8 major topics and 56 subtopics. The key features of this benchmark include a focus on the Chinese language, diverse knowledge types, a multi-hop question construction, high-quality data, static consistency, and easy-to-evaluate through short answers. Moreover, we contribute a rigorous data construction pipeline and decouple the visual factuality into two parts: seeing the world (i.e., object recognition) and discovering knowledge. This decoupling allows us to analyze the capability boundaries and execution mechanisms of LVLMs. Subsequently, we evaluate 34 advanced open-source and closed-source models, revealing critical performance gaps within this field.

- **Summary**: Ophthalmologists typically require multimodal data sources to improve diagnostic accuracy in clinical decisions. However, due to medical device shortages, low-quality data and data privacy concerns, missing data modalities are common in real-world scenarios. Existing deep learning methods tend to address it by learning an implicit latent subspace representation for different modality combinations. We identify two significant limitations of these methods: (1) implicit representation constraints that hinder the model's ability to capture modality-specific information and (2) modality heterogeneity, causing distribution gaps and redundancy in feature representations. To address these, we propose an Incomplete Modality Disentangled Representation (IMDR) strategy, which disentangles features into explicit independent modal-common and modal-specific features by guidance of mutual information, distilling informative knowledge and enabling it to reconstruct valuable missing semantics and produce robust multimodal representations. Furthermore, we introduce a joint proxy learning module that assists IMDR in eliminating intra-modality redundancy by exploiting the extracted proxies from each class. Experiments on four ophthalmology multimodal datasets demonstrate that the proposed IMDR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly.

- **Summary**: Measuring perceptual similarity is a key tool in computer vision. In recent years perceptual metrics based on features extracted from neural networks with large and diverse training sets, e.g. CLIP, have become popular. At the same time, the metrics extracted from features of neural networks are not adversarially robust. In this paper we show that adversarially robust CLIP models, called R-CLIP$_\textrm{F}$, obtained by unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning induce a better and adversarially robust perceptual metric that outperforms existing metrics in a zero-shot setting, and further matches the performance of state-of-the-art metrics while being robust after fine-tuning. Moreover, our perceptual metric achieves strong performance on related tasks such as robust image-to-image retrieval, which becomes especially relevant when applied to "Not Safe for Work" (NSFW) content detection and dataset filtering. While standard perceptual metrics can be easily attacked by a small perturbation completely degrading NSFW detection, our robust perceptual metric maintains high accuracy under an attack while having similar performance for unperturbed images. Finally, perceptual metrics induced by robust CLIP models have higher interpretability: feature inversion can show which images are considered similar, while text inversion can find what images are associated to a given prompt. This also allows us to visualize the very rich visual concepts learned by a CLIP model, including memorized persons, paintings and complex queries.

- **Summary**: Geometry quality assessment (GQA) of colorless point clouds is crucial for evaluating the performance of emerging point cloud-based solutions (e.g., watermarking, compression, and 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction). Unfortunately, existing objective GQA approaches are traditional full-reference metrics, whereas state-of-the-art learning-based point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) methods target both color and geometry distortions, neither of which are qualified for the no-reference GQA task. In addition, the lack of large-scale GQA datasets with subjective scores, which are always imprecise, biased, and inconsistent, also hinders the development of learning-based GQA metrics. Driven by these limitations, this paper proposes a no-reference geometry-only quality assessment approach based on list-wise rank learning, termed LRL-GQA, which comprises of a geometry quality assessment network (GQANet) and a list-wise rank learning network (LRLNet). The proposed LRL-GQA formulates the no-reference GQA as a list-wise rank problem, with the objective of directly optimizing the entire quality ordering. Specifically, a large dataset containing a variety of geometry-only distortions is constructed first, named LRL dataset, in which each sample is label-free but coupled with quality ranking information. Then, the GQANet is designed to capture intrinsic multi-scale patch-wise geometric features in order to predict a quality index for each point cloud. After that, the LRLNet leverages the LRL dataset and a likelihood loss to train the GQANet and ranks the input list of degraded point clouds according to their distortion levels. In addition, the pre-trained GQANet can be fine-tuned further to obtain absolute quality scores. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed no-reference LRL-GQA method compared with existing full-reference GQA metrics.

- **Summary**: Accurately restoring topology is both challenging and crucial in tubular structure extraction tasks, such as blood vessel segmentation and road network extraction. Diverging from traditional approaches based on pixel-level classification, our proposed method, named GraphMorph, focuses on branch-level features of tubular structures to achieve more topologically accurate predictions. GraphMorph comprises two main components: a Graph Decoder and a Morph Module. Utilizing multi-scale features extracted from an image patch by the segmentation network, the Graph Decoder facilitates the learning of branch-level features and generates a graph that accurately represents the tubular structure in this patch. The Morph Module processes two primary inputs: the graph and the centerline probability map, provided by the Graph Decoder and the segmentation network, respectively. Employing a novel SkeletonDijkstra algorithm, the Morph Module produces a centerline mask that aligns with the predicted graph. Furthermore, we observe that employing centerline masks predicted by GraphMorph significantly reduces false positives in the segmentation task, which is achieved by a simple yet effective post-processing strategy. The efficacy of our method in the centerline extraction and segmentation tasks has been substantiated through experimental evaluations across various datasets. Source code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Recent MLLMs have shown emerging visual understanding and reasoning abilities after being pre-trained on large-scale multimodal datasets. Unlike pre-training, where MLLMs receive rich visual-text alignment, instruction-tuning is often text-driven with weaker visual supervision, leading to the degradation of pre-trained visual understanding and causing visual forgetting. Existing approaches, such as direct fine-tuning and continual learning methods, fail to explicitly address this issue, often compressing visual representations and prioritizing task alignment over visual retention, which further worsens visual forgetting. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel perspective leveraging effective rank to quantify the degradation of visual representation richness, interpreting this degradation through the information bottleneck principle as excessive compression that leads to the degradation of crucial pre-trained visual knowledge. Building on this view, we propose a modality-decoupled gradient descent (MDGD) method that regulates gradient updates to maintain the effective rank of visual representations while mitigating the over-compression effects described by the information bottleneck. By explicitly disentangling the optimization of visual understanding from task-specific alignment, MDGD preserves pre-trained visual knowledge while enabling efficient task adaptation. To enable lightweight instruction-tuning, we further develop a memory-efficient fine-tuning approach using gradient masking, which selectively updates a subset of model parameters to enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), reducing computational overhead while preserving rich visual representations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks and backbone MLLMs demonstrate that MDGD effectively mitigates visual forgetting from pre-trained tasks while enabling strong adaptation to new tasks.

- **Summary**: Image-to-point cloud cross-modal Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a challenging task where the query is an RGB image, and the database samples are LiDAR point clouds. Compared to single-modal VPR, this approach benefits from the widespread availability of RGB cameras and the robustness of point clouds in providing accurate spatial geometry and distance information. However, current methods rely on intermediate modalities that capture either the vertical or horizontal field of view, limiting their ability to fully exploit the complementary information from both sensors. In this work, we propose an innovative initial retrieval + re-rank method that effectively combines information from range (or RGB) images and Bird's Eye View (BEV) images. Our approach relies solely on a computationally efficient global descriptor similarity search process to achieve re-ranking. Additionally, we introduce a novel similarity label supervision technique to maximize the utility of limited training data. Specifically, we employ points average distance to approximate appearance similarity and incorporate an adaptive margin, based on similarity differences, into the vanilla triplet loss. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Learning tool use from a single human demonstration video offers a highly intuitive and efficient approach to robot teaching. While humans can effortlessly generalize a demonstrated tool manipulation skill to diverse tools that support the same function (e.g., pouring with a mug versus a teapot), current one-shot imitation learning (OSIL) methods struggle to achieve this. A key challenge lies in establishing functional correspondences between demonstration and test tools, considering significant geometric variations among tools with the same function (i.e., intra-function variations). To address this challenge, we propose FUNCTO (Function-Centric OSIL for Tool Manipulation), an OSIL method that establishes function-centric correspondences with a 3D functional keypoint representation, enabling robots to generalize tool manipulation skills from a single human demonstration video to novel tools with the same function despite significant intra-function variations. With this formulation, we factorize FUNCTO into three stages: (1) functional keypoint extraction, (2) function-centric correspondence establishment, and (3) functional keypoint-based action planning. We evaluate FUNCTO against exiting modular OSIL methods and end-to-end behavioral cloning methods through real-robot experiments on diverse tool manipulation tasks. The results demonstrate the superiority of FUNCTO when generalizing to novel tools with intra-function geometric variations. More details are available at https://sites.google.com/view/functo.

- **Summary**: This work introduces ILIAS, a new test dataset for Instance-Level Image retrieval At Scale. It is designed to evaluate the ability of current and future foundation models and retrieval techniques to recognize particular objects. The key benefits over existing datasets include large scale, domain diversity, accurate ground truth, and a performance that is far from saturated. ILIAS includes query and positive images for 1,000 object instances, manually collected to capture challenging conditions and diverse domains. Large-scale retrieval is conducted against 100 million distractor images from YFCC100M. To avoid false negatives without extra annotation effort, we include only query objects confirmed to have emerged after 2014, i.e. the compilation date of YFCC100M. An extensive benchmarking is performed with the following observations: i) models fine-tuned on specific domains, such as landmarks or products, excel in that domain but fail on ILIAS ii) learning a linear adaptation layer using multi-domain class supervision results in performance improvements, especially for vision-language models iii) local descriptors in retrieval re-ranking are still a key ingredient, especially in the presence of severe background clutter iv) the text-to-image performance of the vision-language foundation models is surprisingly close to the corresponding image-to-image case. website: https://vrg.fel.cvut.cz/ilias/

- **Summary**: Joint low-rank and sparse unrolling networks have shown superior performance in dynamic MRI reconstruction. However, existing works mainly utilized matrix low-rank priors, neglecting the tensor characteristics of dynamic MRI images, and only a global threshold is applied for the sparse constraint to the multi-channel data, limiting the flexibility of the network. Additionally, most of them have inherently complex network structure, with intricate interactions among variables. In this paper, we propose a novel deep unrolling network, JotlasNet, for dynamic MRI reconstruction by jointly utilizing tensor low-rank and attention-based sparse priors. Specifically, we utilize tensor low-rank prior to exploit the structural correlations in high-dimensional data. Convolutional neural networks are used to adaptively learn the low-rank and sparse transform domains. A novel attention-based soft thresholding operator is proposed to assign a unique learnable threshold to each channel of the data in the CNN-learned sparse domain. The network is unrolled from the elaborately designed composite splitting algorithm and thus features a simple yet efficient parallel structure. Extensive experiments on two datasets (OCMR, CMRxRecon) demonstrate the superior performance of JotlasNet in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation for language tasks, they are not specifically designed for multimodal challenges. Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), however, is resource-intensive and constrained by various training limitations. In this paper, we propose the Modular-based Visual Contrastive Decoding (MVCD) framework to move this obstacle. Our framework leverages LLMs' In-Context Learning (ICL) capability and the proposed visual contrastive-example decoding (CED), specifically tailored for this framework, without requiring any additional training. By converting visual signals into text and focusing on contrastive output distributions during decoding, we can highlight the new information introduced by contextual examples, explore their connections, and avoid over-reliance on prior encoded knowledge. MVCD enhances LLMs' visual perception to make it see and reason over the input visuals. To demonstrate MVCD's effectiveness, we conduct experiments with four LLMs across five question answering datasets. Our results not only show consistent improvement in model accuracy but well explain the effective components inside our decoding strategy. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Pbhgit/MVCD.

The exact way in which the Fisher Information is computed is however rarely described, and multiple different implementations for it can be found online. This blog post discusses and empirically compares several often-used implementations, which highlights that many currently reported results for EWC could likely be improved by changing the way the Fisher Information is computed.

- **Summary**: Deepfake technology utilizes deep learning based face manipulation techniques to seamlessly replace faces in videos creating highly realistic but artificially generated content. Although this technology has beneficial applications in media and entertainment misuse of its capabilities may lead to serious risks including identity theft cyberbullying and false information. The integration of DL with visual cognition has resulted in important technological improvements particularly in addressing privacy risks caused by artificially generated deepfake images on digital media platforms. In this study we propose an efficient and lightweight method for detecting deepfake images and videos making it suitable for devices with limited computational resources. In order to reduce the computational burden usually associated with DL models our method integrates machine learning classifiers in combination with keyframing approaches and texture analysis. Moreover the features extracted with a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) local binary pattern (LBP) and KAZE bands were integrated to evaluate using random forest extreme gradient boosting extra trees and support vector classifier algorithms. Our findings show a feature-level fusion of HOG LBP and KAZE features improves accuracy to 92% and 96% on FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DFv2 respectively.

To enhance its reasoning abilities, we develop a reasoning-intensive dataset featuring challenging audio-visual questions with step-by-step solutions. We also propose process direct preference optimization (pDPO), which leverages contrastive step selection to achieve efficient step-level reward modelling tailored for multimodal inputs. Additionally, we introduce RivaBench, the first reasoning-intensive video understanding benchmark, featuring over 4,000 high-quality, expert-curated question-answer pairs across scenarios such as standup comedy, academic presentations, and synthetic video detection. video-SALMONN-o1 achieves 3-8% accuracy improvements over the LLaVA-OneVision baseline across different video reasoning benchmarks. Besides, pDPO achieves 6-8% improvements compared to the supervised fine-tuning model on RivaBench. Enhanced reasoning enables video-SALMONN-o1 zero-shot synthetic video detection capabilities.

  Estimation with Latent Space Features. Biomimetics 2024, 9, 747
- **Summary**: Depth estimation plays a pivotal role in advancing human-robot interactions, especially in indoor environments where accurate 3D scene reconstruction is essential for tasks like navigation and object handling. Monocular depth estimation, which relies on a single RGB camera, offers a more affordable solution compared to traditional methods that use stereo cameras or LiDAR. However, despite recent progress, many monocular approaches struggle with accurately defining depth boundaries, leading to less precise reconstructions. In response to these challenges, this study introduces a novel depth estimation framework that leverages latent space features within a deep convolutional neural network to enhance the precision of monocular depth maps. The proposed model features dual encoder-decoder architecture, enabling both color-to-depth and depth-to-depth transformations. This structure allows for refined depth estimation through latent space encoding. To further improve the accuracy of depth boundaries and local features, a new loss function is introduced. This function combines latent loss with gradient loss, helping the model maintain the integrity of depth boundaries. The framework is thoroughly tested using the NYU Depth V2 dataset, where it sets a new benchmark, particularly excelling in complex indoor scenarios. The results clearly show that this approach effectively reduces depth ambiguities and blurring, making it a promising solution for applications in human-robot interaction and 3D scene reconstruction.

- **Summary**: When performing 3D inpainting using novel-view rendering methods like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), how to achieve texture and geometry consistency across camera views has been a challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework of 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency (3DGIC) for cross-view consistent 3D inpainting. Guided by the rendered depth information from each training view, our 3DGIC exploits background pixels visible across different views for updating the inpainting mask, allowing us to refine the 3DGS for inpainting purposes.Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we confirm that our 3DGIC outperforms current state-of-the-art 3D inpainting methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often exhibit biases toward certain categories during object recognition, even under balanced training data conditions. The intrinsic mechanisms underlying these biases remain unclear. Inspired by the human visual system, which decouples object manifolds through hierarchical processing to achieve object recognition, we propose a geometric analysis framework linking the geometric complexity of class-specific perceptual manifolds in DNNs to model bias. Our findings reveal that differences in geometric complexity can lead to varying recognition capabilities across categories, introducing biases. To support this analysis, we present the Perceptual-Manifold-Geometry library, designed for calculating the geometric properties of perceptual manifolds.

- **Summary**: We investigate the emergence of intuitive physics understanding in general-purpose deep neural network models trained to predict masked regions in natural videos. Leveraging the violation-of-expectation framework, we find that video prediction models trained to predict outcomes in a learned representation space demonstrate an understanding of various intuitive physics properties, such as object permanence and shape consistency. In contrast, video prediction in pixel space and multimodal large language models, which reason through text, achieve performance closer to chance. Our comparisons of these architectures reveal that jointly learning an abstract representation space while predicting missing parts of sensory input, akin to predictive coding, is sufficient to acquire an understanding of intuitive physics, and that even models trained on one week of unique video achieve above chance performance. This challenges the idea that core knowledge -- a set of innate systems to help understand the world -- needs to be hardwired to develop an understanding of intuitive physics.

- **Summary**: Chord recognition serves as a critical task in music information retrieval due to the abstract and descriptive nature of chords in music analysis. While audio chord recognition systems have achieved significant accuracy for small vocabularies (e.g., major/minor chords), large-vocabulary chord recognition remains a challenging problem. This complexity also arises from the inherent long-tail distribution of chords, where rare chord types are underrepresented in most datasets, leading to insufficient training samples. Effective chord recognition requires leveraging contextual information from audio sequences, yet existing models, such as combinations of convolutional neural networks, bidirectional long short-term memory networks, and bidirectional transformers, face limitations in capturing long-term dependencies and exhibit suboptimal performance on large-vocabulary chord recognition tasks. This work proposes ChordFormer, a novel conformer-based architecture designed to tackle structural chord recognition (e.g., triads, bass, sevenths) for large vocabularies. ChordFormer leverages conformer blocks that integrate convolutional neural networks with transformers, thus enabling the model to capture both local patterns and global dependencies effectively. By addressing challenges such as class imbalance through a reweighted loss function and structured chord representations, ChordFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving a 2% improvement in frame-wise accuracy and a 6% increase in class-wise accuracy on large-vocabulary chord datasets. Furthermore, ChordFormer excels in handling class imbalance, providing robust and balanced recognition across chord types. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical music knowledge and practical applications, advancing the field of large-vocabulary chord recognition.

- **Summary**: Time Series Motif Discovery (TSMD) identifies repeating patterns in time series data, but its unsupervised nature might result in motifs that are not interesting to the user. To address this, we propose a framework that allows the user to impose constraints on the motifs to be discovered, where constraints can easily be defined according to the properties of the desired motifs in the application domain. We also propose an efficient implementation of the framework, the LoCoMotif-DoK algorithm. We demonstrate that LoCoMotif-DoK can effectively leverage domain knowledge in real and synthetic data, outperforming other TSMD techniques which only support a limited form of domain knowledge.

- **Summary**: While audio-visual learning equips models with a richer understanding of the real world by leveraging multiple sensory modalities, this integration also introduces new vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.   In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the adversarial robustness of audio-visual models, considering both temporal and modality-specific vulnerabilities. We propose two powerful adversarial attacks: 1) a temporal invariance attack that exploits the inherent temporal redundancy across consecutive time segments and 2) a modality misalignment attack that introduces incongruence between the audio and visual modalities. These attacks are designed to thoroughly assess the robustness of audio-visual models against diverse threats. Furthermore, to defend against such attacks, we introduce a novel audio-visual adversarial training framework. This framework addresses key challenges in vanilla adversarial training by incorporating efficient adversarial perturbation crafting tailored to multi-modal data and an adversarial curriculum strategy. Extensive experiments in the Kinetics-Sounds dataset demonstrate that our proposed temporal and modality-based attacks in degrading model performance can achieve state-of-the-art performance, while our adversarial training defense largely improves the adversarial robustness as well as the adversarial training efficiency.

- **Summary**: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences underscores the hierarchical nature of cognitive capabilities. To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.

- **Summary**: Agents in real-world scenarios like automated driving deal with uncertainty in their environment, in particular due to perceptual uncertainty. Although, reinforcement learning is dedicated to autonomous decision-making under uncertainty these algorithms are typically not informed about the uncertainty currently contained in their environment. On the other hand, uncertainty estimation for perception itself is typically directly evaluated in the perception domain, e.g., in terms of false positive detection rates or calibration errors based on camera images. Its use for deciding on goal-oriented actions remains largely unstudied. In this paper, we investigate how an agent's behavior is influenced by an uncertain perception and how this behavior changes if information about this uncertainty is available. Therefore, we consider a proxy task, where the agent is rewarded for driving a route as fast as possible without colliding with other road users. For controlled experiments, we introduce uncertainty in the observation space by perturbing the perception of the given agent while informing the latter. Our experiments show that an unreliable observation space modeled by a perturbed perception leads to a defensive driving behavior of the agent. Furthermore, when adding the information about the current uncertainty directly to the observation space, the agent adapts to the specific situation and in general accomplishes its task faster while, at the same time, accounting for risks.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to identify novel object categories beyond their training data. While this flexibility represents a significant advancement, current approaches still rely on manually specified class names as input, creating an inherent bottleneck in real-world applications. This work proposes a Vocabulary-Free Semantic Segmentation pipeline, eliminating the need for predefined class vocabularies. Specifically, we address the chicken-and-egg problem where users need knowledge of all potential objects within a scene to identify them, yet the purpose of segmentation is often to discover these objects. The proposed approach leverages Vision-Language Models to automatically recognize objects and generate appropriate class names, aiming to solve the challenge of class specification and naming quality. Through extensive experiments on several public datasets, we highlight the crucial role of the text encoder in model performance, particularly when the image text classes are paired with generated descriptions. Despite the challenges introduced by the sensitivity of the segmentation text encoder to false negatives within the class tagging process, which adds complexity to the task, we demonstrate that our fully automated pipeline significantly enhances vocabulary-free segmentation accuracy across diverse real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Latent Frame Rate VAE (DLFR-VAE), a training-free paradigm that can make use of adaptive temporal compression in latent space. While existing video generative models apply fixed compression rates via pretrained VAE, we observe that real-world video content exhibits substantial temporal non-uniformity, with high-motion segments containing more information than static scenes. Based on this insight, DLFR-VAE dynamically adjusts the latent frame rate according to the content complexity. Specifically, DLFR-VAE comprises two core innovations: (1) A Dynamic Latent Frame Rate Scheduler that partitions videos into temporal chunks and adaptively determines optimal frame rates based on information-theoretic content complexity, and (2) A training-free adaptation mechanism that transforms pretrained VAE architectures into a dynamic VAE that can process features with variable frame rates. Our simple but effective DLFR-VAE can function as a plug-and-play module, seamlessly integrating with existing video generation models and accelerating the video generation process.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled the integration of multiple modalities, including texts and images, within the large language model (LLM) framework. However, texts and images are usually interconnected, forming a multimodal attributed graph (MMAG). It is underexplored how MLLMs can incorporate the relational information (\textit{i.e.}, graph structure) and semantic information (\textit{i.e.,} texts and images) on such graphs for multimodal comprehension and generation. In this paper, we propose GraphGPT-o, which supports omni-multimodal understanding and creation on MMAGs. We first comprehensively study linearization variants to transform semantic and structural information as input for MLLMs. Then, we propose a hierarchical aligner that enables deep graph encoding, bridging the gap between MMAGs and MLLMs. Finally, we explore the inference choices, adapting MLLM to interleaved text and image generation in graph scenarios. Extensive experiments on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Datasets and codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: In vision-language models (VLMs), prompt tuning has shown its effectiveness in adapting models to downstream tasks. However, learned prompts struggle to generalize to unseen classes, as they tend to overfit to the classes that are targeted during prompt tuning. Examining failure cases, we observed that learned prompts disrupt the semantics of unseen classes, generating text embeddings with incorrect semantic relationships among classes. To address this, we propose Similarity Alignment Regularization (SAR), which regularizes learnable prompts to preserve the semantic relationships among classes captured by hand-crafted prompts. Specifically, we first obtain novel classes related to base classes using ChatGPT-4o and utilize them as potential unseen classes during prompt tuning. Then, by targeting both base and novel classes, SAR aligns the similarity relationships among text embeddings generated by learnable prompts with the similarity relationships from hand-crafted prompts. Extensive experiments applying SAR to existing prompt tuning methods demonstrate its effectiveness in improving generalization to unseen classes.

- **Summary**: Augmented reality assembly guidance is essential for intelligent manufacturing and medical applications, requiring continuous measurement of the 6DoF poses of manipulated objects. Although current tracking methods have made significant advancements in accuracy and efficiency, they still face challenges in robustness when dealing with cluttered backgrounds, rotationally symmetric objects, and noisy sequences. In this paper, we first propose a robust contour-based pose tracking method that addresses error-prone contour correspondences and improves noise tolerance. It utilizes a fan-shaped search strategy to refine correspondences and models local contour shape and noise uncertainty as mixed probability distribution, resulting in a highly robust contour energy function. Secondly, we introduce a CPU-only strategy to better track rotationally symmetric objects and assist the contour-based method in overcoming local minima by exploring sparse interior correspondences. This is achieved by pre-sampling interior points from sparse viewpoint templates offline and using the DIS optical flow algorithm to compute their correspondences during tracking. Finally, we formulate a unified energy function to fuse contour and interior information, which is solvable using a re-weighted least squares algorithm. Experiments on public datasets and real scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art monocular tracking methods and can achieve more than 100 FPS using only a CPU.

- **Summary**: Image inversion is a fundamental task in generative models, aiming to map images back to their latent representations to enable downstream applications such as editing, restoration, and style transfer. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in image inversion techniques, focusing on two main paradigms: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion and diffusion model inversion. We categorize these techniques based on their optimization methods. For GAN inversion, we systematically classify existing methods into encoder-based approaches, latent optimization approaches, and hybrid approaches, analyzing their theoretical foundations, technical innovations, and practical trade-offs. For diffusion model inversion, we explore training-free strategies, fine-tuning methods, and the design of additional trainable modules, highlighting their unique advantages and limitations. Additionally, we discuss several popular downstream applications and emerging applications beyond image tasks, identifying current challenges and future research directions. By synthesizing the latest developments, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a valuable reference resource, promoting further advancements in the field of image inversion.

- **Summary**: Diffusion model-generated images can appear indistinguishable from authentic photographs, but these images often contain artifacts and implausibilities that reveal their AI-generated provenance. Given the challenge to public trust in media posed by photorealistic AI-generated images, we conducted a large-scale experiment measuring human detection accuracy on 450 diffusion-model generated images and 149 real images. Based on collecting 749,828 observations and 34,675 comments from 50,444 participants, we find that scene complexity of an image, artifact types within an image, display time of an image, and human curation of AI-generated images all play significant roles in how accurately people distinguish real from AI-generated images. Additionally, we propose a taxonomy characterizing artifacts often appearing in images generated by diffusion models. Our empirical observations and taxonomy offer nuanced insights into the capabilities and limitations of diffusion models to generate photorealistic images in 2024.

- **Summary**: Discrete image registration can be a strategy to reconstruct signals from samples corrupted by blur and noise. We examine superresolution and discrete image registration for one-dimensional spatially-limited piecewise constant functions which are subject to blur which is Gaussian or a mixture of Gaussians as well as to round-off errors. Previous approaches address the signal recovery problem as an optimization problem. We focus on a regime with low blur and suggest that the operations of blur, sampling, and quantization are not unlike the operation of a computer program and have an abstraction that can be studied with a type of logic. When the minimum distance between discontinuity points is between $1.5$ and 2 times the sampling interval, we can encounter the simplest form of a type of interference between discontinuity points that we call ``commingling.'' We describe a way to reason about two sets of samples of the same signal that will often result in the correct recovery of signal amplitudes. We also discuss ways to estimate bounds on the distances between discontinuity points.

- **Summary**: This study presents a unified deep learning (DL) framework, MultiFlowSeg, for classification and segmentation of velocity-encoded phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging data, and MultiFlowDTC for temporal clustering of flow phenotypes. Applied to the FORCE registry of Fontan procedure patients, MultiFlowSeg achieved 100% classification accuracy for the aorta, SVC, and IVC, and 94% for the LPA and RPA. It demonstrated robust segmentation with a median Dice score of 0.91 (IQR: 0.86-0.93). The automated pipeline processed registry data, achieving high segmentation success despite challenges like poor image quality and dextrocardia. Temporal clustering identified five distinct patient subgroups, with significant differences in clinical outcomes, including ejection fraction, exercise tolerance, liver disease, and mortality. These results demonstrate the potential of combining DL and time-varying flow data for improved CHD prognosis and personalized care.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in visual speech recognition (VSR) have promoted progress in lip-to-speech synthesis, where pre-trained VSR models enhance the intelligibility of synthesized speech by providing valuable semantic information. The success achieved by cascade frameworks, which combine pseudo-VSR with pseudo-text-to-speech (TTS) or implicitly utilize the transcribed text, highlights the benefits of leveraging VSR models. However, these methods typically rely on mel-spectrograms as an intermediate representation, which may introduce a key bottleneck: the domain gap between synthetic mel-spectrograms, generated from inherently error-prone lip-to-speech mappings, and real mel-spectrograms used to train vocoders. This mismatch inevitably degrades synthesis quality. To bridge this gap, we propose Natural Lip-to-Speech (NaturalL2S), an end-to-end framework integrating acoustic inductive biases with differentiable speech generation components. Specifically, we introduce a fundamental frequency (F0) predictor to capture prosodic variations in synthesized speech. The predicted F0 then drives a Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) synthesizer to generate a coarse signal which serves as prior information for subsequent speech synthesis. Additionally, instead of relying on a reference speaker embedding as an auxiliary input, our approach achieves satisfactory performance on speaker similarity without explicitly modelling speaker characteristics. Both objective and subjective evaluation results demonstrate that NaturalL2S can effectively enhance the quality of the synthesized speech when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recent research has demonstrated the potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) to accurately predict next-day wildfire spread, based upon the current extent of a fire and geospatial rasters of influential environmental covariates e.g., vegetation, topography, climate, and weather. In this work, we investigate a recent transformer-based model, termed the SwinUnet, for next-day wildfire prediction. We benchmark Swin-based models against several current state-of-the-art models on WildfireSpreadTS (WFTS), a large public benchmark dataset of historical wildfire events. We consider two next-day fire prediction scenarios: when the model is given input of (i) a single previous day of data, or (ii) five previous days of data. We find that, with the proper modifications, SwinUnet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on next-day prediction for both the single-day and multi-day scenarios. SwinUnet's success depends heavily upon utilizing pre-trained weights from ImageNet. Consistent with prior work, we also found that models with multi-day-input always outperformed models with single-day input.

- **Summary**: Object pose estimation of transparent objects remains a challenging task in the field of robot vision due to the immense influence of lighting, background, and reflections. However, the edges of clear objects have the highest contrast, which leads to stable and prominent features. We propose a novel approach by incorporating edge detection in a pre-processing step for the tasks of object detection and object pose estimation. We conducted experiments to investigate the effect of edge detectors on transparent objects. We examine the performance of the state-of-the-art 6D object pose estimation pipeline GDR-Net and the object detector YOLOX when applying different edge detectors as pre-processing steps (i.e., Canny edge detection with and without color information, and holistically-nested edges (HED)). We evaluate the physically-based rendered dataset Trans6D-32 K of transparent objects with parameters proposed by the BOP Challenge. Our results indicate that applying edge detection as a pre-processing enhances performance for certain objects.

- **Summary**: While previous single-view-based 3D human reconstruction methods made significant progress in novel view synthesis, it remains a challenge to synthesize both view-consistent and pose-consistent results for animatable human avatars from a single image input. Motivated by the success of 2D character animation, we propose <strong>HumanGif</strong>, a single-view human diffusion model with generative prior. Specifically, we formulate the single-view-based 3D human novel view and pose synthesis as a single-view-conditioned human diffusion process, utilizing generative priors from foundational diffusion models. To ensure fine-grained and consistent novel view and pose synthesis, we introduce a Human NeRF module in HumanGif to learn spatially aligned features from the input image, implicitly capturing the relative camera and human pose transformation. Furthermore, we introduce an image-level loss during optimization to bridge the gap between latent and image spaces in diffusion models. Extensive experiments on RenderPeople and DNA-Rendering datasets demonstrate that HumanGif achieves the best perceptual performance, with better generalizability for novel view and pose synthesis.

- **Summary**: In the pursuit of superior video-processing MLLMs, we have encountered a perplexing paradox: the "anti-scaling law", where more data and larger models lead to worse performance. This study unmasks the culprit: "temporal hacking", a phenomenon where models shortcut by fixating on select frames, missing the full video narrative. In this work, we systematically establish a comprehensive theory of temporal hacking, defining it from a reinforcement learning perspective, introducing the Temporal Perplexity (TPL) score to assess this misalignment, and proposing the Unhackable Temporal Rewarding (UTR) framework to mitigate the temporal hacking. Both theoretically and empirically, TPL proves to be a reliable indicator of temporal modeling quality, correlating strongly with frame activation patterns. Extensive experiments reveal that UTR not only counters temporal hacking but significantly elevates video comprehension capabilities. This work not only advances video-AI systems but also illuminates the critical importance of aligning proxy rewards with true objectives in MLLM development.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the possibility of learning custom tokens for representing new concepts in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our aim is to learn tokens that can be effective for both discriminative and generative tasks while composing well with words to form new input queries. The targeted concept is specified in terms of a small set of images and a parent concept described using text. We operate on CLIP text features and propose to use a combination of a textual inversion loss and a classification loss to ensure that text features of the learned token are aligned with image features of the concept in the CLIP embedding space. We restrict the learned token to a low-dimensional subspace spanned by tokens for attributes that are appropriate for the given super-class. These modifications improve the quality of compositions of the learned token with natural language for generating new scenes. Further, we show that learned custom tokens can be used to form queries for text-to-image retrieval task, and also have the important benefit that composite queries can be visualized to ensure that the desired concept is faithfully encoded. Based on this, we introduce the method of Generation Aided Image Retrieval, where the query is modified at inference time to better suit the search intent. On the DeepFashion2 dataset, our method improves Mean Reciprocal Retrieval (MRR) over relevant baselines by 7%.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a unified framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. We demonstrate the corresponding TokCom benefits in a GenSC setup for image, leveraging cross-modal context information, which increases the bandwidth efficiency by 70.8% with negligible loss of semantic/perceptual quality. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.

- **Summary**: Motion capture systems are a widespread tool in research to record ground-truth poses of objects. Commercial systems use reflective markers attached to the object and then triangulate pose of the object from multiple camera views. Consequently, the object must be visible to multiple cameras which makes such multi-view motion capture systems unsuited for deployments in narrow, confined spaces (e.g. ballast tanks of ships). In this technical report we describe a monocular event-camera motion capture system which overcomes this limitation and is ideally suited for narrow spaces. Instead of passive markers it relies on active, blinking LED markers such that each marker can be uniquely identified from the blinking frequency. The markers are placed at known locations on the tracking object. We then solve the PnP (perspective-n-points) problem to obtain the position and orientation of the object. The developed system has millimeter accuracy, millisecond latency and we demonstrate that its state estimate can be used to fly a small, agile quadrotor.

- **Summary**: Visual instruction tuning refines pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance their real-world task performance. However, the rapid expansion of visual instruction datasets introduces significant data redundancy, leading to excessive computational costs. Existing data selection methods predominantly rely on proxy models or loss-based metrics, both of which impose substantial computational overheads due to the necessity of model inference and backpropagation. To address this challenge, we propose PRISM, a novel training-free approach for efficient multimodal data selection. Unlike existing methods, PRISM eliminates the reliance on proxy models, warm-up pretraining, and gradient-based optimization. Instead, it leverages Pearson correlation analysis to quantify the intrinsic visual encoding properties of MLLMs, computing a task-specific correlation score to identify high-value instances. This not only enbles data-efficient selection,but maintains the original performance. Empirical evaluations across multiple MLLMs demonstrate that PRISM reduces the overall time required for visual instruction tuning and data selection to just 30% of conventional methods, while surpassing fully fine-tuned models across eight multimodal and three language understanding benchmarks, achieving a 101.7% relative improvement in final performance.

- **Summary**: With the explosive growth of 3D content creation, there is an increasing demand for automatically converting static 3D models into articulation-ready versions that support realistic animation. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual annotation, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, the lack of large-scale benchmarks has hindered the development of learning-based solutions. In this work, we present MagicArticulate, an effective framework that automatically transforms static 3D models into articulation-ready assets. Our key contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Articulation-XL, a large-scale benchmark containing over 33k 3D models with high-quality articulation annotations, carefully curated from Objaverse-XL. Second, we propose a novel skeleton generation method that formulates the task as a sequence modeling problem, leveraging an auto-regressive transformer to naturally handle varying numbers of bones or joints within skeletons and their inherent dependencies across different 3D models. Third, we predict skinning weights using a functional diffusion process that incorporates volumetric geodesic distance priors between vertices and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicArticulate significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse object categories, achieving high-quality articulation that enables realistic animation.

- **Summary**: We present FLARE, a feed-forward model designed to infer high-quality camera poses and 3D geometry from uncalibrated sparse-view images (i.e., as few as 2-8 inputs), which is a challenging yet practical setting in real-world applications. Our solution features a cascaded learning paradigm with camera pose serving as the critical bridge, recognizing its essential role in mapping 3D structures onto 2D image planes. Concretely, FLARE starts with camera pose estimation, whose results condition the subsequent learning of geometric structure and appearance, optimized through the objectives of geometry reconstruction and novel-view synthesis. Utilizing large-scale public datasets for training, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance in the tasks of pose estimation, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis, while maintaining the inference efficiency (i.e., less than 0.5 seconds).

- **Summary**: We propose Diffusion-Sharpening, a fine-tuning approach that enhances downstream alignment by optimizing sampling trajectories. Existing RL-based fine-tuning methods focus on single training timesteps and neglect trajectory-level alignment, while recent sampling trajectory optimization methods incur significant inference NFE costs. Diffusion-Sharpening overcomes this by using a path integral framework to select optimal trajectories during training, leveraging reward feedback, and amortizing inference costs. Our method demonstrates superior training efficiency with faster convergence, and best inference efficiency without requiring additional NFEs. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion-Sharpening outperforms RL-based fine-tuning methods (e.g., Diffusion-DPO) and sampling trajectory optimization methods (e.g., Inference Scaling) across diverse metrics including text alignment, compositional capabilities, and human preferences, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future diffusion model fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: The remarkable success of the autoregressive paradigm has made significant advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with powerful models like Show-o, Transfusion and Emu3 achieving notable progress in unified image understanding and generation. For the first time, we uncover a common phenomenon: the understanding capabilities of MLLMs are typically stronger than their generative capabilities, with a significant gap between the two. Building on this insight, we propose HermesFlow, a simple yet general framework designed to seamlessly bridge the gap between understanding and generation in MLLMs. Specifically, we take the homologous data as input to curate homologous preference data of both understanding and generation. Through Pair-DPO and self-play iterative optimization, HermesFlow effectively aligns multimodal understanding and generation using homologous preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over prior methods, particularly in narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation. These findings highlight the potential of HermesFlow as a general alignment framework for next-generation multimodal foundation models. Code: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/HermesFlow

- **Summary**: 3D volumetric video provides immersive experience and is gaining traction in digital media. Despite its rising popularity, the streaming of volumetric video content poses significant challenges due to the high data bandwidth requirement. A natural approach to mitigate the bandwidth issue is to reduce the volumetric video's data rate by downsampling the content prior to transmission. The video can then be upsampled at the receiver's end using a super-resolution (SR) algorithm to reconstruct the high-resolution details. While super-resolution techniques have been extensively explored and advanced for 2D video content, there is limited work on SR algorithms tailored for volumetric videos.   To address this gap and the growing need for efficient volumetric video streaming, we have developed VoLUT with a new SR algorithm specifically designed for volumetric content. Our algorithm uniquely harnesses the power of lookup tables (LUTs) to facilitate the efficient and accurate upscaling of low-resolution volumetric data. The use of LUTs enables our algorithm to quickly reference precomputed high-resolution values, thereby significantly reducing the computational complexity and time required for upscaling. We further apply adaptive video bit rate algorithm (ABR) to dynamically determine the downsampling rate according to the network condition and stream the selected video rate to the receiver. Compared to related work, VoLUT is the first to enable high-quality 3D SR on commodity mobile devices at line-rate. Our evaluation shows VoLUT can reduce bandwidth usage by 70% , boost QoE by 36.7% for volumetric video streaming and achieve   3D SR speed-up with no quality compromise.

- **Summary**: This paper presents Model-guidance (MG), a novel objective for training diffusion model that addresses and removes of the commonly used Classifier-free guidance (CFG). Our innovative approach transcends the standard modeling of solely data distribution to incorporating the posterior probability of conditions. The proposed technique originates from the idea of CFG and is easy yet effective, making it a plug-and-play module for existing models. Our method significantly accelerates the training process, doubles the inference speed, and achieve exceptional quality that parallel and even surpass concurrent diffusion models with CFG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, scalability on different models and datasets. Finally, we establish state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet 256 benchmarks with an FID of 1.34. Our code is available at https://github.com/tzco/Diffusion-wo-CFG.
