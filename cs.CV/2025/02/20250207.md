- **Summary**: Style transfer is adopted to synthesize appealing stylized images that preserve the structure of a content image but carry the pattern of a style image. Many recently proposed style transfer methods use only western oil paintings as style images to achieve image stylization. As a result, unnatural messy artistic effects are produced in stylized images when using these methods to directly transfer the patterns of traditional Chinese paintings, which are composed of plain colors and abstract objects. Moreover, most of them work only at the original image scale and thus ignore multiscale image information during training. In this paper, we present a novel effective multiscale style transfer method based on Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction, which can transfer unique patterns of Chinese paintings by learning different image features at different scales. In the first stage, the holistic patterns are transferred at low resolution by adopting a Style Transfer Base Network. Then, the details of the content and style are gradually enhanced at higher resolutions by a Detail Enhancement Network with an edge information selection (EIS) module in the second stage. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the generation of appealing high-quality stylization results and a comparison with some state-of-the-art style transfer methods.

- **Summary**: Prefracture method is a practical implementation for real-time object destruction that is hardly achievable within performance constraints, but can produce unrealistic results due to its heuristic nature. To mitigate it, we approach the clustering of prefractured mesh generation as an unordered segmentation on point cloud data, and propose leveraging the deep neural network trained on a physics-based dataset. Our novel paradigm successfully predicts the structural weakness of object that have been limited, exhibiting ready-to-use results with remarkable quality.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. In the mainstream modeling strategies, i.e., CNN and Transformer, the input images are treated as the equal-sized grid of pixels in the Euclidean space. They have limitations in facing remote sensing images with irregular ground objects. Graph is the more flexible structure, however, there are two major challenges when modeling spatial-spectral properties with graph: \emph{1) constructing the customized graph structure for spatial-spectral relationship priors}; \emph{2) learning the unified spatial-spectral representation through the graph}. To address these challenges, we propose the spatial-spectral heterogeneous graph learning network, named \textbf{HetSSNet}. Specifically, HetSSNet initially constructs the heterogeneous graph structure for pansharpening, which explicitly describes pansharpening-specific relationships. Subsequently, the basic relationship pattern generation module is designed to extract the multiple relationship patterns from the heterogeneous graph. Finally, relationship pattern aggregation module is exploited to collaboratively learn unified spatial-spectral representation across different relationships among nodes with adaptive importance learning from local and global perspectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority and generalization of HetSSNet.

- **Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising solution for reducing the storage and computational cost of vision transformers (ViTs). Recent advances primarily target at crafting quantizers to deal with peculiar activations characterized by ViTs. However, most existing methods underestimate the information loss incurred by weight quantization, resulting in significant performance deterioration, particularly in low-bit cases. Furthermore, a common practice in quantizing post-Softmax activations of ViTs is to employ logarithmic transformations, which unfortunately prioritize less informative values around zero. This approach introduces additional redundancies, ultimately leading to suboptimal quantization efficacy. To handle these, this paper proposes an innovative PTQ method tailored for ViTs, termed AIQViT (Architecture-Informed Post-training Quantization for ViTs). First, we design an architecture-informed low rank compensation mechanism, wherein learnable low-rank weights are introduced to compensate for the degradation caused by weight quantization. Second, we design a dynamic focusing quantizer to accommodate the unbalanced distribution of post-Softmax activations, which dynamically selects the most valuable interval for higher quantization resolution. Extensive experiments on five vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, point cloud classification, and point cloud part segmentation, demonstrate the superiority of AIQViT over state-of-the-art PTQ methods.

- **Summary**: Capturing and reconstructing high-speed dynamic 3D scenes has numerous applications in computer graphics, vision, and interdisciplinary fields such as robotics, aerodynamics, and evolutionary biology. However, achieving this using a single imaging modality remains challenging. For instance, traditional RGB cameras suffer from low frame rates, limited exposure times, and narrow baselines. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion approach using Gaussian splatting, which combines RGB, depth, and event cameras to capture and reconstruct deforming scenes at high speeds. The key insight of our method lies in leveraging the complementary strengths of these imaging modalities: RGB cameras capture detailed color information, event cameras record rapid scene changes with microsecond resolution, and depth cameras provide 3D scene geometry. To unify the underlying scene representation across these modalities, we represent the scene using deformable 3D Gaussians. To handle rapid scene movements, we jointly optimize the 3D Gaussian parameters and their temporal deformation fields by integrating data from all three sensor modalities. This fusion enables efficient, high-quality imaging of fast and complex scenes, even under challenging conditions such as low light, narrow baselines, or rapid motion. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets captured with our prototype sensor fusion setup demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving noticeable improvements in both rendering fidelity and structural accuracy.

- **Summary**: Street view imagery is extensively utilized in representation learning for urban visual environments, supporting various sustainable development tasks such as environmental perception and socio-economic assessment. However, it is challenging for existing image representations to specifically encode the dynamic urban environment (such as pedestrians, vehicles, and vegetation), the built environment (including buildings, roads, and urban infrastructure), and the environmental ambiance (such as the cultural and socioeconomic atmosphere) depicted in street view imagery to address downstream tasks related to the city. In this work, we propose an innovative self-supervised learning framework that leverages temporal and spatial attributes of street view imagery to learn image representations of the dynamic urban environment for diverse downstream tasks. By employing street view images captured at the same location over time and spatially nearby views at the same time, we construct contrastive learning tasks designed to learn the temporal-invariant characteristics of the built environment and the spatial-invariant neighborhood ambiance. Our approach significantly outperforms traditional supervised and unsupervised methods in tasks such as visual place recognition, socioeconomic estimation, and human-environment perception. Moreover, we demonstrate the varying behaviors of image representations learned through different contrastive learning objectives across various downstream tasks. This study systematically discusses representation learning strategies for urban studies based on street view images, providing a benchmark that enhances the applicability of visual data in urban science.

- **Summary**: Due to the effective multi-scale feature fusion capabilities of the Path Aggregation FPN (PAFPN), it has become a widely adopted component in YOLO-based detectors. However, PAFPN struggles to integrate high-level semantic cues with low-level spatial details, limiting its performance in real-world applications, especially with significant scale variations. In this paper, we propose MHAF-YOLO, a novel detection framework featuring a versatile neck design called the Multi-Branch Auxiliary FPN (MAFPN), which consists of two key modules: the Superficial Assisted Fusion (SAF) and Advanced Assisted Fusion (AAF). The SAF bridges the backbone and the neck by fusing shallow features, effectively transferring crucial low-level spatial information with high fidelity. Meanwhile, the AAF integrates multi-scale feature information at deeper neck layers, delivering richer gradient information to the output layer and further enhancing the model learning capacity. To complement MAFPN, we introduce the Global Heterogeneous Flexible Kernel Selection (GHFKS) mechanism and the Reparameterized Heterogeneous Multi-Scale (RepHMS) module to enhance feature fusion. RepHMS is globally integrated into the network, utilizing GHFKS to select larger convolutional kernels for various feature layers, expanding the vertical receptive field and capturing contextual information across spatial hierarchies. Locally, it optimizes convolution by processing both large and small kernels within the same layer, broadening the lateral receptive field and preserving crucial details for detecting smaller targets.

- **Summary**: While transformer-based models dominate NLP and vision applications, their underlying mechanisms to map the input space to the label space semantically are not well understood. In this paper, we study the sources of known representation vulnerabilities of vision transformers (ViT), where perceptually identical images can have very different representations and semantically unrelated images can have the same representation. Our analysis indicates that imperceptible changes to the input can result in significant representation changes, particularly in later layers, suggesting potential instabilities in the performance of ViTs. Our comprehensive study reveals that adversarial effects, while subtle in early layers, propagate and amplify through the network, becoming most pronounced in middle to late layers. This insight motivates the development of NeuroShield-ViT, a novel defense mechanism that strategically neutralizes vulnerable neurons in earlier layers to prevent the cascade of adversarial effects. We demonstrate NeuroShield-ViT's effectiveness across various attacks, particularly excelling against strong iterative attacks, and showcase its remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. Without fine-tuning, our method achieves a competitive accuracy of 77.8% on adversarial examples, surpassing conventional robustness methods. Our results shed new light on how adversarial effects propagate through ViT layers, while providing a promising approach to enhance the robustness of vision transformers against adversarial attacks. Additionally, they provide a promising approach to enhance the robustness of vision transformers against adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: Fingerprint recognition remains one of the most reliable biometric technologies due to its high accuracy and uniqueness. Traditional systems rely on contact-based scanners, which are prone to issues such as image degradation from surface contamination and inconsistent user interaction. To address these limitations, contactless fingerprint recognition has emerged as a promising alternative, providing non-intrusive and hygienic authentication. This study evaluates the impact of image enhancement tech-niques on the performance of pre-trained deep learning models using transfer learning for touchless fingerprint recognition. The IIT-Bombay Touchless and Touch-Based Fingerprint Database, containing data from 200 subjects, was employed to test the per-formance of deep learning architectures such as VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception-V3, and ResNet-50. Experimental results reveal that transfer learning methods with fingerprint image enhance-ment (indirect method) significantly outperform those without enhancement (direct method). Specifically, VGG-16 achieved an accuracy of 98% in training and 93% in testing when using the enhanced images, demonstrating superior performance compared to the direct method.   This paper provides a detailed comparison of the effectiveness of image enhancement in improving the accuracy of transfer learning models for touchless fingerprint recognition, offering key insights for developing more efficient biometric systems.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a powerful earth observation technology that captures and processes information across a wide spectrum of wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging provides comprehensive and detailed spectral data that is invaluable for a wide range of reconstruction problems. However due to complexity in analysis it often becomes difficult to handle this data. To address the challenge of handling large number of bands in reconstructing high quality HSI, we propose to form groups of bands. In this position paper we propose a method of selecting diverse bands using determinantal point processes in correlated bands. To address the issue of overlapping bands that may arise from grouping, we use spectral angle mapper analysis. This analysis can be fed to any Machine learning model to enable detailed analysis and monitoring with high precision and accuracy.

- **Summary**: Deep optics has emerged as a promising approach by co-designing optical elements with deep learning algorithms. However, current research typically overlooks the analysis and optimization of manufacturing and assembly tolerances. This oversight creates a significant performance gap between designed and fabricated optical systems. To address this challenge, we present the first end-to-end tolerance-aware optimization framework that incorporates multiple tolerance types into the deep optics design pipeline. Our method combines physics-informed modelling with data-driven training to enhance optical design by accounting for and compensating for structural deviations in manufacturing and assembly. We validate our approach through computational imaging applications, demonstrating results in both simulations and real-world experiments. We further examine how our proposed solution improves the robustness of optical systems and vision algorithms against tolerances through qualitative and quantitative analyses. Code and additional visual results are available at openimaginglab.github.io/LensTolerance.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models (DMs) in data generation, they exhibit specific failure cases with unsatisfactory outputs. We focus on one such limitation: the ability of DMs to learn hidden rules between image features. Specifically, for image data with dependent features ($\mathbf{x}$) and ($\mathbf{y}$) (e.g., the height of the sun ($\mathbf{x}$) and the length of the shadow ($\mathbf{y}$)), we investigate whether DMs can accurately capture the inter-feature rule ($p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$). Empirical evaluations on mainstream DMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion 3.5) reveal consistent failures, such as inconsistent lighting-shadow relationships and mismatched object-mirror reflections. Inspired by these findings, we design four synthetic tasks with strongly correlated features to assess DMs' rule-learning abilities. Extensive experiments show that while DMs can identify coarse-grained rules, they struggle with fine-grained ones. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that DMs trained via denoising score matching (DSM) exhibit constant errors in learning hidden rules, as the DSM objective is not compatible with rule conformity. To mitigate this, we introduce a common technique - incorporating additional classifier guidance during sampling, which achieves (limited) improvements. Our analysis reveals that the subtle signals of fine-grained rules are challenging for the classifier to capture, providing insights for future exploration.

- **Summary**: 360-degree cameras streamline data collection for radiance field 3D reconstruction by capturing comprehensive scene data. However, traditional radiance field methods do not address the specific challenges inherent to 360-degree images. We present SC-OmniGS, a novel self-calibrating omnidirectional Gaussian splatting system for fast and accurate omnidirectional radiance field reconstruction using 360-degree images. Rather than converting 360-degree images to cube maps and performing perspective image calibration, we treat 360-degree images as a whole sphere and derive a mathematical framework that enables direct omnidirectional camera pose calibration accompanied by 3D Gaussians optimization. Furthermore, we introduce a differentiable omnidirectional camera model in order to rectify the distortion of real-world data for performance enhancement. Overall, the omnidirectional camera intrinsic model, extrinsic poses, and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized by minimizing weighted spherical photometric loss. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed SC-OmniGS is able to recover a high-quality radiance field from noisy camera poses or even no pose prior in challenging scenarios characterized by wide baselines and non-object-centric configurations. The noticeable performance gain in the real-world dataset captured by consumer-grade omnidirectional cameras verifies the effectiveness of our general omnidirectional camera model in reducing the distortion of 360-degree images.

- **Summary**: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) such as fall detection has become increasingly critical due to the aging population, necessitating effective monitoring systems to prevent serious injuries and fatalities associated with falls. This study focuses on fine-tuning the Vision Transformer (ViT) model specifically for HAR using radar-based Time-Doppler signatures. Unlike traditional image datasets, these signals present unique challenges due to their non-visual nature and the high degree of similarity among various activities. Directly fine-tuning the ViT with all parameters proves suboptimal for this application. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning in the weight space to facilitate knowledge transfer from pre-trained ViT models. Additionally, to extract fine-grained features, we enhance feature representation through the integration of a serial-parallel adapter in the feature space. Our innovative joint fine-tuning method, tailored for radar-based Time-Doppler signatures, significantly improves HAR accuracy, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methodologies in this domain.

- **Summary**: Deep learning techniques are increasingly being adopted in diagnostic medical imaging. However, the limited availability of high-quality, large-scale medical datasets presents a significant challenge, often necessitating the use of transfer learning approaches. This study investigates self-supervised learning methods for pre-training capsule networks in polyp diagnostics for colon cancer. We used the PICCOLO dataset, comprising 3,433 samples, which exemplifies typical challenges in medical datasets: small size, class imbalance, and distribution shifts between data splits. Capsule networks offer inherent interpretability due to their architecture and inter-layer information routing mechanism. However, their limited native implementation in mainstream deep learning frameworks and the lack of pre-trained versions pose a significant challenge. This is particularly true if aiming to train them on small medical datasets, where leveraging pre-trained weights as initial parameters would be beneficial. We explored two auxiliary self-supervised learning tasks, colourisation and contrastive learning, for capsule network pre-training. We compared self-supervised pre-trained models against alternative initialisation strategies. Our findings suggest that contrastive learning and in-painting techniques are suitable auxiliary tasks for self-supervised learning in the medical domain. These techniques helped guide the model to capture important visual features that are beneficial for the downstream task of polyp classification, increasing its accuracy by 5.26% compared to other weight initialisation methods.

Existing safety benchmarks for VLMs primarily rely on automated evaluation methods, but these methods struggle to detect implicit harmful content or produce inaccurate evaluations. Therefore, we found that existing benchmarks have low levels of harmfulness, ambiguous data, and limited diversity in image-text pair combinations. To address these issues, we propose the ELITE benchmark, a high-quality safety evaluation benchmark for VLMs, underpinned by our enhanced evaluation method, the ELITE evaluator. The ELITE evaluator explicitly incorporates a toxicity score to accurately assess harmfulness in multimodal contexts, where VLMs often provide specific, convincing, but unharmful descriptions of images. We filter out ambiguous and low-quality image-text pairs from existing benchmarks using the ELITE evaluator and generate diverse combinations of safe and unsafe image-text pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that the ELITE evaluator achieves superior alignment with human evaluations compared to prior automated methods, and the ELITE benchmark offers enhanced benchmark quality and diversity. By introducing ELITE, we pave the way for safer, more robust VLMs, contributing essential tools for evaluating and mitigating safety risks in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: We propose a transformer architecture and training strategy for tree generation. The architecture processes data at multiple resolutions and has an hourglass shape, with middle layers processing fewer tokens than outer layers. Similar to convolutional networks, we introduce longer range skip connections to completent this multi-resolution approach. The key advantage of this architecture is the faster processing speed and lower memory consumption. We are therefore able to process more complex trees than would be possible with a vanilla transformer architecture. Furthermore, we extend this approach to perform image-to-tree and point-cloud-to-tree conditional generation and to simulate the tree growth processes, generating 4D trees. Empirical results validate our approach in terms of speed, memory consumption, and generation quality.

- **Summary**: Fever of unknown origin FUO remains a diagnostic challenge. MedMimic is introduced as a multimodal framework inspired by real-world diagnostic processes. It uses pretrained models such as DINOv2, Vision Transformer, and ResNet-18 to convert high-dimensional 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging into low-dimensional, semantically meaningful features. A learnable self-attention-based fusion network then integrates these imaging features with clinical data for classification. Using 416 FUO patient cases from Sichuan University West China Hospital from 2017 to 2023, the multimodal fusion classification network MFCN achieved macro-AUROC scores ranging from 0.8654 to 0.9291 across seven tasks, outperforming conventional machine learning and single-modality deep learning methods. Ablation studies and five-fold cross-validation further validated its effectiveness. By combining the strengths of pretrained large models and deep learning, MedMimic offers a promising solution for disease classification.

- **Summary**: While MPEG-standardized video-based point cloud compression (VPCC) achieves high compression efficiency for human perception, it struggles with a poor trade-off between bitrate savings and detection accuracy when supporting 3D object detectors. This limitation stems from VPCC's inability to prioritize regions of different importance within point clouds. To address this issue, we propose DetVPCC, a novel method integrating region-of-interest (RoI) encoding with VPCC for efficient point cloud sequence compression while preserving the 3D object detection accuracy. Specifically, we augment VPCC to support RoI-based compression by assigning spatially non-uniform quality levels. Then, we introduce a lightweight RoI detector to identify crucial regions that potentially contain objects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the detection accuracy. The code and demo video are available in supplementary materials.

- **Summary**: Visual speech recognition (VSR), which decodes spoken words from video data, offers significant benefits, particularly when audio is unavailable. However, the high dimensionality of video data leads to prohibitive computational costs that demand powerful hardware, limiting VSR deployment on resource-constrained devices. This work addresses this limitation by developing lightweight VSR architectures. Leveraging efficient operation design paradigms, we create compact yet powerful models with reduced resource requirements and minimal accuracy loss. We train and evaluate our models on a large-scale public dataset for recognition of words from video sequences, demonstrating their effectiveness for practical applications. We also conduct an extensive array of ablative experiments to thoroughly analyze the size and complexity of each model. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: The task of estimating camera poses can be enhanced through novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and Gaussian Splatting to increase the diversity and extension of training data. However, these techniques often produce rendered images with issues like blurring and ghosting, which compromise their reliability. These issues become particularly pronounced for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which estimate 3D coordinates at the pixel level. To mitigate the problems associated with unreliable rendered images, we introduce a novel filtering approach, which selectively extracts well-rendered pixels while discarding the inferior ones. This filter simultaneously measures the SCR model's real-time reprojection loss and gradient during training. Building on this filtering technique, we also develop a new strategy to improve scene coordinate regression using sparse inputs, drawing on successful applications of sparse input techniques in novel view synthesis. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on indoor and outdoor datasets.

- **Summary**: Human motion video generation has advanced significantly, while existing methods still struggle with accurately rendering detailed body parts like hands and faces, especially in long sequences and intricate motions. Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse scenarios.

- **Summary**: This work introduces a novel deep-learning approach for estimating age from a single facial image by refining an initial age estimate. The refinement leverages a reference face database of individuals with similar ages and appearances. We employ a network that estimates age differences between an input image and reference images with known ages, thus refining the initial estimate. Our method explicitly models age-dependent facial variations using differential regression, yielding improved accuracy compared to conventional absolute age estimation. Additionally, we introduce an age augmentation scheme that iteratively refines initial age estimates by modeling their error distribution during training. This iterative approach further enhances the initial estimates. Our approach surpasses existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the MORPH II and CACD datasets. Furthermore, we examine the biases inherent in contemporary state-of-the-art age estimation techniques.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of AI-generated media poses significant challenges to information authenticity and social trust, making reliable detection methods highly demanded. Methods for detecting AI-generated media have evolved rapidly, paralleling the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current detection approaches can be categorized into two main groups: Non-MLLM-based and MLLM-based methods. The former employs high-precision, domain-specific detectors powered by deep learning techniques, while the latter utilizes general-purpose detectors based on MLLMs that integrate authenticity verification, explainability, and localization capabilities. Despite significant progress in this field, there remains a gap in literature regarding a comprehensive survey that examines the transition from domain-specific to general-purpose detection methods. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic review of both approaches, analyzing them from single-modal and multi-modal perspectives. We present a detailed comparative analysis of these categories, examining their methodological similarities and differences. Through this analysis, we explore potential hybrid approaches and identify key challenges in forgery detection, providing direction for future research. Additionally, as MLLMs become increasingly prevalent in detection tasks, ethical and security considerations have emerged as critical global concerns. We examine the regulatory landscape surrounding Generative AI (GenAI) across various jurisdictions, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this field.



### IPSeg: Image Posterior Mitigates Semantic Drift in Class-Incremental Segmentation

- **Summary**: Class incremental learning aims to enable models to learn from sequential, non-stationary data streams across different tasks without catastrophic forgetting. In class incremental semantic segmentation (CISS), the semantic content of image pixels evolves over incremental phases, known as semantic drift. In this work, we identify two critical challenges in CISS that contribute to semantic drift and degrade performance. First, we highlight the issue of separate optimization, where different parts of the model are optimized in distinct incremental stages, leading to misaligned probability scales. Second, we identify noisy semantics arising from inappropriate pseudo-labeling, which results in sub-optimal results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and effective approach, Image Posterior and Semantics Decoupling for Segmentation (IPSeg). IPSeg introduces two key mechanisms: (1) leveraging image posterior probabilities to align optimization across stages and mitigate the effects of separate optimization, and (2) employing semantics decoupling to handle noisy semantics and tailor learning strategies for different semantics. Extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that IPSeg achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging long-term incremental scenarios.

- **Summary**: A key step in Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) workflows is the evaluation of the patient's anatomy at treatment time to ensure the accuracy of the delivery. To this end, Cone Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT) is widely used being cost-effective and easy to integrate into the treatment process. Nonetheless, CBCT images have lower resolution and more artifacts than CT scans, making them less reliable for precise treatment validation. Moreover, in complex treatments such as Total Marrow and Lymph Node Irradiation (TMLI), where full-body visualization of the patient is critical for accurate dose delivery, the CBCT images are often discontinuous, leaving gaps that could contain relevant anatomical information. To address these limitations, we propose ARTInp (Adaptive Radiation Therapy Inpainting), a novel deep-learning framework combining image inpainting and CBCT-to-CT translation. ARTInp employs a dual-network approach: a completion network that fills anatomical gaps in CBCT volumes and a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate high-quality synthetic CT (sCT) images. We trained ARTInp on a dataset of paired CBCT and CT images from the SynthRad 2023 challenge, and the performance achieved on a test set of 18 patients demonstrates its potential for enhancing CBCT-based workflows in radiotherapy.

- **Summary**: Pansharpening aims to combine a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image to produce a high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image. Although pansharpening in the frequency domain offers clear advantages, most existing methods either continue to operate solely in the spatial domain or fail to fully exploit the benefits of the frequency domain. To address this issue, we innovatively propose Multi-Frequency Fusion Attention (MFFA), which leverages wavelet transforms to cleanly separate frequencies and enable lossless reconstruction across different frequency domains. Then, we generate Frequency-Query, Spatial-Key, and Fusion-Value based on the physical meanings represented by different features, which enables a more effective capture of specific information in the frequency domain. Additionally, we focus on the preservation of frequency features across different operations. On a broader level, our network employs a wavelet pyramid to progressively fuse information across multiple scales. Compared to previous frequency domain approaches, our network better prevents confusion and loss of different frequency features during the fusion process. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches and shows significant generalization capabilities for real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Explaining the hidden representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a perspective to understand LLMs' underlying inference logic and improve their reliability in application scenarios. However, previous methods introduce external ''black-box'' modules to explain ''black-box'' LLMs, increasing the potential uncertainty and failing to provide faithful explanations. In this paper, we propose a self-explaining method SEER, enhancing LLMs' explainability by aggregating the same concept and disentangling the different concepts in the representation space. In this way, SEER provides faithful explanations carried by representations synchronously with the LLMs' output. Additionally, we showcase the applications of SEER on trustworthiness-related tasks (e.g., the safety risks classification and detoxification tasks), where self-explained LLMs achieve consistent improvement in explainability and performance. More crucially, we theoretically analyze the improvement of SEER on LLMs' generalization ability through optimal transport theory.

- **Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted technique in text-to-image models, enabling precise rendering of multiple distinct elements, such as characters and styles, in multi-concept image generation. However, current approaches face significant challenges when composing these LoRAs for multi-concept image generation, resulting in diminished generated image quality. In this paper, we initially investigate the role of LoRAs in the denoising process through the lens of the Fourier frequency domain. Based on the hypothesis that applying multiple LoRAs could lead to "semantic conflicts", we find that certain LoRAs amplify high-frequency features such as edges and textures, whereas others mainly focus on low-frequency elements, including the overall structure and smooth color gradients. Building on these insights, we devise a frequency domain based sequencing strategy to determine the optimal order in which LoRAs should be integrated during inference. This strategy offers a methodical and generalizable solution compared to the naive integration commonly found in existing LoRA fusion techniques. To fully leverage our proposed LoRA order sequence determination method in multi-LoRA composition tasks, we introduce a novel, training-free framework, Cached Multi-LoRA (CMLoRA), designed to efficiently integrate multiple LoRAs while maintaining cohesive image generation. With its flexible backbone for multi-LoRA fusion and a non-uniform caching strategy tailored to individual LoRAs, CMLoRA has the potential to reduce semantic conflicts in LoRA composition and improve computational efficiency. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art training-free LoRA fusion methods by a significant margin -- it achieves an average improvement of $2.19\%$ in CLIPScore, and $11.25\%$ in MLLM win rate compared to LoraHub, LoRA Composite, and LoRA Switch.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, but it achieved its tremendous success using deep network architectures which are mostly hand-crafted and therefore likely suboptimal. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to bridge this gap by following a well-defined optimization paradigm which systematically looks for the best architecture, given objective criterion such as maximal classification accuracy. The main limitation of NAS is however its astronomical computational cost, as it typically requires training each candidate network architecture from scratch.   In this paper, we aim to alleviate this limitation by proposing a novel training-free proxy for image classification accuracy based on Fisher Information. The proposed proxy has a strong theoretical background in statistics and it allows estimating expected image classification accuracy of a given deep network without training the network, thus significantly reducing computational cost of standard NAS algorithms.   Our training-free proxy achieves state-of-the-art results on three public datasets and in two search spaces, both when evaluated using previously proposed metrics, as well as using a new metric that we propose which we demonstrate is more informative for practical NAS applications.

- **Summary**: Obtaining semantic 3D occupancy from raw sensor data without manual annotations remains an essential yet challenging task. While prior works have approached this as a perception prediction problem, we formulate it as scene-aware 3D occupancy reconstruction with geometry and semantics. In this work, we propose OccGS, a novel 3D Occupancy reconstruction framework utilizing Semantic and Geometric-Aware Gaussian Splatting in a zero-shot manner. Leveraging semantics extracted from vision-language models and geometry guided by LiDAR points, OccGS constructs Semantic and Geometric-Aware Gaussians from raw multisensor data. We also develop a cumulative Gaussian-to-3D voxel splatting method for reconstructing occupancy from the Gaussians. OccGS performs favorably against self-supervised methods in occupancy prediction, achieving comparable performance to fully supervised approaches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot semantic 3D occupancy estimation.

- **Summary**: Learned Image Compression (LIC) has explored various architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, in modeling image content distributions in order to achieve compression effectiveness. However, achieving high rate-distortion performance while maintaining low computational complexity (\ie, parameters, FLOPs, and latency) remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Convolution and State Space Models (SSMs) based image compression framework, termed \textit{CMamba}, to achieve superior rate-distortion performance with low computational complexity. Specifically, CMamba introduces two key components: a Content-Adaptive SSM (CA-SSM) module and a Context-Aware Entropy (CAE) module. First, we observed that SSMs excel in modeling overall content but tend to lose high-frequency details. In contrast, CNNs are proficient at capturing local details. Motivated by this, we propose the CA-SSM module that can dynamically fuse global content extracted by SSM blocks and local details captured by CNN blocks in both encoding and decoding stages. As a result, important image content is well preserved during compression. Second, our proposed CAE module is designed to reduce spatial and channel redundancies in latent representations after encoding. Specifically, our CAE leverages SSMs to parameterize the spatial content in latent representations. Benefiting from SSMs, CAE significantly improves spatial compression efficiency while reducing spatial content redundancies. Moreover, along the channel dimension, CAE reduces inter-channel redundancies of latent representations via an autoregressive manner, which can fully exploit prior knowledge from previous channels without sacrificing efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that CMamba achieves superior rate-distortion performance.

- **Summary**: Multi-scale maps are essential representations of surveying and cartographic results, serving as fundamental components of geographic services. Current image generation networks can quickly produce map tiles from remote-sensing images. However, generative models designed for natural images often focus on texture features, neglecting the unique characteristics of remote-sensing features and the scale attributes of tile maps. This limitation in generative models impairs the accurate representation of geographic information, and the quality of tile map generation still needs improvement. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, highlighting their potential to address this challenge. This paper presents C2GM, a novel framework for generating multi-scale tile maps through conditional guided diffusion and multi-scale cascade generation. Specifically, we implement a conditional feature fusion encoder to extract object priors from remote sensing images and cascade reference double branch input, ensuring an accurate representation of complex features. Low-level generated tiles act as constraints for high-level map generation, enhancing visual continuity. Moreover, we incorporate map scale modality information using CLIP to simulate the relationship between map scale and cartographic generalization in tile maps. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that C2GM consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics, facilitating the rapid and effective generation of multi-scale large-format maps for emergency response and remote mapping applications.

- **Summary**: Dataset distillation compresses a large dataset into a small synthetic subset that retains essential information. Existing methods assume that all samples are perfectly labeled, limiting their real-world applications where incorrect labels are ubiquitous. These mislabeled samples introduce untrustworthy information into the dataset, which misleads model optimization in dataset distillation. To tackle this issue, we propose a Trust-Aware Diversion (TAD) dataset distillation method. Our proposed TAD introduces an iterative dual-loop optimization framework for data-effective distillation. Specifically, the outer loop divides data into trusted and untrusted spaces, redirecting distillation toward trusted samples to guarantee trust in the distillation process. This step minimizes the impact of mislabeled samples on dataset distillation. The inner loop maximizes the distillation objective by recalibrating untrusted samples, thus transforming them into valuable ones for distillation. This dual-loop iteratively refines and compensates for each other, gradually expanding the trusted space and shrinking the untrusted space. Experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of existing dataset distillation methods on three widely used benchmarks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny ImageNet) in three challenging mislabeled settings (symmetric, asymmetric, and real-world).

- **Summary**: Brain decoding aims to reconstruct visual perception of human subject from fMRI signals, which is crucial for understanding brain's perception mechanisms. Existing methods are confined to the single-subject paradigm due to substantial brain variability, which leads to weak generalization across individuals and incurs high training costs, exacerbated by limited availability of fMRI data. To address these challenges, we propose MindAligner, an explicit functional alignment framework for cross-subject brain decoding from limited fMRI data. The proposed MindAligner enjoys several merits. First, we learn a Brain Transfer Matrix (BTM) that projects the brain signals of an arbitrary new subject to one of the known subjects, enabling seamless use of pre-trained decoding models. Second, to facilitate reliable BTM learning, a Brain Functional Alignment module is proposed to perform soft cross-subject brain alignment under different visual stimuli with a multi-level brain alignment loss, uncovering fine-grained functional correspondences with high interpretability. Experiments indicate that MindAligner not only outperforms existing methods in visual decoding under data-limited conditions, but also provides valuable neuroscience insights in cross-subject functional analysis. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Robotic simulators play a crucial role in the development and testing of autonomous systems, particularly in the realm of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, existing simulators often lack high-level autonomy, hindering their immediate applicability to complex tasks such as autonomous navigation in unknown environments. This limitation stems from the challenge of integrating realistic physics, photorealistic rendering, and diverse sensor modalities into a single simulation environment. At the same time, the existing photorealistic UAV simulators use mostly hand-crafted environments with limited environment sizes, which prevents the testing of long-range missions. This restricts the usage of existing simulators to only low-level tasks such as control and collision avoidance. To this end, we propose the novel FlightForge UAV open-source simulator. FlightForge offers advanced rendering capabilities, diverse control modalities, and, foremost, procedural generation of environments. Moreover, the simulator is already integrated with a fully autonomous UAV system capable of long-range flights in cluttered unknown environments. The key innovation lies in novel procedural environment generation and seamless integration of high-level autonomy into the simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate superior sensor rendering capability compared to existing simulators, and also the ability of autonomous navigation in almost infinite environments.

- **Summary**: Understanding the 3D geometry and semantics of driving scenes is critical for developing of safe autonomous vehicles. While 3D occupancy models are typically trained using voxel-based supervision with standard losses (e.g., cross-entropy, Lovasz, dice), these approaches treat voxel predictions independently, neglecting their spatial relationships. In this paper, we propose GaussRender, a plug-and-play 3D-to-2D reprojection loss that enhances voxel-based supervision. Our method projects 3D voxel representations into arbitrary 2D perspectives and leverages Gaussian splatting as an efficient, differentiable rendering proxy of voxels, introducing spatial dependencies across projected elements. This approach improves semantic and geometric consistency, handles occlusions more efficiently, and requires no architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, SSCBench-KITTI360) demonstrate consistent performance gains across various 3D occupancy models (TPVFormer, SurroundOcc, Symphonies), highlighting the robustness and versatility of our framework.

- **Summary**: Display photometric stereo uses a display as a programmable light source to illuminate a scene with diverse illumination conditions. Recently, differentiable display photometric stereo (DDPS) demonstrated improved normal reconstruction accuracy by using learned display patterns. However, DDPS faced limitations in practicality, requiring a fixed desktop imaging setup using a polarization camera and a desktop-scale monitor. In this paper, we propose a more practical physics-based photometric stereo, differentiable mobile display photometric stereo (DMDPS), that leverages a mobile phone consisting of a display and a camera. We overcome the limitations of using a mobile device by developing a mobile app and method that simultaneously displays patterns and captures high-quality HDR images. Using this technique, we capture real-world 3D-printed objects and learn display patterns via a differentiable learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DMDPS on both a 3D printed dataset and a first dataset of fallen leaves. The leaf dataset contains reconstructed surface normals and albedos of fallen leaves that may enable future research beyond computer graphics and vision. We believe that DMDPS takes a step forward for practical physics-based photometric stereo.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art visual generation models, such as Diffusion Models (DMs) and Vision Auto-Regressive Models (VARs), produce highly realistic images. While prior work has successfully mitigated Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content in the visual domain, we identify a novel threat: the generation of NSFW text embedded within images. This includes offensive language, such as insults, racial slurs, and sexually explicit terms, posing significant risks to users. We show that all state-of-the-art DMs (e.g., SD3, Flux, DeepFloyd IF) and VARs (e.g., Infinity) are vulnerable to this issue. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that existing mitigation techniques, effective for visual content, fail to prevent harmful text generation while substantially degrading benign text generation. As an initial step toward addressing this threat, we explore safety fine-tuning of the text encoder underlying major DM architectures using a customized dataset. Thereby, we suppress NSFW generation while preserving overall image and text generation quality. Finally, to advance research in this area, we introduce ToxicBench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating NSFW text generation in images. ToxicBench provides a curated dataset of harmful prompts, new metrics, and an evaluation pipeline assessing both NSFW-ness and generation quality. Our benchmark aims to guide future efforts in mitigating NSFW text generation in text-to-image models.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) align visual and textual representations, enabling high-performance zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval in 2D medical imaging. However, extending VLMs to 3D medical imaging remains computationally challenging. Existing 3D VLMs rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which are computationally expensive due to self-attention's quadratic complexity, or 3D convolutions, which demand excessive parameters and FLOPs as kernel size increases. We introduce DCFormer, an efficient 3D medical image encoder that factorizes 3D convolutions into three parallel 1D convolutions along depth, height, and width. This design preserves spatial information while significantly reducing computational cost. Integrated into a CLIP-based vision-language framework, DCFormer is evaluated on CT-RATE, a dataset of 50,188 paired 3D chest CT volumes and radiology reports, for zero-shot multi-abnormality detection across 18 pathologies. Compared to ViT, ConvNeXt, PoolFormer, and TransUNet, DCFormer achieves superior efficiency and accuracy, with DCFormer-Tiny reaching 62.0% accuracy and a 46.3% F1-score while using significantly fewer parameters. These results highlight DCFormer's potential for scalable, clinically deployable 3D medical VLMs. Our codes will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Understanding time from visual representations is a fundamental cognitive skill, yet it remains a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we investigate the capabilities of MLLMs in interpreting time and date through analogue clocks and yearly calendars. To facilitate this, we curated a structured dataset comprising two subsets: 1) $\textit{ClockQA}$, which comprises various types of clock styles$-$standard, black-dial, no-second-hand, Roman numeral, and arrow-hand clocks$-$paired with time related questions; and 2) $\textit{CalendarQA}$, which consists of yearly calendar images with questions ranging from commonly known dates (e.g., Christmas, New Year's Day) to computationally derived ones (e.g., the 100th or 153rd day of the year). We aim to analyse how MLLMs can perform visual recognition, numerical reasoning, and temporal inference when presented with time-related visual data. Our evaluations show that despite recent advancements, reliably understanding time remains a significant challenge for MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Paired inspiratory-expiratory CT scans enable the quantification of gas trapping due to small airway disease and emphysema by analyzing lung tissue motion in COPD patients. Deformable image registration of these scans assesses regional lung volumetric changes. However, variations in reconstruction kernels between paired scans introduce errors in quantitative analysis. This work proposes a two-stage pipeline to harmonize reconstruction kernels and perform deformable image registration using data acquired from the COPDGene study. We use a cycle generative adversarial network (GAN) to harmonize inspiratory scans reconstructed with a hard kernel (BONE) to match expiratory scans reconstructed with a soft kernel (STANDARD). We then deformably register the expiratory scans to inspiratory scans. We validate harmonization by measuring emphysema using a publicly available segmentation algorithm before and after harmonization. Results show harmonization significantly reduces emphysema measurement inconsistencies, decreasing median emphysema scores from 10.479% to 3.039%, with a reference median score of 1.305% from the STANDARD kernel as the target. Registration accuracy is evaluated via Dice overlap between emphysema regions on inspiratory, expiratory, and deformed images. The Dice coefficient between inspiratory emphysema masks and deformably registered emphysema masks increases significantly across registration stages (p<0.001). Additionally, we demonstrate that deformable registration is robust to kernel variations.

- **Summary**: Most image restoration problems are ill-conditioned or ill-posed and hence involve significant uncertainty. Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for reliably interpreting experimental results, particularly when reconstructed images inform critical decisions and science. However, most existing image restoration methods either fail to quantify uncertainty or provide estimates that are highly inaccurate. Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a flexible framework to equip any estimator with uncertainty quantification capabilities that, by construction, have nearly exact marginal coverage. To achieve this, conformal prediction relies on abundant ground truth data for calibration. However, in image restoration problems, reliable ground truth data is often expensive or not possible to acquire. Also, reliance on ground truth data can introduce large biases in situations of distribution shift between calibration and deployment. This paper seeks to develop a more robust approach to conformal prediction for image restoration problems by proposing a self-supervised conformal prediction method that leverages Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to self-calibrate itself directly from the observed noisy measurements, bypassing the need for ground truth. The method is suitable for any linear imaging inverse problem that is ill-conditioned, and it is especially powerful when used with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques that can also be trained directly from measurement data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring, where it delivers results that are remarkably accurate and comparable to those obtained by supervised conformal prediction with ground truth data.

- **Summary**: Accurate estimates of salmon escapement - the number of fish migrating upstream to spawn - are key data for conservation and fishery management. Existing methods for salmon counting using high-resolution imaging sonar hardware are non-invasive and compatible with computer vision processing. Prior work in this area has utilized object detection and tracking based methods for automated salmon counting. However, these techniques remain inaccessible to many sonar deployment sites due to limited compute and connectivity in the field. We propose an alternative lightweight computer vision method for fish counting based on analyzing echograms - temporal representations that compress several hundred frames of imaging sonar video into a single image. We predict upstream and downstream counts within 200-frame time windows directly from echograms using a ResNet-18 model, and propose a set of domain-specific image augmentations and a weakly-supervised training protocol to further improve results. We achieve a count error of 23% on representative data from the Kenai River in Alaska, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.

- **Summary**: Previous work on long-form audio generation using global-view diffusion or iterative generation demands significant training or inference costs. While recent advancements in multi-view joint diffusion for panoramic generation provide an efficient option, they struggle with spectrum generation with severe overlap distortions and high cross-view consistency costs. We initially explore this phenomenon through the connectivity inheritance of latent maps and uncover that averaging operations excessively smooth the high-frequency components of the latent map. To address these issues, we propose Swap Forward (SaFa), a frame-level latent swap framework that synchronizes multiple diffusions to produce a globally coherent long audio with more spectrum details in a forward-only manner. At its core, the bidirectional Self-Loop Latent Swap is applied between adjacent views, leveraging stepwise diffusion trajectory to adaptively enhance high-frequency components without disrupting low-frequency components. Furthermore, to ensure cross-view consistency, the unidirectional Reference-Guided Latent Swap is applied between the reference and the non-overlap regions of each subview during the early stages, providing centralized trajectory guidance. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based long audio generation models. Moreover, we find that it also adapts well to panoramic generation, achieving comparable state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency and model generalizability.

- **Summary**: Chest X-ray (CXR) is the most frequently ordered imaging test, supporting diverse clinical tasks from thoracic disease detection to postoperative monitoring. However, task-specific classification models are limited in scope, require costly labeled data, and lack generalizability to out-of-distribution datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce CheXFound, a self-supervised vision foundation model that learns robust CXR representations and generalizes effectively across a wide range of downstream tasks. We pretrain CheXFound on a curated CXR-1M dataset, comprising over one million unique CXRs from publicly available sources. We propose a Global and Local Representations Integration (GLoRI) module for downstream adaptations, by incorporating disease-specific local features with global image features for enhanced performance in multilabel classification. Our experimental results show that CheXFound outperforms state-of-the-art models in classifying 40 disease findings across different prevalence levels on the CXR-LT 24 dataset and exhibits superior label efficiency on downstream tasks with limited training data. Additionally, CheXFound achieved significant improvements on new tasks with out-of-distribution datasets, including opportunistic cardiovascular disease risk estimation and mortality prediction. These results highlight CheXFound's strong generalization capabilities, enabling diverse adaptations with improved label efficiency. The project source code is publicly available at https://github.com/RPIDIAL/CheXFound.

- **Summary**: This paper presents LP-DETR (Layer-wise Progressive DETR), a novel approach that enhances DETR-based object detection through multi-scale relation modeling. Our method introduces learnable spatial relationships between object queries through a relation-aware self-attention mechanism, which adaptively learns to balance different scales of relations (local, medium and global) across decoder layers. This progressive design enables the model to effectively capture evolving spatial dependencies throughout the detection pipeline. Extensive experiments on COCO 2017 dataset demonstrate that our method improves both convergence speed and detection accuracy compared to standard self-attention module. The proposed method achieves competitive results, reaching 52.3\% AP with 12 epochs and 52.5\% AP with 24 epochs using ResNet-50 backbone, and further improving to 58.0\% AP with Swin-L backbone. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an interesting pattern: the model naturally learns to prioritize local spatial relations in early decoder layers while gradually shifting attention to broader contexts in deeper layers, providing valuable insights for future research in object detection.

- **Summary**: While diffusion models are powerful in generating high-quality, diverse synthetic data for object-centric tasks, existing methods struggle with scene-aware tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Human-Object Interaction (HOI) Reasoning, where it is critical to preserve scene attributes in generated images consistent with a multimodal context, i.e. a reference image with accompanying text guidance query. To address this, we introduce Hummingbird, the first diffusion-based image generator which, given a multimodal context, generates highly diverse images w.r.t. the reference image while ensuring high fidelity by accurately preserving scene attributes, such as object interactions and spatial relationships from the text guidance. Hummingbird employs a novel Multimodal Context Evaluator that simultaneously optimizes our formulated Global Semantic and Fine-grained Consistency Rewards to ensure generated images preserve the scene attributes of reference images in relation to the text guidance while maintaining diversity. As the first model to address the task of maintaining both diversity and fidelity given a multimodal context, we introduce a new benchmark formulation incorporating MME Perception and Bongard HOI datasets. Benchmark experiments show Hummingbird outperforms all existing methods by achieving superior fidelity while maintaining diversity, validating Hummingbird's potential as a robust multimodal context-aligned image generator in complex visual tasks.

- **Summary**: We introduce the first generative model capable of simultaneous multi-object compositing, guided by both text and layout. Our model allows for the addition of multiple objects within a scene, capturing a range of interactions from simple positional relations (e.g., next to, in front of) to complex actions requiring reposing (e.g., hugging, playing guitar). When an interaction implies additional props, like `taking a selfie', our model autonomously generates these supporting objects. By jointly training for compositing and subject-driven generation, also known as customization, we achieve a more balanced integration of textual and visual inputs for text-driven object compositing. As a result, we obtain a versatile model with state-of-the-art performance in both tasks. We further present a data generation pipeline leveraging visual and language models to effortlessly synthesize multimodal, aligned training data.

- **Summary**: Incorporating geometric invariance into neural networks enhances parameter efficiency but typically increases computational costs. This paper introduces new equivariant neural networks that preserve symmetry while maintaining a comparable number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) per parameter to standard non-equivariant networks. We focus on horizontal mirroring (flopping) invariance, common in many computer vision tasks. The main idea is to parametrize the feature spaces in terms of mirror-symmetric and mirror-antisymmetric features, i.e., irreps of the flopping group. This decomposes the linear layers to be block-diagonal, requiring half the number of FLOPs. Our approach reduces both FLOPs and wall-clock time, providing a practical solution for efficient, scalable symmetry-aware architectures.

- **Summary**: While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and its variants are widely adopted for their long-context capabilities, the extension of the 1D RoPE to video, with its complex spatio-temporal structure, remains an open challenge. This work first introduces a comprehensive analysis that identifies four key characteristics essential for the effective adaptation of RoPE to video, which have not been fully considered in prior work. As part of our analysis, we introduce a challenging V-NIAH-D (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack with Distractors) task, which adds periodic distractors into V-NIAH. The V-NIAH-D task demonstrates that previous RoPE variants, lacking appropriate temporal dimension allocation, are easily misled by distractors. Based on our analysis, we introduce \textbf{VideoRoPE}, with a \textit{3D structure} designed to preserve spatio-temporal relationships. VideoRoPE features \textit{low-frequency temporal allocation} to mitigate periodic oscillations, a \textit{diagonal layout} to maintain spatial symmetry, and \textit{adjustable temporal spacing} to decouple temporal and spatial indexing. VideoRoPE consistently surpasses previous RoPE variants, across diverse downstream tasks such as long video retrieval, video understanding, and video hallucination.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present Fillerbuster, a method that completes unknown regions of a 3D scene by utilizing a novel large-scale multi-view latent diffusion transformer. Casual captures are often sparse and miss surrounding content behind objects or above the scene. Existing methods are not suitable for handling this challenge as they focus on making the known pixels look good with sparse-view priors, or on creating the missing sides of objects from just one or two photos. In reality, we often have hundreds of input frames and want to complete areas that are missing and unobserved from the input frames. Additionally, the images often do not have known camera parameters. Our solution is to train a generative model that can consume a large context of input frames while generating unknown target views and recovering image poses when desired. We show results where we complete partial captures on two existing datasets. We also present an uncalibrated scene completion task where our unified model predicts both poses and creates new content. Our model is the first to predict many images and poses together for scene completion.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional scene inpainting is crucial for applications from virtual reality to architectural visualization, yet existing methods struggle with view consistency and geometric accuracy in 360{\deg} unbounded scenes. We present AuraFusion360, a novel reference-based method that enables high-quality object removal and hole filling in 3D scenes represented by Gaussian Splatting. Our approach introduces (1) depth-aware unseen mask generation for accurate occlusion identification, (2) Adaptive Guided Depth Diffusion, a zero-shot method for accurate initial point placement without requiring additional training, and (3) SDEdit-based detail enhancement for multi-view coherence. We also introduce 360-USID, the first comprehensive dataset for 360{\deg} unbounded scene inpainting with ground truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AuraFusion360 significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior perceptual quality while maintaining geometric accuracy across dramatic viewpoint changes.

- **Summary**: Establishing the long-context capability of large vision-language models is crucial for video understanding, high-resolution image understanding, multi-modal agents and reasoning. We introduce Long-VITA, a simple yet effective large multi-modal model for long-context visual-language understanding tasks. It is adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, and text over 4K frames or 1M tokens while delivering advanced performances on short-context multi-modal tasks. We propose an effective multi-modal training schema that starts with large language models and proceeds through vision-language alignment, general knowledge learning, and two sequential stages of long-sequence fine-tuning. We further implement context-parallelism distributed inference and logits-masked language modeling head to scale Long-VITA to infinitely long inputs of images and texts during model inference. Regarding training data, Long-VITA is built on a mix of $17$M samples from public datasets only and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on various multi-modal benchmarks, compared against recent cutting-edge models with internal data. Long-VITA is fully reproducible and supports both NPU and GPU platforms for training and testing. We hope Long-VITA can serve as a competitive baseline and offer valuable insights for the open-source community in advancing long-context multi-modal understanding.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We introduce Quantized Language-Image Pretraining (QLIP), a visual tokenization method that combines state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with state-of-the-art zero-shot image understanding. QLIP trains a binary-spherical-quantization-based autoencoder with reconstruction and language-image alignment objectives. We are the first to show that the two objectives do not need to be at odds. We balance the two loss terms dynamically during training and show that a two-stage training pipeline effectively mixes the large-batch requirements of image-language pre-training with the memory bottleneck imposed by the reconstruction objective. We validate the effectiveness of QLIP for multimodal understanding and text-conditioned image generation with a single model. Specifically, QLIP serves as a drop-in replacement for the visual encoder for LLaVA and the image tokenizer for LlamaGen with comparable or even better performance. Finally, we demonstrate that QLIP enables a unified mixed-modality auto-regressive model for understanding and generation.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: DiT diffusion models have achieved great success in text-to-video generation, leveraging their scalability in model capacity and data scale. High content and motion fidelity aligned with text prompts, however, often require large model parameters and a substantial number of function evaluations (NFEs). Realistic and visually appealing details are typically reflected in high resolution outputs, further amplifying computational demands especially for single stage DiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two stage framework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs across stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage, prompt fidelity is prioritized through a low resolution generation process utilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational efficiency. The second stage establishes flow matching between low and high resolutions, effectively generating fine details with minimal NFEs. Quantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves state-of-the-art high resolution video generation with superior computational efficiency. Additionally, the two-stage design enables users to preview the initial output before committing to full resolution generation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs and wait times as well as enhancing commercial viability .

- **Summary**: Reliable failure detection holds paramount importance in safety-critical applications. Yet, neural networks are known to produce overconfident predictions for misclassified samples. As a result, it remains a problematic matter as existing confidence score functions rely on category-level signals, the logits, to detect failures. This research introduces an innovative strategy, leveraging human-level concepts for a dual purpose: to reliably detect when a model fails and to transparently interpret why. By integrating a nuanced array of signals for each category, our method enables a finer-grained assessment of the model's confidence. We present a simple yet highly effective approach based on the ordinal ranking of concept activation to the input image. Without bells and whistles, our method significantly reduce the false positive rate across diverse real-world image classification benchmarks, specifically by 3.7% on ImageNet and 9% on EuroSAT.

The proposed recognition model incorporates state-of-the-art CNN-based feature extraction, and Transformer-based sequence modeling to accommodate variations in handwriting styles, stroke thicknesses, alignments, and noise conditions. The evaluation of the model suggests its strong performances on both printed and handwritten texts, yielding 0.59% CER and & 1.72% WER on printed text, and 7.91% CER and 31.41% WER on handwritten text. The overall proposed solution has proven to be relied on in real-life OCR tasks. Equipped with both detection and recognition models as well as other Feature Extraction and Matching helping algorithms. With the general purpose implementation, making the solution valid for any given document or receipt that is Arabic handwritten or printed. Thus, it is practical and useful for any given context.

- **Summary**: Dense contrastive representation learning (DCRL) has greatly improved the learning efficiency for image-dense prediction tasks, showing its great potential to reduce the large costs of medical image collection and dense annotation. However, the properties of medical images make unreliable correspondence discovery, bringing an open problem of large-scale false positive and negative (FP&N) pairs in DCRL. In this paper, we propose GEoMetric vIsual deNse sImilarity (GEMINI) learning which embeds the homeomorphism prior to DCRL and enables a reliable correspondence discovery for effective dense contrast. We propose a deformable homeomorphism learning (DHL) which models the homeomorphism of medical images and learns to estimate a deformable mapping to predict the pixels' correspondence under topological preservation. It effectively reduces the searching space of pairing and drives an implicit and soft learning of negative pairs via a gradient. We also propose a geometric semantic similarity (GSS) which extracts semantic information in features to measure the alignment degree for the correspondence learning. It will promote the learning efficiency and performance of deformation, constructing positive pairs reliably. We implement two practical variants on two typical representation learning tasks in our experiments. Our promising results on seven datasets which outperform the existing methods show our great superiority. We will release our code on a companion link: https://github.com/YutingHe-list/GEMINI.

- **Summary**: Drones or unmanned aerial vehicles are traditionally used for military missions, warfare, and espionage. However, the usage of drones has significantly increased due to multiple industrial applications involving security and inspection, transportation, research purposes, and recreational drone flying. Such an increased volume of drone activity in public spaces requires regulatory actions for purposes of privacy protection and safety. Hence, detection of illegal drone activities such as boundary encroachment becomes a necessity. Such detection tasks are usually automated and performed by deep learning models which are trained on annotated image datasets. This paper builds on a previous work and extends an already published open source dataset. A description and analysis of the entire dataset is provided. The dataset is used to train the YOLOv7 deep learning model and some of its minor variants and the results are provided. Since the detection models are based on a single image input, a simple cross-correlation based tracker is used to reduce detection drops and improve tracking performance in videos. Finally, the entire drone detection system is summarized.

- **Summary**: Accurate fine-grained segmentation of the renal vasculature is critical for nephrological analysis, yet it faces challenges due to diverse and insufficiently annotated images. Existing methods struggle to accurately segment intricate regions of the renal vasculature, such as the inner and outer walls, arteries and lesions. In this paper, we introduce FH-Seg, a Full-scale Hierarchical Learning Framework designed for comprehensive segmentation of the renal vasculature. Specifically, FH-Seg employs full-scale skip connections that merge detailed anatomical information with contextual semantics across scales, effectively bridging the gap between structural and pathological contexts. Additionally, we implement a learnable hierarchical soft attention gates to adaptively reduce interference from non-core information, enhancing the focus on critical vascular features. To advance research on renal pathology segmentation, we also developed a Large Renal Vasculature (LRV) dataset, which contains 16,212 fine-grained annotated images of 5,600 renal arteries. Extensive experiments on the LRV dataset demonstrate FH-Seg's superior accuracies (71.23% Dice, 73.06% F1), outperforming Omni-Seg by 2.67 and 2.13 percentage points respectively.

- **Summary**: Multi-class segmentation of the aorta in computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans is essential for diagnosing and planning complex endovascular treatments for patients with aortic dissections. However, existing methods reduce aortic segmentation to a binary problem, limiting their ability to measure diameters across different branches and zones. Furthermore, no open-source dataset is currently available to support the development of multi-class aortic segmentation methods. To address this gap, we organized the AortaSeg24 MICCAI Challenge, introducing the first dataset of 100 CTA volumes annotated for 23 clinically relevant aortic branches and zones. This dataset was designed to facilitate both model development and validation. The challenge attracted 121 teams worldwide, with participants leveraging state-of-the-art frameworks such as nnU-Net and exploring novel techniques, including cascaded models, data augmentation strategies, and custom loss functions. We evaluated the submitted algorithms using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Normalized Surface Distance (NSD), highlighting the approaches adopted by the top five performing teams. This paper presents the challenge design, dataset details, evaluation metrics, and an in-depth analysis of the top-performing algorithms. The annotated dataset, evaluation code, and implementations of the leading methods are publicly available to support further research.

- **Summary**: This work addresses the problem of active 3D mapping, where an agent must find an efficient trajectory to exhaustively reconstruct a new scene. Previous approaches mainly predict the next best view near the agent's location, which is prone to getting stuck in local areas. Additionally, existing indoor datasets are insufficient due to limited geometric complexity and inaccurate ground truth meshes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel dataset AiMDoom with a map generator for the Doom video game, enabling to better benchmark active 3D mapping in diverse indoor environments. Moreover, we propose a new method we call next-best-path (NBP), which predicts long-term goals rather than focusing solely on short-sighted views. The model jointly predicts accumulated surface coverage gains for long-term goals and obstacle maps, allowing it to efficiently plan optimal paths with a unified model. By leveraging online data collection, data augmentation and curriculum learning, NBP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the existing MP3D dataset and our AiMDoom dataset, achieving more efficient mapping in indoor environments of varying complexity.
