- **Summary**: Infrared sensing is a core method for supporting unmanned systems, such as autonomous vehicles and drones. Recently, infrared sensors have been widely deployed on mobile and stationary platforms for detection and classification of objects from long distances and in wide field of views. Given its success in the vision image analysis domain, deep learning has also been applied for object recognition in infrared images. However, techniques that have proven successful in visible light perception face new challenges in the infrared domain. These challenges include extremely low signal-to-noise ratios in infrared images, very small and blurred objects of interest, and limited availability of labeled/unlabeled training data due to the specialized nature of infrared sensors. Numerous methods have been proposed in the literature for the detection and classification of small objects in infrared images achieving varied levels of success. There is a need for a survey paper that critically analyzes existing techniques in this domain, identifies unsolved challenges and provides future research directions. This paper fills the gap and offers a concise and insightful review of deep learning-based methods. It also identifies the challenges faced by existing infrared object segmentation methods and provides a structured review of existing infrared perception methods from the perspective of these challenges and highlights the motivations behind the various approaches. Finally, this review suggests promising future directions based on recent advancements within this domain.

- **Summary**: Talking head synthesis is to synthesize a lip-synchronized talking head video using audio. Recently, the capability of NeRF to enhance the realism and texture details of synthesized talking heads has attracted the attention of researchers. However, most current NeRF methods based on audio are exclusively concerned with the rendering of frontal faces. These methods are unable to generate clear talking heads in novel views. Another prevalent challenge in current 3D talking head synthesis is the difficulty in aligning acoustic and visual spaces, which often results in suboptimal lip-syncing of the generated talking heads. To address these issues, we propose Neural Radiance Field with 3D Prior Aided Audio Disentanglement for Talking Head Synthesis (NeRF-3DTalker). Specifically, the proposed method employs 3D prior information to synthesize clear talking heads with free views. Additionally, we propose a 3D Prior Aided Audio Disentanglement module, which is designed to disentangle the audio into two distinct categories: features related to 3D awarded speech movements and features related to speaking style. Moreover, to reposition the generated frames that are distant from the speaker's motion space in the real space, we have devised a local-global Standardized Space. This method normalizes the irregular positions in the generated frames from both global and local semantic perspectives. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, it has been demonstrated that our NeRF-3DTalker outperforms state-of-the-art in synthesizing realistic talking head videos, exhibiting superior image quality and lip synchronization.

- **Summary**: Understanding the relationship between the evolution of microstructures of irradiated LiAlO2 pellets and tritium diffusion, retention and release could improve predictions of tritium-producing burnable absorber rod performance. Given expert-labeled segmented images of irradiated and unirradiated pellets, we trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to segment images into defect, grain, and boundary classes. Qualitative microstructural information was calculated from these segmented images to facilitate the comparison of unirradiated and irradiated pellets. We tested modifications to improve the sensitivity of the model, including incorporating meta-data into the model and utilizing uncertainty quantification. The predicted segmentation was similar to the expert-labeled segmentation for most methods of microstructural qualification, including pixel proportion, defect area, and defect density. Overall, the high performance metrics for the best models for both irradiated and unirradiated images shows that utilizing neural network models is a viable alternative to expert-labeled images.

- **Summary**: 2D image coding for machines (ICM) has achieved great success in coding efficiency, while less effort has been devoted to stereo image fields. To promote the efficiency of stereo image compression (SIC) and intelligent analysis, the stereo image coding for machines (SICM) is formulated and explored in this paper. More specifically, a machine vision-oriented stereo feature compression network (MVSFC-Net) is proposed for SICM, where the stereo visual features are effectively extracted, compressed, and transmitted for 3D visual task. To efficiently compress stereo visual features in MVSFC-Net, a stereo multi-scale feature compression (SMFC) module is designed to gradually transform sparse stereo multi-scale features into compact joint visual representations by removing spatial, inter-view, and cross-scale redundancies simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed MVSFC-Net obtains superior compression efficiency as well as 3D visual task performance, when compared with the existing ICM anchors recommended by MPEG and the state-of-the-art SIC method.

- **Summary**: Reward models play an essential role in training vision-language models (VLMs) by assessing output quality to enable aligning with human preferences. Despite their importance, the research community lacks comprehensive open benchmarks for evaluating multimodal reward models in VLMs. To address this gap, we introduce Multimodal RewardBench, an expert-annotated benchmark covering six domains: general correctness, preference, knowledge, reasoning, safety, and visual question-answering. Our dataset comprises 5,211 annotated (prompt, chosen response, rejected response) triplets collected from various VLMs. In evaluating a range of VLM judges, we find that even the top-performing models, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieve only 72% overall accuracy. Notably, most models struggle in the reasoning and safety domains. These findings suggest that Multimodal RewardBench offers a challenging testbed for advancing reward model development across multiple domains. We release the benchmark at https://github.com/facebookresearch/multimodal_rewardbench.

- **Summary**: Mobile robots necessitate advanced natural language understanding capabilities to accurately identify locations and perform tasks such as package delivery. However, traditional visual place recognition (VPR) methods rely solely on single-view visual information and cannot interpret human language descriptions. To overcome this challenge, we bridge text and vision by proposing a multiview (360{\deg} views of the surroundings) text-vision registration approach called Text4VPR for place recognition task, which is the first method that exclusively utilizes textual descriptions to match a database of images. Text4VPR employs the frozen T5 language model to extract global textual embeddings. Additionally, it utilizes the Sinkhorn algorithm with temperature coefficient to assign local tokens to their respective clusters, thereby aggregating visual descriptors from images. During the training stage, Text4VPR emphasizes the alignment between individual text-image pairs for precise textual description. In the inference stage, Text4VPR uses the Cascaded Cross-Attention Cosine Alignment (CCCA) to address the internal mismatch between text and image groups. Subsequently, Text4VPR performs precisely place match based on the descriptions of text-image groups. On Street360Loc, the first text to image VPR dataset we created, Text4VPR builds a robust baseline, achieving a leading top-1 accuracy of 57% and a leading top-10 accuracy of 92% within a 5-meter radius on the test set, which indicates that localization from textual descriptions to images is not only feasible but also holds significant potential for further advancement, as shown in Figure 1.

- **Summary**: Image deblurring aims to reconstruct a latent sharp image from its corresponding blurred one. Although existing methods have achieved good performance, most of them operate exclusively in either the spatial domain or the frequency domain, rarely exploring solutions that fuse both domains. In this paper, we propose a spatial-frequency domain adaptive fusion network (SFAFNet) to address this limitation. Specifically, we design a gated spatial-frequency domain feature fusion block (GSFFBlock), which consists of three key components: a spatial domain information module, a frequency domain information dynamic generation module (FDGM), and a gated fusion module (GFM). The spatial domain information module employs the NAFBlock to integrate local information. Meanwhile, in the FDGM, we design a learnable low-pass filter that dynamically decomposes features into separate frequency subbands, capturing the image-wide receptive field and enabling the adaptive exploration of global contextual information. Additionally, to facilitate information flow and the learning of complementary representations. In the GFM, we present a gating mechanism (GATE) to re-weight spatial and frequency domain features, which are then fused through the cross-attention mechanism (CAM). Experimental results demonstrate that our SFAFNet performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) has gained significant attention as an alternative to traditional unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which relies on the constant availability of labeled source data. However, SFUDA approaches come with inherent limitations that are frequently overlooked. These challenges include performance degradation when the unlabeled target data fails to meet critical assumptions, such as having a closed-set label distribution identical to that of the source domain, or when sufficient unlabeled target data is unavailable-a common situation in real-world applications. To address these issues, we propose an asymmetric co-training (ACT) method specifically designed for the SFFSDA scenario. SFFSDA presents a more practical alternative to SFUDA, as gathering a few labeled target instances is more feasible than acquiring large volumes of unlabeled target data in many real-world contexts. Our ACT method begins by employing a weak-strong augmentation to enhance data diversity. Then we use a two-step optimization process to train the target model. In the first step, we optimize the label smoothing cross-entropy loss, the entropy of the class-conditional distribution, and the reverse-entropy loss to bolster the model's discriminative ability while mitigating overfitting. The second step focuses on reducing redundancy in the output space by minimizing classifier determinacy disparity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ACT approach, which outperforms state-of-the-art SFUDA methods and transfer learning techniques. Our findings suggest that adapting a source pre-trained model using only a small amount of labeled target data offers a practical and dependable solution.

- **Summary**: 3D landmark detection is a critical task in medical image analysis, and accurately detecting anatomical landmarks is essential for subsequent medical imaging tasks. However, mainstream deep learning methods in this field struggle to simultaneously capture fine-grained local features and model global spatial relationships, while maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Local feature extraction requires capturing fine-grained anatomical details, while global modeling requires understanding the spatial relationships within complex anatomical structures. The high-dimensional nature of 3D volume further exacerbates these challenges, as landmarks are sparsely distributed, leading to significant computational costs. Therefore, achieving efficient and precise 3D landmark detection remains a pressing challenge in medical image analysis.   In this work, We propose a \textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{3}D \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{Net}(H3DE-Net), a novel framework that combines CNNs for local feature extraction with a lightweight attention mechanism designed to efficiently capture global dependencies in 3D volumetric data. This mechanism employs a hierarchical routing strategy to reduce computational cost while maintaining global context modeling. To our knowledge, H3DE-Net is the first 3D landmark detection model that integrates such a lightweight attention mechanism with CNNs. Additionally, integrating multi-scale feature fusion further enhances detection accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on a public CT dataset demonstrate that H3DE-Net achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance, significantly improving accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with missing landmarks or complex anatomical variations. We aready open-source our project, including code, data and model weights.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with billions of model parameters form the backbone of popular image and video generation models like DALL.E, Stable-Diffusion and SORA. Though these models are necessary in many low-latency applications like Augmented/Virtual Reality, they cannot be deployed on resource-constrained Edge devices (like Apple Vision Pro or Meta Ray-Ban glasses) due to their huge computational complexity. To overcome this, we turn to knowledge distillation and perform a thorough design-space exploration to achieve the best DiT for a given parameter size. In particular, we provide principles for how to choose design knobs such as depth, width, attention heads and distillation setup for a DiT. During the process, a three-way trade-off emerges between model performance, size and speed that is crucial for Edge implementation of diffusion. We also propose two distillation approaches - Teaching Assistant (TA) method and Multi-In-One (MI1) method - to perform feature distillation in the DiT context. Unlike existing solutions, we demonstrate and benchmark the efficacy of our approaches on practical Edge devices such as NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.

- **Summary**: Accurate and realistic 3D scene reconstruction enables the lifelike creation of autonomous driving simulation environments. With advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), previous studies have applied it to reconstruct complex dynamic driving scenes. These methods typically require expensive LiDAR sensors and pre-annotated datasets of dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we propose OG-Gaussian, a novel approach that replaces LiDAR point clouds with Occupancy Grids (OGs) generated from surround-view camera images using Occupancy Prediction Network (ONet). Our method leverages the semantic information in OGs to separate dynamic vehicles from static street background, converting these grids into two distinct sets of initial point clouds for reconstructing both static and dynamic objects. Additionally, we estimate the trajectories and poses of dynamic objects through a learning-based approach, eliminating the need for complex manual annotations. Experiments on Waymo Open dataset demonstrate that OG-Gaussian is on par with the current state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality and rendering speed, achieving an average PSNR of 35.13 and a rendering speed of 143 FPS, while significantly reducing computational costs and economic overhead.

- **Summary**: This report presents a comprehensive framework for generating high-quality 3D shapes and textures from diverse input prompts, including single images, multi-view images, and text descriptions. The framework consists of 3D shape generation and texture generation. (1). The 3D shape generation pipeline employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode implicit 3D geometries into a latent space and a diffusion network to generate latents conditioned on input prompts, with modifications to enhance model capacity. An alternative Artist-Created Mesh (AM) generation approach is also explored, yielding promising results for simpler geometries. (2). Texture generation involves a multi-stage process starting with frontal images generation followed by multi-view images generation, RGB-to-PBR texture conversion, and high-resolution multi-view texture refinement. A consistency scheduler is plugged into every stage, to enforce pixel-wise consistency among multi-view textures during inference, ensuring seamless integration.   The pipeline demonstrates effective handling of diverse input formats, leveraging advanced neural architectures and novel methodologies to produce high-quality 3D content. This report details the system architecture, experimental results, and potential future directions to improve and expand the framework.

- **Summary**: Over the past decade, generative models have achieved significant success in enhancement fundus images.However, the evaluation of these models still presents a considerable challenge. A comprehensive evaluation benchmark for fundus image enhancement is indispensable for three main reasons: 1) The existing denoising metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) are hardly to extend to downstream real-world clinical research (e.g., Vessel morphology consistency). 2) There is a lack of comprehensive evaluation for both paired and unpaired enhancement methods, along with the need for expert protocols to accurately assess clinical value. 3) An ideal evaluation system should provide insights to inform future developments of fundus image enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel comprehensive benchmark, EyeBench, to provide insights that align enhancement models with clinical needs, offering a foundation for future work to improve the clinical relevance and applicability of generative models for fundus image enhancement. EyeBench has three appealing properties: 1) multi-dimensional clinical alignment downstream evaluation: In addition to evaluating the enhancement task, we provide several clinically significant downstream tasks for fundus images, including vessel segmentation, DR grading, denoising generalization, and lesion segmentation. 2) Medical expert-guided evaluation design: We introduce a novel dataset that promote comprehensive and fair comparisons between paired and unpaired methods and includes a manual evaluation protocol by medical experts. 3) Valuable insights: Our benchmark study provides a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of existing methods across different downstream tasks, assisting medical experts in making informed choices. Additionally, we offer further analysis of the challenges faced by existing methods. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Retinal-Research/EyeBench}

- **Summary**: Currency note recognition is a critical accessibility need for blind individuals, as identifying banknotes accurately can impact their independence and security in financial transactions. Several traditional and technological initiatives have been taken to date. Nevertheless, these approaches are less user-friendly and have made it more challenging for blind people to identify banknotes. This research proposes a user-friendly stand-alone system for the identification of Sri Lankan currency notes. A custom-created dataset of images of Sri Lankan currency notes was used to fine-tune an EfficientDet model. The currency note recognition model achieved 0.9847 AP on the validation dataset and performs exceptionally well in real-world scenarios. The high accuracy and the intuitive interface have enabled blind individuals to quickly and accurately identify currency denominations, ultimately encouraging accessibility and independence.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in event-based recognition have demonstrated significant promise, yet most existing approaches rely on extensive training, limiting their adaptability for efficient processing of event-driven visual content. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, but their application to event-based visual recognition remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{LLM-EvGen}, an event representation generator that produces LLM-compatible event representations \textbf{LLM-EvRep}, thereby enhancing the performance of LLMs on event recognition tasks. The generator is trained using a self-supervised framework, aligning the generated representations with semantic consistency and structural fidelity. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three datasets: N-ImageNet, N-Caltech101, and N-MNIST. The results demonstrate that our method, \textbf{LLM-EvRep}, outperforms the event-to-video method, E2VID, by 15.93\%, 0.82\%, and 50.21\%, respectively, in recognition tasks when evaluated using GPT-4o.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation is a rudimentary task in robotic perception. Recently, with the development of more accurate and robust neural network models and different types of datasets, monocular depth estimation has significantly improved performance and efficiency. However, most of the research in this area focuses on very concentrated domains. In particular, most of the benchmarks in outdoor scenarios belong to urban environments for the improvement of autonomous driving devices, and these benchmarks have a massive disparity with the orchard/vineyard environment, which is hardly helpful for research in the primary industry. Therefore, we propose OrchardDepth, which fills the gap in the estimation of the metric depth of the monocular camera in the orchard/vineyard environment. In addition, we present a new retraining method to improve the training result by monitoring the consistent regularization between dense depth maps and sparse points. Our method improves the RMSE of depth estimation in the orchard environment from 1.5337 to 0.6738, proving our method's validation.

- **Summary**: In the field of MLLM-based GUI agents, compared to smartphones, the PC scenario not only features a more complex interactive environment, but also involves more intricate intra- and inter-app workflows. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical agent framework named PC-Agent. Specifically, from the perception perspective, we devise an Active Perception Module (APM) to overcome the inadequate abilities of current MLLMs in perceiving screenshot content. From the decision-making perspective, to handle complex user instructions and interdependent subtasks more effectively, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent collaboration architecture that decomposes decision-making processes into Instruction-Subtask-Action levels. Within this architecture, three agents (i.e., Manager, Progress and Decision) are set up for instruction decomposition, progress tracking and step-by-step decision-making respectively. Additionally, a Reflection agent is adopted to enable timely bottom-up error feedback and adjustment. We also introduce a new benchmark PC-Eval with 25 real-world complex instructions. Empirical results on PC-Eval show that our PC-Agent achieves a 32% absolute improvement of task success rate over previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Textured 3D morphing creates smooth and plausible interpolation sequences between two 3D objects, focusing on transitions in both shape and texture. This is important for creative applications like visual effects in filmmaking. Previous methods rely on establishing point-to-point correspondences and determining smooth deformation trajectories, which inherently restrict them to shape-only morphing on untextured, topologically aligned datasets. This restriction leads to labor-intensive preprocessing and poor generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a method for 3D regenerative morphing using a 3D diffusion prior. Unlike previous methods that depend on explicit correspondences and deformations, our method eliminates the additional need for obtaining correspondence and uses the 3D diffusion prior to generate morphing. Specifically, we introduce a 3D diffusion model and interpolate the source and target information at three levels: initial noise, model parameters, and condition features. We then explore an Attention Fusion strategy to generate more smooth morphing sequences. To further improve the plausibility of semantic interpolation and the generated 3D surfaces, we propose two strategies: (a) Token Reordering, where we match approximate tokens based on semantic analysis to guide implicit correspondences in the denoising process of the diffusion model, and (b) Low-Frequency Enhancement, where we enhance low-frequency signals in the tokens to improve the quality of generated surfaces. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior smoothness and plausibility in 3D morphing across diverse cross-category object pairs, offering a novel regenerative method for 3D morphing with textured representations.

- **Summary**: With the widespread adoption and development of mobile devices, vision-based recognition applications have become a hot topic in research. Jade, as an important cultural heritage and artistic item, has significant applications in fields such as jewelry identification and cultural relic preservation. However, existing jade recognition systems still face challenges in mobile implementation, such as limited computing resources, real-time requirements, and accuracy issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a jade recognition system based on size model collaboration, aiming to achieve efficient and accurate jade identification using mobile devices such as smartphones.First, we design a size model based on multi-scale image processing, extracting key visual information by analyzing jade's dimensions, shapes, and surface textures. Then, a collaborative multi-model classification framework is built by combining deep learning and traditional computer vision algorithms. This framework can effectively select and adjust models based on different jade characteristics, providing high accuracy results across various environments and devices.Experimental results show that the proposed system can provide high recognition accuracy and fast processing time on mobile devices, while consuming relatively low computational resources. The system not only holds great application potential but also provides new ideas and technical support for the intelligent development of jade identification.

- **Summary**: Binary Spiking Neural Networks (BSNNs) inherit the eventdriven paradigm of SNNs, while also adopting the reduced storage burden of binarization techniques. These distinct advantages grant BSNNs lightweight and energy-efficient characteristics, rendering them ideal for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. However, due to the binary synaptic weights and non-differentiable spike function, effectively training BSNNs remains an open question. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the challenge for BSNN learning, namely the frequent weight sign flipping problem. To mitigate this issue, we propose an Adaptive Gradient Modulation Mechanism (AGMM), which is designed to reduce the frequency of weight sign flipping by adaptively adjusting the gradients during the learning process. The proposed AGMM can enable BSNNs to achieve faster convergence speed and higher accuracy, effectively narrowing the gap between BSNNs and their full-precision equivalents. We validate AGMM on both static and neuromorphic datasets, and results indicate that it achieves state-of-the-art results among BSNNs. This work substantially reduces storage demands and enhances SNNs' inherent energy efficiency, making them highly feasible for resource-constrained environments.

- **Summary**: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging plays a crucial role in modern medical diagnostics by revealing the metabolic processes within a patient's body, which is essential for quantification of therapy response and monitoring treatment progress. However, the segmentation of PET images presents unique challenges due to their lower contrast and less distinct boundaries compared to other structural medical modalities. Recent developments in segmentation foundation models have shown superior versatility across diverse natural image segmentation tasks. Despite the efforts of medical adaptations, these works primarily focus on structural medical images with detailed physiological structural information and exhibit poor generalization ability when adapted to molecular PET imaging. In this paper, we collect and construct PETS-5k, the largest PET segmentation dataset to date, comprising 5,731 three-dimensional whole-body PET images and encompassing over 1.3M 2D images. Based on the established dataset, we develop SegAnyPET, a modality-specific 3D foundation model for universal promptable segmentation from PET images. To issue the challenge of discrepant annotation quality of PET images, we adopt a cross prompting confident learning (CPCL) strategy with an uncertainty-guided self-rectification process to robustly learn segmentation from high-quality labeled data and low-quality noisy labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that SegAnyPET can correctly segment seen and unseen targets using only one or a few prompt points, outperforming state-of-the-art foundation models and task-specific fully supervised models with higher accuracy and strong generalization ability for universal segmentation. As the first foundation model for PET images, we believe that SegAnyPET will advance the applications to various downstream tasks for molecular imaging.

- **Summary**: Sparsity-based tensor recovery methods have shown great potential in suppressing seismic data noise. These methods exploit tensor sparsity measures capturing the low-dimensional structures inherent in seismic data tensors to remove noise by applying sparsity constraints through soft-thresholding or hard-thresholding operators. However, in these methods, considering that real seismic data are non-stationary and affected by noise, the variances of tensor coefficients are unknown and may be difficult to accurately estimate from the degraded seismic data, leading to undesirable noise suppression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel triply Laplacian scale mixture (TLSM) approach for seismic data noise suppression, which significantly improves the estimation accuracy of both the sparse tensor coefficients and hidden scalar parameters. To make the optimization problem manageable, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed to solve the proposed TLSM-based seismic data noise suppression problem. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and field seismic data demonstrate that the proposed TLSM algorithm outperforms many state-of-the-art seismic data noise suppression methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations while providing exceptional computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: In this paper we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for weed detection in agricultural land. We specifically investigate the application of two CNN layer types, Conv2d and dilated Conv2d, for weed detection in crop fields. The suggested method extracts features from the input photos using pre-trained models, which are subsequently adjusted for weed detection. The findings of the experiment, which used a sizable collection of dataset consisting of 15336 segments, being 3249 of soil, 7376 of soybean, 3520 grass and 1191 of broadleaf weeds. show that the suggested approach can accurately and successfully detect weeds at an accuracy of 94%. This study has significant ramifications for lowering the usage of toxic herbicides and increasing the effectiveness of weed management in agriculture.

- **Summary**: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients often undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which can lead to postoperative complications such as limited mouth opening and joint stiffness, particularly in recurrent cases that require re-surgery. These complications can affect airway function, making accurate postoperative airway risk assessment essential for managing patient care. Accurate segmentation of airway-related structures in postoperative CT scans is crucial for assessing these risks. This study introduces TopoWMamba (Topology-aware Wavelet Mamba), a novel segmentation model specifically designed to address the challenges of postoperative airway risk evaluation in recurrent NPC patients. TopoWMamba combines wavelet-based multi-scale feature extraction, state-space sequence modeling, and topology-aware modules to segment airway-related structures in CT scans robustly. By leveraging the Wavelet-based Mamba Block (WMB) for hierarchical frequency decomposition and the Snake Conv VSS (SCVSS) module to preserve anatomical continuity, TopoWMamba effectively captures both fine-grained boundaries and global structural context, crucial for accurate segmentation in complex postoperative scenarios. Through extensive testing on the NPCSegCT dataset, TopoWMamba achieves an average Dice score of 88.02%, outperforming existing models such as UNet, Attention UNet, and SwinUNet. Additionally, TopoWMamba is tested on the SegRap 2023 Challenge dataset, where it shows a significant improvement in trachea segmentation with a Dice score of 95.26%. The proposed model provides a strong foundation for automated segmentation, enabling more accurate postoperative airway risk evaluation.

- **Summary**: Model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy risk by attempting to reconstruct private training data from trained models. Most of the existing methods either depend on gradient estimation or require white-box access to model parameters, which limits their applicability in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose PPO-MI, a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for black-box model inversion attacks. Our approach formulates the inversion task as a Markov Decision Process, where an agent navigates the latent space of a generative model to reconstruct private training samples using only model predictions. By employing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a momentum-based state transition mechanism, along with a reward function balancing prediction accuracy and exploration, PPO-MI ensures efficient latent space exploration and high query efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments illustrates that PPO-MI outperforms the existing methods while require less attack knowledge, and it is robust across various model architectures and datasets. These results underline its effectiveness and generalizability in practical black-box scenarios, raising important considerations for the privacy vulnerabilities of deployed machine learning models.



### CrossVTON: Mimicking the Logic Reasoning on Cross-category Virtual Try-on guided by Tri-zone Priors

- **Summary**: Despite remarkable progress in image-based virtual try-on systems, generating realistic and robust fitting images for cross-category virtual try-on remains a challenging task. The primary difficulty arises from the absence of human-like reasoning, which involves addressing size mismatches between garments and models while recognizing and leveraging the distinct functionalities of various regions within the model images. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from human cognitive processes and disentangle the complex reasoning required for cross-category try-on into a structured framework. This framework systematically decomposes the model image into three distinct regions: try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones. Each zone plays a specific role in accommodating the garment and facilitating realistic synthesis. To endow the model with robust reasoning capabilities for cross-category scenarios, we propose an iterative data constructor. This constructor encompasses diverse scenarios, including intra-category try-on, any-to-dress transformations (replacing any garment category with a dress), and dress-to-any transformations (replacing a dress with another garment category). Utilizing the generated dataset, we introduce a tri-zone priors generator that intelligently predicts the try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones by analyzing how the input garment is expected to align with the model image. Guided by these tri-zone priors, our proposed method, CrossVTON, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, it demonstrates superior capability in handling cross-category virtual try-on, meeting the complex demands of real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising method for adapting pre-trained visual-language models (VLMs) to a range of downstream tasks. While optimizing the context can be effective for improving performance on specific tasks, it can often lead to poor generalization performance on unseen classes or datasets sampled from different distributions. It may be attributed to the fact that textual prompts tend to overfit downstream data distributions, leading to the forgetting of generalized knowledge derived from hand-crafted prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Similarity Paradigm with Textual Regularization (SPTR) for prompt learning without forgetting. SPTR is a two-pronged design based on hand-crafted prompts that is an inseparable framework. 1) To avoid forgetting general textual knowledge, we introduce the optimal transport as a textual regularization to finely ensure approximation with hand-crafted features and tuning textual features. 2) In order to continuously unleash the general ability of multiple hand-crafted prompts, we propose a similarity paradigm for natural alignment score and adversarial alignment score to improve model robustness for generalization. Both modules share a common objective in addressing generalization issues, aiming to maximize the generalization capability derived from multiple hand-crafted prompts. Four representative tasks (i.e., non-generalization few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset generalization, domain generalization) across 11 datasets demonstrate that SPTR outperforms existing prompt learning methods.

- **Summary**: The Diffusion Transformer plays a pivotal role in advancing text-to-image and text-to-video generation, owing primarily to its inherent scalability. However, existing controlled diffusion transformer methods incur significant parameter and computational overheads and suffer from inefficient resource allocation due to their failure to account for the varying relevance of control information across different transformer layers. To address this, we propose the Relevance-Guided Efficient Controllable Generation framework, RelaCtrl, enabling efficient and resource-optimized integration of control signals into the Diffusion Transformer. First, we evaluate the relevance of each layer in the Diffusion Transformer to the control information by assessing the "ControlNet Relevance Score"-i.e., the impact of skipping each control layer on both the quality of generation and the control effectiveness during inference. Based on the strength of the relevance, we then tailor the positioning, parameter scale, and modeling capacity of the control layers to reduce unnecessary parameters and redundant computations. Additionally, to further improve efficiency, we replace the self-attention and FFN in the commonly used copy block with the carefully designed Two-Dimensional Shuffle Mixer (TDSM), enabling efficient implementation of both the token mixer and channel mixer. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance with only 15% of the parameters and computational complexity compared to PixArt-delta.

- **Summary**: We introduce PhotoDoodle, a novel image editing framework designed to facilitate photo doodling by enabling artists to overlay decorative elements onto photographs. Photo doodling is challenging because the inserted elements must appear seamlessly integrated with the background, requiring realistic blending, perspective alignment, and contextual coherence. Additionally, the background must be preserved without distortion, and the artist's unique style must be captured efficiently from limited training data. These requirements are not addressed by previous methods that primarily focus on global style transfer or regional inpainting. The proposed method, PhotoDoodle, employs a two-stage training strategy. Initially, we train a general-purpose image editing model, OmniEditor, using large-scale data. Subsequently, we fine-tune this model with EditLoRA using a small, artist-curated dataset of before-and-after image pairs to capture distinct editing styles and techniques. To enhance consistency in the generated results, we introduce a positional encoding reuse mechanism. Additionally, we release a PhotoDoodle dataset featuring six high-quality styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advanced performance and robustness of our method in customized image editing, opening new possibilities for artistic creation.

- **Summary**: Recent research in medical image analysis with deep learning almost exclusively focuses on grid- or voxel-based data representations. We challenge this common choice by introducing MedFuncta, a modality-agnostic continuous data representation based on neural fields. We demonstrate how to scale neural fields from single instances to large datasets by exploiting redundancy in medical signals and by applying an efficient meta-learning approach with a context reduction scheme. We further address the spectral bias in commonly used SIREN activations, by introducing an $\omega_0$-schedule, improving reconstruction quality and convergence speed. We validate our proposed approach on a large variety of medical signals of different dimensions and modalities (1D: ECG; 2D: Chest X-ray, Retinal OCT, Fundus Camera, Dermatoscope, Colon Histopathology, Cell Microscopy; 3D: Brain MRI, Lung CT) and successfully demonstrate that we can solve relevant downstream tasks on these representations. We additionally release a large-scale dataset of > 550k annotated neural fields to promote research in this direction.

- **Summary**: The prevalence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) raises important questions about privacy in an era where visual information is increasingly available. While foundation VLMs demonstrate broad knowledge and learned capabilities, we specifically investigate their ability to infer geographic location from previously unseen image data. This paper introduces a benchmark dataset collected from Google Street View that represents its global distribution of coverage. Foundation models are evaluated on single-image geolocation inference, with many achieving median distance errors of <300 km. We further evaluate VLM "agents" with access to supplemental tools, observing up to a 30.6% decrease in distance error. Our findings establish that modern foundation VLMs can act as powerful image geolocation tools, without being specifically trained for this task. When coupled with increasing accessibility of these models, our findings have greater implications for online privacy. We discuss these risks, as well as future work in this area.

- **Summary**: Real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rtMRI) is frequently used in speech production studies as it provides a complete view of the vocal tract during articulation. This study investigates the effectiveness of rtMRI in analyzing vocal tract movements by employing the SegNet and UNet models for Air-Tissue Boundary (ATB)segmentation tasks. We conducted pretraining of a few base models using increasing numbers of subjects and videos, to assess performance on two datasets. First, consisting of unseen subjects with unseen videos from the same data source, achieving 0.33% and 0.91% (Pixel-wise Classification Accuracy (PCA) and Dice Coefficient respectively) better than its matched condition. Second, comprising unseen videos from a new data source, where we obtained an accuracy of 99.63% and 98.09% (PCA and Dice Coefficient respectively) of its matched condition performance. Here, matched condition performance refers to the performance of a model trained only on the test subjects which was set as a benchmark for the other models. Our findings highlight the significance of fine-tuning and adapting models with limited data. Notably, we demonstrated that effective model adaptation can be achieved with as few as 15 rtMRI frames from any new dataset.

- **Summary**: Humans possess a unified cognitive ability to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. Why can't large language models replicate this holistic understanding? Through a systematic analysis of existing training paradigms in vision-language-action models (VLA), we identify two key challenges: spurious forgetting, where robot training overwrites crucial visual-text alignments, and task interference, where competing control and understanding tasks degrade performance when trained jointly. To overcome these limitations, we propose ChatVLA, a novel framework featuring Phased Alignment Training, which incrementally integrates multimodal data after initial control mastery, and a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to minimize task interference. ChatVLA demonstrates competitive performance on visual question-answering datasets and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) methods on multimodal understanding benchmarks. Notably, it achieves a six times higher performance on MMMU and scores 47.2% on MMStar with a more parameter-efficient design than ECoT. Furthermore, ChatVLA demonstrates superior performance on 25 real-world robot manipulation tasks compared to existing VLA methods like OpenVLA. Our findings highlight the potential of our unified framework for achieving both robust multimodal understanding and effective robot control.

- **Summary**: Many real-world applications rely on land surface temperature (LST) data at high spatiotemporal resolution. In complex urban areas, LST exhibits significant variations, fluctuating dramatically within and across city blocks. Landsat provides high spatial resolution data at 100 meters but is limited by long revisit time, with cloud cover further disrupting data collection. Here, we propose DELAG, a deep ensemble learning method that integrates annual temperature cycles and Gaussian processes, to reconstruct Landsat LST in complex urban areas. Leveraging the cross-track characteristics and dual-satellite operation of Landsat since 2021, we further enhance data availability to 4 scenes every 16 days. We select New York City, London and Hong Kong from three different continents as study areas. Experiments show that DELAG successfully reconstructed LST in the three cities under clear-sky (RMSE = 0.73-0.96 K) and heavily-cloudy (RMSE = 0.84-1.62 K) situations, superior to existing methods. Additionally, DELAG can quantify uncertainty that enhances LST reconstruction reliability. We further tested the reconstructed LST to estimate near-surface air temperature, achieving results (RMSE = 1.48-2.11 K) comparable to those derived from clear-sky LST (RMSE = 1.63-2.02 K). The results demonstrate the successful reconstruction through DELAG and highlight the broader applications of LST reconstruction for estimating accurate air temperature. Our study thus provides a novel and practical method for Landsat LST reconstruction, particularly suited for complex urban areas within Landsat cross-track areas, taking one step toward addressing complex climate events at high spatiotemporal resolution.

- **Summary**: Stochastic resonance describes the utility of noise in improving the detectability of weak signals in certain types of systems. It has been observed widely in natural and engineered settings, but its utility in image classification with rate-based neural networks has not been studied extensively. In this analysis a simple LSTM recurrent neural network is trained for digit recognition and classification. During the test phase, image contrast is reduced to a point where the model fails to recognize the presence of a stimulus. Controlled noise is added to partially recover classification performance. The results indicate the presence of stochastic resonance in rate-based recurrent neural networks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose DeepDeblurRF, a novel radiance field deblurring approach that can synthesize high-quality novel views from blurred training views with significantly reduced training time. DeepDeblurRF leverages deep neural network (DNN)-based deblurring modules to enjoy their deblurring performance and computational efficiency. To effectively combine DNN-based deblurring and radiance field construction, we propose a novel radiance field (RF)-guided deblurring and an iterative framework that performs RF-guided deblurring and radiance field construction in an alternating manner. Moreover, DeepDeblurRF is compatible with various scene representations, such as voxel grids and 3D Gaussians, expanding its applicability. We also present BlurRF-Synth, the first large-scale synthetic dataset for training radiance field deblurring frameworks. We conduct extensive experiments on both camera motion blur and defocus blur, demonstrating that DeepDeblurRF achieves state-of-the-art novel-view synthesis quality with significantly reduced training time.

- **Summary**: Flatbed scanners have emerged as promising devices for high-resolution, single-image material capture. However, existing approaches assume very specific conditions, such as uniform diffuse illumination, which are only available in certain high-end devices, hindering their scalability and cost. In contrast, in this work, we introduce a method inspired by intrinsic image decomposition, which accurately removes both shading and specularity, effectively allowing captures with any flatbed scanner. Further, we extend previous work on single-image material reflectance capture with the estimation of opacity and transmittance, critical components of full material appearance (SVBSDF), improving the results for any material captured with a flatbed scanner, at a very high resolution and accuracy

- **Summary**: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains a challenging problem due to the subtle visual differences between camouflaged objects and backgrounds. Owing to the exceedingly limited visual cues available from visible spectrum, previous RGB single-modality approaches often struggle to achieve satisfactory results, prompting the exploration of multimodal data to enhance detection accuracy. In this work, we present UniCOS, a novel framework that effectively leverages diverse data modalities to improve segmentation performance. UniCOS comprises two key components: a multimodal segmentor, UniSEG, and a cross-modal knowledge learning module, UniLearner. UniSEG employs a state space fusion mechanism to integrate cross-modal features within a unified state space, enhancing contextual understanding and improving robustness to integration of heterogeneous data. Additionally, it includes a fusion-feedback mechanism that facilitate feature extraction. UniLearner exploits multimodal data unrelated to the COS task to improve the segmentation ability of the COS models by generating pseudo-modal content and cross-modal semantic associations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniSEG outperforms existing Multimodal COS (MCOS) segmentors, regardless of whether real or pseudo-multimodal COS data is available. Moreover, in scenarios where multimodal COS data is unavailable but multimodal non-COS data is accessible, UniLearner effectively exploits these data to enhance segmentation performance. Our code will be made publicly available on \href{https://github.com/cnyvfang/UniCOS}{GitHub}.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a more energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by mimicking biological neural principles, establishing them as a promising approach to mitigate the increasing energy demands of large-scale neural models. However, fully harnessing the capabilities of SNNs remains challenging due to their discrete signal processing and temporal dynamics. ANN-SNN conversion has emerged as a practical approach, enabling SNNs to achieve competitive performance on complex machine learning tasks. In this work, we identify a phenomenon in the ANN-SNN conversion framework, termed temporal misalignment, in which random spike rearrangement across SNN layers leads to performance improvements. Based on this observation, we introduce biologically plausible two-phase probabilistic (TPP) spiking neurons, further enhancing the conversion process. We demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method both theoretically and empirically through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet across a variety of architectures, achieving state-of-the-art results.

  infrared and visible image fusion
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is increasingly applied in critical fields such as video surveillance and autonomous driving systems. Significant progress has been made in deep learning-based fusion methods. However, these models frequently encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes in real-world applications, which severely impact their performance and reliability. Therefore, addressing the challenge of OOD data is crucial for the safe deployment of these models in open-world environments. Unlike existing research, our focus is on the challenges posed by OOD data in real-world applications and on enhancing the robustness and generalization of models. In this paper, we propose an infrared-visible fusion framework based on Multi-View Augmentation. For external data augmentation, Top-k Selective Vision Alignment is employed to mitigate distribution shifts between datasets by performing RGB-wise transformations on visible images. This strategy effectively introduces augmented samples, enhancing the adaptability of the model to complex real-world scenarios. Additionally, for internal data augmentation, self-supervised learning is established using Weak-Aggressive Augmentation. This enables the model to learn more robust and general feature representations during the fusion process, thereby improving robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance and robustness across various conditions and environments. Our approach significantly enhances the reliability and stability of IVIF tasks in practical applications.

- **Summary**: UAV-borne hyperspectral remote sensing has emerged as a promising approach for underwater target detection (UTD). However, its effectiveness is hindered by spectral distortions in nearshore environments, which compromise the accuracy of traditional hyperspectral UTD (HUTD) methods that rely on bathymetric model. These distortions lead to significant uncertainty in target and background spectra, challenging the detection process. To address this, we propose the Hyperspectral Underwater Contrastive Learning Network (HUCLNet), a novel framework that integrates contrastive learning with a self-paced learning paradigm for robust HUTD in nearshore regions. HUCLNet extracts discriminative features from distorted hyperspectral data through contrastive learning, while the self-paced learning strategy selectively prioritizes the most informative samples. Additionally, a reliability-guided clustering strategy enhances the robustness of learned representations.To evaluate the method effectiveness, we conduct a novel nearshore HUTD benchmark dataset, ATR2-HUTD, covering three diverse scenarios with varying water types and turbidity, and target types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HUCLNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The dataset and code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/qjh1996/HUTD

- **Summary**: As the previous state-of-the-art 4D radar-camera fusion-based 3D object detection method, LXL utilizes the predicted image depth distribution maps and radar 3D occupancy grids to assist the sampling-based image view transformation. However, the depth prediction lacks accuracy and consistency, and the concatenation-based fusion in LXL impedes the model robustness. In this work, we propose LXLv2, where modifications are made to overcome the limitations and improve the performance. Specifically, considering the position error in radar measurements, we devise a one-to-many depth supervision strategy via radar points, where the radar cross section (RCS) value is further exploited to adjust the supervision area for object-level depth consistency. Additionally, a channel and spatial attention-based fusion module named CSAFusion is introduced to improve feature adaptiveness. Experimental results on the View-of-Delft and TJ4DRadSet datasets show that the proposed LXLv2 can outperform LXL in detection accuracy, inference speed and robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of multimodal tasks. However, their inference efficiency is constrained by the large number of visual tokens processed during decoding. To address this challenge, we propose Per-Layer Per-Head Vision Token Pruning (PLPHP), a two-level fine-grained pruning method including Layer-Level Retention Rate Allocation and Head-Level Vision Token Pruning. Motivated by the Vision Token Re-attention phenomenon across decoder layers, we dynamically adjust token retention rates layer by layer. Layers that exhibit stronger attention to visual information preserve more vision tokens, while layers with lower vision attention are aggressively pruned. Furthermore, PLPHP applies pruning at the attention head level, enabling different heads within the same layer to independently retain critical context. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PLPHP delivers an 18% faster decoding speed and reduces the Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) size by over 50%, all at the cost of 0.46% average performance drop, while also achieving notable performance improvements in multi-image tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness of fine-grained token pruning and contribute to advancing the efficiency and scalability of LVLMs. Our source code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Comprehensive legal medicine documentation includes both an internal but also an external examination of the corpse. Typically, this documentation is conducted manually during conventional autopsy. A systematic digital documentation would be desirable, especially for the external examination of wounds, which is becoming more relevant for legal medicine analysis. For this purpose, RGB surface scanning has been introduced. While a manual full surface scan using a handheld camera is timeconsuming and operator dependent, floor or ceiling mounted robotic systems require substantial space and a dedicated room. Hence, we consider whether a mobile robotic system can be used for external documentation. Methods: We develop a mobile robotic system that enables full-body RGB-D surface scanning. Our work includes a detailed configuration space analysis to identify the environmental parameters that need to be considered to successfully perform a surface scan. We validate our findings through an experimental study in the lab and demonstrate the system's application in a legal medicine environment. Results: Our configuration space analysis shows that a good trade-off between coverage and time is reached with three robot base positions, leading to a coverage of 94.96 %. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the system in accurately capturing body surface geometry with an average surface coverage of 96.90 +- 3.16 % and 92.45 +- 1.43 % for a body phantom and actual corpses, respectively. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of a mobile robotic system to automate RGB-D surface scanning in legal medicine, complementing the use of post-mortem CT scans for inner documentation. Our results indicate that the proposed system can contribute to more efficient and autonomous legal medicine documentation, reducing the need for manual intervention.

- **Summary**: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) provides comprehensive scene geometry and semantics for autonomous driving perception, which is crucial for enabling accurate and reliable decision-making. However, existing SSC methods are limited to capturing sparse information from the current frame or naively stacking multi-frame temporal features, thereby failing to acquire effective scene context. These approaches ignore critical motion dynamics and struggle to achieve temporal consistency. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel temporal SSC method FlowScene: Learning Temporal 3D Semantic Scene Completion via Optical Flow Guidance. By leveraging optical flow, FlowScene can integrate motion, different viewpoints, occlusions, and other contextual cues, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of 3D scene completion. Specifically, our framework introduces two key components: (1) a Flow-Guided Temporal Aggregation module that aligns and aggregates temporal features using optical flow, capturing motion-aware context and deformable structures; and (2) an Occlusion-Guided Voxel Refinement module that injects occlusion masks and temporally aggregated features into 3D voxel space, adaptively refining voxel representations for explicit geometric modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowScene achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SSMDE) aims to predict the dense depth map of a monocular image, by learning depth from RGB image sequences, eliminating the need for ground-truth depth labels. Although this approach simplifies data acquisition compared to supervised methods, it struggles with reflective surfaces, as they violate the assumptions of Lambertian reflectance, leading to inaccurate training on such surfaces. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel training strategy for an SSMDE by leveraging triplet mining to pinpoint reflective regions at the pixel level, guided by the camera geometry between different viewpoints. The proposed reflection-aware triplet mining loss specifically penalizes the inappropriate photometric error minimization on the localized reflective regions while preserving depth accuracy in non-reflective areas. We also incorporate a reflection-aware knowledge distillation method that enables a student model to selectively learn the pixel-level knowledge from reflective and non-reflective regions. This results in robust depth estimation across areas. Evaluation results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method effectively enhances depth quality on reflective surfaces and outperforms state-of-the-art SSMDE baselines.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), particularly Vision Transformers (ViT) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), has sparked significant advances in the field of medical image analysis. These models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in capturing long-range dependencies and achieving high generalization in segmentation tasks. However, adapting these large models to medical image analysis presents several challenges, including domain differences between medical and natural images, the need for efficient model adaptation strategies, and the limitations of small-scale medical datasets. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on the adaptation of VFMs to medical image segmentation, focusing on the challenges of domain adaptation, model compression, and federated learning. We discuss the latest developments in adapter-based improvements, knowledge distillation techniques, and multi-scale contextual feature modeling, and propose future directions to overcome these bottlenecks. Our analysis highlights the potential of VFMs, along with emerging methodologies such as federated learning and model compression, to revolutionize medical image analysis and enhance clinical applications. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview of current approaches and suggest key areas for future research that can drive the next wave of innovation in medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Transparent object perception is indispensable for numerous robotic tasks. However, accurately segmenting and estimating the depth of transparent objects remain challenging due to complex optical properties. Existing methods primarily delve into only one task using extra inputs or specialized sensors, neglecting the valuable interactions among tasks and the subsequent refinement process, leading to suboptimal and blurry predictions. To address these issues, we propose a monocular framework, which is the first to excel in both segmentation and depth estimation of transparent objects, with only a single-image input. Specifically, we devise a novel semantic and geometric fusion module, effectively integrating the multi-scale information between tasks. In addition, drawing inspiration from human perception of objects, we further incorporate an iterative strategy, which progressively refines initial features for clearer results. Experiments on two challenging synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art monocular, stereo, and multi-view methods by a large margin of about 38.8%-46.2% with only a single RGB input.

- **Summary**: Image geo-localization is the task of predicting the specific location of an image and requires complex reasoning across visual, geographical, and cultural contexts. While prior Vision Language Models (VLMs) have the best accuracy at this task, there is a dearth of high-quality datasets and models for analytical reasoning. We first create NaviClues, a high-quality dataset derived from GeoGuessr, a popular geography game, to supply examples of expert reasoning from language. Using this dataset, we present Navig, a comprehensive image geo-localization framework integrating global and fine-grained image information. By reasoning with language, Navig reduces the average distance error by 14% compared to previous state-of-the-art models while requiring fewer than 1000 training samples. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/SparrowZheyuan18/Navig/.

- **Summary**: Volume Interpolated Breath-Hold Examination (VIBE) MRI generates images suitable for water and fat signal composition estimation. While the two-point VIBE provides water-fat-separated images, the six-point VIBE allows estimation of the effective transversal relaxation rate R2* and the proton density fat fraction (PDFF), which are imaging markers for health and disease. Ambiguity during signal reconstruction can lead to water-fat swaps. This shortcoming challenges the application of VIBE-MRI for automated PDFF analyses of large-scale clinical data and of population studies. This study develops an automated pipeline to detect and correct water-fat swaps in non-contrast-enhanced VIBE images. Our three-step pipeline begins with training a segmentation network to classify volumes as "fat-like" or "water-like," using synthetic water-fat swaps generated by merging fat and water volumes with Perlin noise. Next, a denoising diffusion image-to-image network predicts water volumes as signal priors for correction. Finally, we integrate this prior into a physics-constrained model to recover accurate water and fat signals. Our approach achieves a < 1% error rate in water-fat swap detection for a 6-point VIBE. Notably, swaps disproportionately affect individuals in the Underweight and Class 3 Obesity BMI categories. Our correction algorithm ensures accurate solution selection in chemical phase MRIs, enabling reliable PDFF estimation. This forms a solid technical foundation for automated large-scale population imaging analysis.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction allows better decision-making in applications of autonomous vehicles or surveillance by predicting the short-term future movement of traffic agents. It is classified into pedestrian or heterogeneous trajectory prediction. The former exploits the relatively consistent behavior of pedestrians, but is limited in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous traffic agents such as cyclists and vehicles. The latter typically relies on extra class label information to distinguish the heterogeneous agents, but such labels are costly to annotate and cannot be generalized to represent different behaviors within the same class of agents. In this work, we introduce the behavioral pseudo-labels that effectively capture the behavior distributions of pedestrians and heterogeneous agents solely based on their motion features, significantly improving the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To implement the framework, we propose the Behavioral Pseudo-Label Informed Sparse Graph Convolution Network (BP-SGCN) that learns pseudo-labels and informs to a trajectory predictor. For optimization, we propose a cascaded training scheme, in which we first learn the pseudo-labels in an unsupervised manner, and then perform end-to-end fine-tuning on the labels in the direction of increasing the trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that our pseudo-labels effectively model different behavior clusters and improve trajectory prediction. Our proposed BP-SGCN outperforms existing methods using both pedestrian (ETH/UCY, pedestrian-only SDD) and heterogeneous agent datasets (SDD, Argoverse 1).

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown significant advantages in novel view synthesis (NVS), particularly in achieving high rendering speeds and high-quality results. However, its geometric accuracy in 3D reconstruction remains limited due to the lack of explicit geometric constraints during optimization. This paper introduces CDGS, a confidence-aware depth regularization approach developed to enhance 3DGS. We leverage multi-cue confidence maps of monocular depth estimation and sparse Structure-from-Motion depth to adaptively adjust depth supervision during the optimization process. Our method demonstrates improved geometric detail preservation in early training stages and achieves competitive performance in both NVS quality and geometric accuracy. Experiments on the publicly available Tanks and Temples benchmark dataset show that our method achieves more stable convergence behavior and more accurate geometric reconstruction results, with improvements of up to 2.31 dB in PSNR for NVS and consistently lower geometric errors in M3C2 distance metrics. Notably, our method reaches comparable F-scores to the original 3DGS with only 50% of the training iterations. We expect this work will facilitate the development of efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction systems for real-world applications such as digital twin creation, heritage preservation, or forestry applications.

- **Summary**: The significant effort required to annotate data for new training datasets hinders computer vision research and machine learning in the construction industry. This work explores adapting standard datasets and the latest transformer model architectures for point cloud semantic segmentation in the context of shell construction sites. Unlike common approaches focused on object segmentation of building interiors and furniture, this study addressed the challenges of segmenting complex structural components in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC). We establish a baseline through supervised training and a custom validation dataset, evaluate the cross-domain inference with large-scale indoor datasets, and utilize transfer learning to maximize segmentation performance with minimal new data. The findings indicate that with minimal fine-tuning, pre-trained transformer architectures offer an effective strategy for building component segmentation. Our results are promising for automating the annotation of new, previously unseen data when creating larger training resources and for the segmentation of frequently recurring objects.

- **Summary**: Medical images are acquired at high resolutions with large fields of view in order to capture fine-grained features necessary for clinical decision-making. Consequently, training deep learning models on medical images can incur large computational costs. In this work, we address the challenge of downsizing medical images in order to improve downstream computational efficiency while preserving clinically-relevant features. We introduce MedVAE, a family of six large-scale 2D and 3D autoencoders capable of encoding medical images as downsized latent representations and decoding latent representations back to high-resolution images. We train MedVAE autoencoders using a novel two-stage training approach with 1,052,730 medical images. Across diverse tasks obtained from 20 medical image datasets, we demonstrate that (1) utilizing MedVAE latent representations in place of high-resolution images when training downstream models can lead to efficiency benefits (up to 70x improvement in throughput) while simultaneously preserving clinically-relevant features and (2) MedVAE can decode latent representations back to high-resolution images with high fidelity. Our work demonstrates that large-scale, generalizable autoencoders can help address critical efficiency challenges in the medical domain.

- **Summary**: Class-incremental learning requires models to continually acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Although pre-trained models have demonstrated strong performance in class-incremental learning, they remain susceptible to catastrophic forgetting when learning new concepts. Excessive plasticity in the models breaks generalizability and causes forgetting, while strong stability results in insufficient adaptation to new classes. This necessitates effective adaptation with minimal modifications to preserve the general knowledge of pre-trained models. To address this challenge, we first introduce a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning module 'Learn and Calibrate', or LuCA, designed to acquire knowledge through an adapter-calibrator couple, enabling effective adaptation with well-refined feature representations. Second, for each learning session, we deploy a sparse LuCA module on top of the last token just before the classifier, which we refer to as 'Token-level Sparse Calibration and Adaptation', or TOSCA. This strategic design improves the orthogonality between the modules and significantly reduces both training and inference complexity. By leaving the generalization capabilities of the pre-trained models intact and adapting exclusively via the last token, our approach achieves a harmonious balance between stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments demonstrate TOSCA's state-of-the-art performance while introducing ~8 times fewer parameters compared to prior methods.

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated strong performance in English, but their effectiveness in Japanese remains limited due to the lack of high-quality training data. Current Japanese LMMs often rely on translated English datasets, restricting their ability to capture Japan-specific cultural knowledge. To address this, we explore the potential of Japanese PDF data as a training resource, an area that remains largely underutilized. We introduce a fully automated pipeline that leverages pretrained models to extract image-text pairs from PDFs through layout analysis, OCR, and vision-language pairing, removing the need for manual annotation. Additionally, we construct instruction data from extracted image-text pairs to enrich the training data. To evaluate the effectiveness of PDF-derived data, we train Japanese LMMs and assess their performance on the Japanese LMM Benchmark. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements, with performance gains ranging from 3.9% to 13.8% on Heron-Bench. Further analysis highlights the impact of PDF-derived data on various factors, such as model size and language models, reinforcing its value as a multimodal resource for Japanese LMMs. We plan to make the source code and data publicly available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce DC (Decouple)-ControlNet, a highly flexible and precisely controllable framework for multi-condition image generation. The core idea behind DC-ControlNet is to decouple control conditions, transforming global control into a hierarchical system that integrates distinct elements, contents, and layouts. This enables users to mix these individual conditions with greater flexibility, leading to more efficient and accurate image generation control. Previous ControlNet-based models rely solely on global conditions, which affect the entire image and lack the ability of element- or region-specific control. This limitation reduces flexibility and can cause condition misunderstandings in multi-conditional image generation. To address these challenges, we propose both intra-element and Inter-element Controllers in DC-ControlNet. The Intra-Element Controller handles different types of control signals within individual elements, accurately describing the content and layout characteristics of the object. For interactions between elements, we introduce the Inter-Element Controller, which accurately handles multi-element interactions and occlusion based on user-defined relationships. Extensive evaluations show that DC-ControlNet significantly outperforms existing ControlNet models and Layout-to-Image generative models in terms of control flexibility and precision in multi-condition control.

- **Summary**: Efficient and privacy-preserving multimodal interaction is essential as AR, VR, and modern smartphones with powerful cameras become primary interfaces for human-computer communication. Existing powerful large vision-language models (VLMs) enabling multimodal interaction often rely on cloud-based processing, raising significant concerns about (1) visual privacy by transmitting sensitive vision data to servers, and (2) their limited real-time, on-device usability. This paper explores Visual Instruction Rewriting, a novel approach that transforms multimodal instructions into text-only commands, allowing seamless integration of lightweight on-device instruction rewriter VLMs (250M parameters) with existing conversational AI systems, enhancing vision data privacy. To achieve this, we present a dataset of over 39,000 examples across 14 domains and develop a compact VLM, pretrained on image captioning datasets and fine-tuned for instruction rewriting. Experimental results, evaluated through NLG metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, along with semantic parsing analysis, demonstrate that even a quantized version of the model (<500MB storage footprint) can achieve effective instruction rewriting, thus enabling privacy-focused, multimodal AI applications.

- **Summary**: We introduce SigLIP 2, a family of new multilingual vision-language encoders that build on the success of the original SigLIP. In this second iteration, we extend the original image-text training objective with several prior, independently developed techniques into a unified recipe -- this includes captioning-based pretraining, self-supervised losses (self-distillation, masked prediction) and online data curation. With these changes, SigLIP 2 models outperform their SigLIP counterparts at all model scales in core capabilities, including zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and transfer performance when extracting visual representations for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Furthermore, the new training recipe leads to significant improvements on localization and dense prediction tasks. We also train variants which support multiple resolutions and preserve the input's native aspect ratio. Finally, we train on a more diverse data-mixture that includes de-biasing techniques, leading to much better multilingual understanding and improved fairness. To allow users to trade off inference cost with performance, we release model checkpoints at four sizes: ViT-B (86M), L (303M), So400m (400M), and g (1B).

- **Summary**: Recent work has demonstrated the ability to leverage or distill pre-trained 2D features obtained using large pre-trained 2D models into 3D features, enabling impressive 3D editing and understanding capabilities using only 2D supervision. Although impressive, models assume that 3D features are captured using a single feature field and often make a simplifying assumption that features are view-independent. In this work, we propose instead to capture 3D features using multiple disentangled feature fields that capture different structural components of 3D features involving view-dependent and view-independent components, which can be learned from 2D feature supervision only. Subsequently, each element can be controlled in isolation, enabling semantic and structural understanding and editing capabilities. For instance, using a user click, one can segment 3D features corresponding to a given object and then segment, edit, or remove their view-dependent (reflective) properties. We evaluate our approach on the task of 3D segmentation and demonstrate a set of novel understanding and editing tasks.

- **Summary**: Bird's Eye View (BEV) semantic maps have recently garnered a lot of attention as a useful representation of the environment to tackle assisted and autonomous driving tasks. However, most of the existing work focuses on the fully supervised setting, training networks on large annotated datasets. In this work, we present RendBEV, a new method for the self-supervised training of BEV semantic segmentation networks, leveraging differentiable volumetric rendering to receive supervision from semantic perspective views computed by a 2D semantic segmentation model. Our method enables zero-shot BEV semantic segmentation, and already delivers competitive results in this challenging setting. When used as pretraining to then fine-tune on labeled BEV ground-truth, our method significantly boosts performance in low-annotation regimes, and sets a new state of the art when fine-tuning on all available labels.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the limitations of current humanoid robot control frameworks, which primarily rely on reactive mechanisms and lack autonomous interaction capabilities due to data scarcity. We propose Humanoid-VLA, a novel framework that integrates language understanding, egocentric scene perception, and motion control, enabling universal humanoid control. Humanoid-VLA begins with language-motion pre-alignment using non-egocentric human motion datasets paired with textual descriptions, allowing the model to learn universal motion patterns and action semantics. We then incorporate egocentric visual context through a parameter efficient video-conditioned fine-tuning, enabling context-aware motion generation. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised data augmentation strategy that automatically generates pseudoannotations directly derived from motion data. This process converts raw motion sequences into informative question-answer pairs, facilitating the effective use of large-scale unlabeled video data. Built upon whole-body control architectures, extensive experiments show that Humanoid-VLA achieves object interaction and environment exploration tasks with enhanced contextual awareness, demonstrating a more human-like capacity for adaptive and intelligent engagement.

- **Summary**: Traffic accidents present complex challenges for autonomous driving, often featuring unpredictable scenarios that hinder accurate system interpretation and responses. Nonetheless, prevailing methodologies fall short in elucidating the causes of accidents and proposing preventive measures due to the paucity of training data specific to accident scenarios. In this work, we introduce AVD2 (Accident Video Diffusion for Accident Video Description), a novel framework that enhances accident scene understanding by generating accident videos that aligned with detailed natural language descriptions and reasoning, resulting in the contributed EMM-AU (Enhanced Multi-Modal Accident Video Understanding) dataset. Empirical results reveal that the integration of the EMM-AU dataset establishes state-of-the-art performance across both automated metrics and human evaluations, markedly advancing the domains of accident analysis and prevention.

- **Summary**: Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.

- **Summary**: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has emerged as a pivotal task in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, requiring models to understand and reason about visual content in response to natural language questions. Analyzing VQA datasets is essential for developing robust models that can handle the complexities of multimodal reasoning. Several approaches have been developed to examine these datasets, each offering distinct perspectives on question diversity, answer distribution, and visual-textual correlations. Despite significant progress, existing VQA models face challenges related to dataset bias, limited model complexity, commonsense reasoning gaps, rigid evaluation methods, and generalization to real world scenarios. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of five advanced VQA models: ABC-CNN, KICNLE, Masked Vision and Language Modeling, BLIP-2, and OFA, each employing distinct methodologies to address these challenges.

- **Summary**: Latent diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for generating high-quality images and videos, utilizing compressed latent representations to reduce the computational burden of the diffusion process. While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K 256x256 and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 17x256x256.

- **Summary**: Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can process inputs with context lengths up to 128k visual and text tokens, yet they struggle to generate coherent outputs beyond 1,000 words. We find that the primary limitation is the absence of long output examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). To tackle this issue, we introduce LongWriter-V-22k, a SFT dataset comprising 22,158 examples, each with multiple input images, an instruction, and corresponding outputs ranging from 0 to 10,000 words. Moreover, to achieve long outputs that maintain high-fidelity to the input images, we employ Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the SFT model. Given the high cost of collecting human feedback for lengthy outputs (e.g., 3,000 words), we propose IterDPO, which breaks long outputs into segments and uses iterative corrections to form preference pairs with the original outputs. Additionally, we develop MMLongBench-Write, a benchmark featuring six tasks to evaluate the long-generation capabilities of VLMs. Our 7B parameter model, trained with LongWriter-V-22k and IterDPO, achieves impressive performance on this benchmark, outperforming larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.

- **Summary**: Personalizing generative text-to-image models has seen remarkable progress, but extending this personalization to text-to-video models presents unique challenges. Unlike static concepts, personalizing text-to-video models has the potential to capture dynamic concepts, i.e., entities defined not only by their appearance but also by their motion. In this paper, we introduce Set-and-Sequence, a novel framework for personalizing Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)-based generative video models with dynamic concepts. Our approach imposes a spatio-temporal weight space within an architecture that does not explicitly separate spatial and temporal features. This is achieved in two key stages. First, we fine-tune Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers using an unordered set of frames from the video to learn an identity LoRA basis that represents the appearance, free from temporal interference. In the second stage, with the identity LoRAs frozen, we augment their coefficients with Motion Residuals and fine-tune them on the full video sequence, capturing motion dynamics. Our Set-and-Sequence framework results in a spatio-temporal weight space that effectively embeds dynamic concepts into the video model's output domain, enabling unprecedented editability and compositionality while setting a new benchmark for personalizing dynamic concepts.

- **Summary**: Reasoning about images with rich text, such as charts and documents, is a critical application of vision-language models (VLMs). However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data. To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data. Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., "nutrition fact labels"), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images. With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM. Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art performance among competitive open-source models, including Llama 3.2, and surpass proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Furthermore, CoSyn can produce synthetic pointing data, enabling VLMs to ground information within input images, showcasing its potential for developing multimodal agents capable of acting in real-world environments.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enhances reasoning capabilities by integrating external knowledge. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on simple image-text interactions, overlooking complex visual formats like charts that are prevalent in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a novel task, Chart-based MRAG, to address this limitation. To semi-automatically generate high-quality evaluation samples, we propose CHARt-based document question-answering GEneration (CHARGE), a framework that produces evaluation data through structured keypoint extraction, crossmodal verification, and keypoint-based generation. By combining CHARGE with expert validation, we construct Chart-MRAG Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for chart-based MRAG evaluation, featuring 4,738 question-answering pairs across 8 domains from real-world documents. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations in current approaches: (1) unified multimodal embedding retrieval methods struggles in chart-based scenarios, (2) even with ground-truth retrieval, state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve only 58.19% Correctness and 73.87% Coverage scores, and (3) MLLMs demonstrate consistent text-over-visual modality bias during Chart-based MRAG reasoning. The CHARGE and Chart-MRAG Bench are released at https://github.com/Nomothings/CHARGE.git.
