- **Summary**: Continual adaptation of vision-language models (VLMs) focuses on leveraging cross-modal pretrained knowledge to incrementally adapt for expanding downstream tasks and datasets, while tackling the challenge of knowledge forgetting. Existing research often focuses on connecting visual features with specific class text in downstream tasks, overlooking the latent relationships between general and specialized knowledge. Our findings reveal that forcing models to optimize inappropriate visual-text matches exacerbates forgetting of VLMs. To tackle this issue, we propose DesCLIP, which leverages general attribute (GA) descriptions to guide the understanding of specific class objects, enabling VLMs to establish robust \textit{vision-GA-class} trilateral associations rather than relying solely on \textit{vision-class} connections. Specifically, we introduce a language assistant to generate concrete GA description candidates via proper request prompts. Then, an anchor-based embedding filter is designed to obtain highly relevant GA description embeddings, which are leveraged as the paired text embeddings for visual-textual instance matching, thereby tuning the visual encoder. Correspondingly, the class text embeddings are gradually calibrated to align with these shared GA description embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancements and efficacy of our proposed method, with comprehensive empirical evaluations highlighting its superior performance compared to existing pretrained and VLM-based continual learning methods.

- **Summary**: Ensuring fairness in medical image segmentation is critical due to biases in imbalanced clinical data acquisition caused by demographic attributes (e.g., age, sex, race) and clinical factors (e.g., disease severity). To address these challenges, we introduce Distribution-aware Mixture of Experts (dMoE), inspired by optimal control theory. We provide a comprehensive analysis of its underlying mechanisms and clarify dMoE's role in adapting to heterogeneous distributions in medical image segmentation. Furthermore, we integrate dMoE into multiple network architectures, demonstrating its broad applicability across diverse medical image analysis tasks. By incorporating demographic and clinical factors, dMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 2D benchmark datasets and a 3D in-house dataset. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dMoE in mitigating biases from imbalanced distributions, offering a promising approach to bridging control theory and medical image segmentation within fairness learning paradigms. The source code will be made available.

- **Summary**: We present generative predictive control (GPC), a learning control framework that (i) clones a generative diffusion-based policy from expert demonstrations, (ii) trains a predictive action-conditioned world model from both expert demonstrations and random explorations, and (iii) synthesizes an online planner that ranks and optimizes the action proposals from (i) by looking ahead into the future using the world model from (ii). Crucially, we show that conditional video diffusion allows learning (near) physics-accurate visual world models and enable robust visual foresight. Focusing on planar pushing with rich contact and collision, we show GPC dominates behavior cloning across state-based and vision-based, simulated and real-world experiments.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance and brought a range of unexplored capabilities to natural image segmentation tasks. However, as a very important branch of image segmentation, the performance of SAM remains uncertain when applied to medical image segmentation due to the significant differences between natural images and medical images. Meanwhile, it is harsh to meet the SAM's requirements of extra prompts provided, such as points or boxes to specify medical regions. In this paper, we propose a novel self-prompt SAM adaptation framework for medical image segmentation, named Self-Prompt-SAM. We design a multi-scale prompt generator combined with the image encoder in SAM to generate auxiliary masks. Then, we use the auxiliary masks to generate bounding boxes as box prompts and use Distance Transform to select the most central points as point prompts. Meanwhile, we design a 3D depth-fused adapter (DfusedAdapter) and inject the DFusedAdapter into each transformer in the image encoder and mask decoder to enable pre-trained 2D SAM models to extract 3D information and adapt to 3D medical images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms nnUNet by 2.3% on AMOS2022, 1.6% on ACDCand 0.5% on Synapse datasets.

- **Summary**: Bone density prediction via CT scans to estimate T-scores is crucial, providing a more precise assessment of bone health compared to traditional methods like X-ray bone density tests, which lack spatial resolution and the ability to detect localized changes. However, CT-based prediction faces two major challenges: the high computational complexity of transformer-based architectures, which limits their deployment in portable and clinical settings, and the imbalanced, long-tailed distribution of real-world hospital data that skews predictions. To address these issues, we introduce MedConv, a convolutional model for bone density prediction that outperforms transformer models with lower computational demands. We also adapt Bal-CE loss and post-hoc logit adjustment to improve class balance. Extensive experiments on our AustinSpine dataset shows that our approach achieves up to 21% improvement in accuracy and 20% in ROC AUC over previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The probabilistic diffusion model (DM), generating content by inferencing through a recursive chain structure, has emerged as a powerful framework for visual generation. After pre-training on enormous unlabeled data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a zeroth-order informed fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The zeroth-order gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with the lower variance than other methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of the RLR. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation tasks to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian splatting-based talking head synthesis has recently gained attention for its ability to render high-fidelity images with real-time inference speed. However, since it is typically trained on only a short video that lacks the diversity in facial emotions, the resultant talking heads struggle to represent a wide range of emotions. To address this issue, we propose a lip-aligned emotional face generator and leverage it to train our EmoTalkingGaussian model. It is able to manipulate facial emotions conditioned on continuous emotion values (i.e., valence and arousal); while retaining synchronization of lip movements with input audio. Additionally, to achieve the accurate lip synchronization for in-the-wild audio, we introduce a self-supervised learning method that leverages a text-to-speech network and a visual-audio synchronization network. We experiment our EmoTalkingGaussian on publicly available videos and have obtained better results than state-of-the-arts in terms of image quality (measured in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), emotion expression (measured in V-RMSE, A-RMSE, V-SA, A-SA, Emotion Accuracy), and lip synchronization (measured in LMD, Sync-E, Sync-C), respectively.

- **Summary**: Existing vision-language model (VLM)-based methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection typically rely on similarity scores between input images and in-distribution (ID) text prototypes. However, the modality gap between image and text often results in high false positive rates, as OOD samples can exhibit high similarity to ID text prototypes. To mitigate the impact of this modality gap, we propose incorporating ID image prototypes along with ID text prototypes. We present theoretical analysis and empirical evidence indicating that this approach enhances VLM-based OOD detection performance without any additional training. To further reduce the gap between image and text, we introduce a novel few-shot tuning framework, SUPREME, comprising biased prompts generation (BPG) and image-text consistency (ITC) modules. BPG enhances image-text fusion and improves generalization by conditioning ID text prototypes on the Gaussian-based estimated image domain bias; ITC reduces the modality gap by minimizing intra- and inter-modal distances. Moreover, inspired by our theoretical and empirical findings, we introduce a novel OOD score $S_{\textit{GMP}}$, leveraging uni- and cross-modal similarities. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate that SUPREME consistently outperforms existing VLM-based OOD detection methods.

- **Summary**: Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision with diverse applications, ranging from autonomous systems to medical imaging. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark to evaluate the performance of classification models on small-scale, multi-class datasets. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art results; however, they often suffer from overfitting and suboptimal feature representation when applied to challenging datasets like CIFAR-10. In this paper, we propose an enhanced CNN architecture that integrates deeper convolutional blocks, batch normalization, and dropout regularization to achieve superior performance. The proposed model achieves a test accuracy of 84.95%, outperforming baseline CNN architectures. Through detailed ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhancements and analyze the hierarchical feature representations. This work highlights the potential of refined CNN architectures for tackling small-scale image classification problems effectively.

- **Summary**: Navigating the complexities of person re-identification (ReID) in varied surveillance scenarios, particularly when occlusions occur, poses significant challenges. We introduce an innovative Motion-Aware Fusion (MOTAR-FUSE) network that utilizes motion cues derived from static imagery to significantly enhance ReID capabilities. This network incorporates a dual-input visual adapter capable of processing both images and videos, thereby facilitating more effective feature extraction. A unique aspect of our approach is the integration of a motion consistency task, which empowers the motion-aware transformer to adeptly capture the dynamics of human motion. This technique substantially improves the recognition of features in scenarios where occlusions are prevalent, thereby advancing the ReID process. Our comprehensive evaluations across multiple ReID benchmarks, including holistic, occluded, and video-based scenarios, demonstrate that our MOTAR-FUSE network achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches.

- **Summary**: One-step shortcut diffusion models [Frans, Hafner, Levine and Abbeel, ICLR 2025] have shown potential in vision generation, but their reliance on first-order trajectory supervision is fundamentally limited. The Shortcut model's simplistic velocity-only approach fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry, leading to erratic trajectories, poor geometric alignment, and instability-especially in high-curvature regions. These shortcomings stem from its inability to model mid-horizon dependencies or complex distributional features, leaving it ill-equipped for robust generative modeling. In this work, we introduce HOMO (High-Order Matching for One-Step Shortcut Diffusion), a game-changing framework that leverages high-order supervision to revolutionize distribution transportation. By incorporating acceleration, jerk, and beyond, HOMO not only fixes the flaws of the Shortcut model but also achieves unprecedented smoothness, stability, and geometric precision. Theoretically, we prove that HOMO's high-order supervision ensures superior approximation accuracy, outperforming first-order methods. Empirically, HOMO dominates in complex settings, particularly in high-curvature regions where the Shortcut model struggles. Our experiments show that HOMO delivers smoother trajectories and better distributional alignment, setting a new standard for one-step generative models.

- **Summary**: Chronic liver disease represents a significant health challenge worldwide and accurate prognostic evaluations are essential for personalized treatment plans. Recent evidence suggests that integrating multimodal data, such as computed tomography imaging, radiomic features, and clinical information, can provide more comprehensive prognostic information. However, modalities have an inherent heterogeneity, and incorporating additional modalities may exacerbate the challenges of heterogeneous data fusion. Moreover, existing multimodal fusion methods often struggle to adapt to richer medical modalities, making it difficult to capture inter-modal relationships. To overcome these limitations, We present the Triple-Modal Interaction Chronic Liver Network (TMI-CLNet). Specifically, we develop an Intra-Modality Aggregation module and a Triple-Modal Cross-Attention Fusion module, which are designed to eliminate intra-modality redundancy and extract cross-modal information, respectively. Furthermore, we design a Triple-Modal Feature Fusion loss function to align feature representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the liver prognosis dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unimodal models and other multi-modal techniques.

- **Summary**: IQ testing has served as a foundational methodology for evaluating human cognitive capabilities, deliberately decoupling assessment from linguistic background, language proficiency, or domain-specific knowledge to isolate core competencies in abstraction and reasoning. Yet, artificial intelligence research currently lacks systematic benchmarks to quantify these critical cognitive dimensions in multimodal systems. To address this critical gap, we propose MM-IQ, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 2,710 meticulously curated test items spanning 8 distinct reasoning paradigms.   Through systematic evaluation of leading open-source and proprietary multimodal models, our benchmark reveals striking limitations: even state-of-the-art architectures achieve only marginally superior performance to random chance (27.49% vs. 25% baseline accuracy). This substantial performance chasm highlights the inadequacy of current multimodal systems in approximating fundamental human reasoning capacities, underscoring the need for paradigm-shifting advancements to bridge this cognitive divide.

- **Summary**: Transformers have achieved significant success in learned image compression (LIC), with Swin Transformers emerging as the mainstream choice for nonlinear transforms. A common belief is that their sophisticated spatial operations contribute most to their efficacy. However, the crucial role of the feed-forward network (FFN) based Channel Aggregation module within the transformer architecture has been largely overlooked, and the over-design of spatial operations leads to a suboptimal trade-off between decoding latency and R-D performance. In this paper, we reevaluate the key factors behind the competence of transformers in LIC. By replacing spatial operations with identity mapping, we are surprised to find that channel operations alone can approach the R-D performance of the leading methods. This solid lower bound of performance emphasizes that the presence of channel aggregation is more essential for the LIC model to achieve competitive performance, while the previously complex spatial interactions are partly redundant. Based on this insight, we initiate the "S2CFormer" paradigm, a general architecture that reorients the focus of LIC from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation. We present two instantiations of the S2CFormer: S2C-Conv, and S2C-Attention. Each one incorporates a simple operator for spatial interaction and serves as nonlinear transform blocks for our LIC models. Both models demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) R-D performance and significantly faster decoding speed. These results also motivate further exploration of advanced FFN structures to enhance the R-D performance while maintaining model efficiency. With these foundations, we introduce S2C-Hybrid, an enhanced LIC model that combines the strengths of different S2CFormer instantiations. This model outperforms all the existing methods on several datasets, setting a new benchmark for efficient and high-performance LIC.

- **Summary**: Text-to-3D asset generation has achieved significant optimization under the supervision of 2D diffusion priors. However, when dealing with compositional scenes, existing methods encounter several challenges: 1). failure to ensure that composite scene layouts comply with physical laws; 2). difficulty in accurately capturing the assets and relationships described in complex scene descriptions; 3). limited autonomous asset generation capabilities among layout approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs). To avoid these compromises, we propose a novel framework for compositional scene generation, PhiP-G, which seamlessly integrates generation techniques with layout guidance based on a world model. Leveraging LLM-based agents, PhiP-G analyzes the complex scene description to generate a scene graph, and integrating a multimodal 2D generation agent and a 3D Gaussian generation method for targeted assets creation. For the stage of layout, PhiP-G employs a physical pool with adhesion capabilities and a visual supervision agent, forming a world model for layout prediction and planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhiP-G significantly enhances the generation quality and physical rationality of the compositional scenes. Notably, PhiP-G attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in CLIP scores, achieves parity with the leading methods in generation quality as measured by the T$^3$Bench, and improves efficiency by 24x.

- **Summary**: Visual reasoning refers to the task of solving questions about visual information. Current visual reasoning methods typically employ pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) strategies or deep neural network approaches. However, existing efforts are constrained by limited reasoning interpretability, while hindering by the phenomenon of underspecification in the question text. Additionally, the absence of fine-grained visual knowledge limits the precise understanding of subject behavior in visual reasoning tasks. To address these issues, we propose VIKSER (Visual Knowledge-Driven Self-Reinforcing Reasoning Framework). Specifically, VIKSER, trained using knowledge distilled from large language models, extracts fine-grained visual knowledge with the assistance of visual relationship detection techniques. Subsequently, VIKSER utilizes fine-grained visual knowledge to paraphrase the question with underspecification. Additionally, we design a novel prompting method called Chain-of-Evidence (CoE), which leverages the power of ``evidence for reasoning'' to endow VIKSER with interpretable reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of self-reflection technology empowers VIKSER with the ability to learn and improve from its mistakes. Experiments conducted on widely used datasets demonstrate that VIKSER achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in relevant tasks.

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer is a major cause of cancer-related deaths in men, where early detection greatly improves survival rates. Although MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy offers superior accuracy by combining MRI's detailed visualization with TRUS's real-time guidance, it is a complex and time-intensive procedure that relies heavily on manual annotations, leading to potential errors. To address these challenges, we propose a fully automatic MRI-TRUS fusion-based segmentation method that identifies prostate tumors directly in TRUS images without requiring manual annotations. Unlike traditional multimodal fusion approaches that rely on naive data concatenation, our method integrates a registration-segmentation framework to align and leverage spatial information between MRI and TRUS modalities. This alignment enhances segmentation accuracy and reduces reliance on manual effort. Our approach was validated on a dataset of 1,747 patients from Stanford Hospital, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 0.212, outperforming TRUS-only (0.117) and naive MRI-TRUS fusion (0.132) methods, with significant improvements (p $<$ 0.01). This framework demonstrates the potential for reducing the complexity of prostate cancer diagnosis and provides a flexible architecture applicable to other multimodal medical imaging tasks.

- **Summary**: Hallucination has been a long-standing and inevitable problem that hinders the application of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in domains that require high reliability. Various methods focus on improvement depending on data annotations or training strategies, yet place less emphasis on LLM's inherent problems. To fill this gap, we delve into the attention mechanism of the decoding process in the LVLM. Intriguingly, our investigation uncovers the prevalent attention redundancy within the hierarchical architecture of the LVLM, manifesting as overextended image processing in deep layers and an overabundance of non-essential image tokens. Stemming from the observation, we thus propose MINT, a novel training-free decoding strategy, MItigating hallucinations via tokeN reducTion. Specifically, we dynamically intensify the LVLM's local perception capability by masking its attention to irrelevant image tokens. In addition, we use contrastive decoding that pushes the model to focus more on those key image regions. Our full method aims to guide the model in concentrating more on key visual elements during generation. Extensive experimental results on several popular public benchmarks show that our approach achieves a 4% improvement in mitigating hallucinations caused by distracted perception compared to original models. Meanwhile, our approach is demonstrated to make the model perceive 5% more visual points even though we reduce a suite of image tokens.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a large-scale segmentation model that enables powerful zero-shot capabilities with flexible prompts. While SAM can segment any object in zero-shot, it requires user-provided prompts for each target image and does not attach any label information to masks. Few-shot segmentation models addressed these issues by inputting annotated reference images as prompts to SAM and can segment specific objects in target images without user-provided prompts. Previous SAM-based few-shot segmentation models only use annotated reference images as prompts, resulting in limited accuracy due to a lack of reference information. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot segmentation model, Vision and Language reference Prompt into SAM (VLP-SAM), that utilizes the visual information of the reference images and the semantic information of the text labels by inputting not only images but also language as reference information. In particular, VLP-SAM is a simple and scalable structure with minimal learnable parameters, which inputs prompt embeddings with vision-language information into SAM using a multimodal vision-language model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VLP-SAM, we conducted experiments on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets, and achieved high performance in the few-shot segmentation task, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model by a large margin (6.3% and 9.5% in mIoU, respectively). Furthermore, VLP-SAM demonstrates its generality in unseen objects that are not included in the training data. Our code is available at https://github.com/kosukesakurai1/VLP-SAM.

- **Summary**: As a type of multi-dimensional sequential data, the spatial and temporal dependencies of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals should be further investigated. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal progressive attention model (STPAM) to improve EEG classification in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks. STPAM first adopts three distinct spatial experts to learn the spatial topological information of brain regions progressively, which is used to minimize the interference of irrelevant brain regions. Concretely, the former expert filters out EEG electrodes in the relative brain regions to be used as prior knowledge for the next expert, ensuring that the subsequent experts gradually focus their attention on information from significant EEG electrodes. This process strengthens the effect of the important brain regions. Then, based on the above-obtained feature sequence with spatial information, three temporal experts are adopted to capture the temporal dependence by progressively assigning attention to the crucial EEG slices. Except for the above EEG classification method, in this paper, we build a novel Infrared RSVP EEG Dataset (IRED) which is based on dim infrared images with small targets for the first time, and conduct extensive experiments on it. The results show that our STPAM can achieve better performance than all the compared methods.

- **Summary**: Existing methods for analyzing linguistic content from picture descriptions for assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment often overlook the participant's visual narrative path, which typically requires eye tracking to assess. Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers. Statistical analyses reveal that the features derived by the automated method produce comparable results to the manual method, with even greater group differences between clinical groups of interest. These results highlight the potential of the automated approach for extracting spatio-semantic features in developing clinical speech models for cognitive impairment assessment.

- **Summary**: Early Exit (EE) techniques have emerged as a means to reduce inference latency in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The latency improvement and accuracy in these techniques crucially depend on the criteria used to make exit decisions. We propose a new decision criterion where exit classifiers are treated as experts BEEM and aggregate their confidence scores. The confidence scores are aggregated only if neighbouring experts are consistent in prediction as the samples pass through them, thus capturing their ensemble effect. A sample exits when the aggregated confidence value exceeds a threshold. The threshold is set using the error rates of the intermediate exits aiming to surpass the performance of conventional DNN inference. Experimental results on the COCO dataset for Image captioning and GLUE datasets for various language tasks demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of state-of-the-art EE methods, achieving improvements in speed-up by a factor 1.5x to 2.1x. When compared to the final layer, its accuracy is comparable in harder Image Captioning and improves in the easier language tasks.

- **Summary**: Table tennis robots gained traction over the last years and have become a popular research challenge for control and perception algorithms. Fast and accurate ball detection is crucial for enabling a robotic arm to rally the ball back successfully. So far, most table tennis robots use conventional, frame-based cameras for the perception pipeline. However, frame-based cameras suffer from motion blur if the frame rate is not high enough for fast-moving objects. Event-based cameras, on the other hand, do not have this drawback since pixels report changes in intensity asynchronously and independently, leading to an event stream with a temporal resolution on the order of us. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first real-time perception pipeline for a table tennis robot that uses only event-based cameras. We show that compared to a frame-based pipeline, event-based perception pipelines have an update rate which is an order of magnitude higher. This is beneficial for the estimation and prediction of the ball's position, velocity, and spin, resulting in lower mean errors and uncertainties. These improvements are an advantage for the robot control, which has to be fast, given the short time a table tennis ball is flying until the robot has to hit back.

- **Summary**: Continuous dynamical systems are cornerstones of many scientific and engineering disciplines. While machine learning offers powerful tools to model these systems from trajectory data, challenges arise when these trajectories are captured as images, resulting in pixel-level observations that are discrete in nature. Consequently, a naive application of a convolutional autoencoder can result in latent coordinates that are discontinuous in time. To resolve this, we propose continuity-preserving convolutional autoencoders (CpAEs) to learn continuous latent states and their corresponding continuous latent dynamical models from discrete image frames. We present a mathematical formulation for learning dynamics from image frames, which illustrates issues with previous approaches and motivates our methodology based on promoting the continuity of convolution filters, thereby preserving the continuity of the latent states. This approach enables CpAEs to produce latent states that evolve continuously with the underlying dynamics, leading to more accurate latent dynamical models. Extensive experiments across various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of CpAEs.

- **Summary**: Vision classifiers are often trained on proprietary datasets containing sensitive information, yet the models themselves are frequently shared openly under the privacy-preserving assumption. Although these models are assumed to protect sensitive information in their training data, the extent to which this assumption holds for different architectures remains unexplored. This assumption is challenged by inversion attacks which attempt to reconstruct training data from model weights, exposing significant privacy vulnerabilities. In this study, we systematically evaluate the privacy-preserving properties of vision classifiers across diverse architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Using network inversion-based reconstruction techniques, we assess the extent to which these architectures memorize and reveal training data, quantifying the relative ease of reconstruction across models. Our analysis highlights how architectural differences, such as input representation, feature extraction mechanisms, and weight structures, influence privacy risks. By comparing these architectures, we identify which are more resilient to inversion attacks and examine the trade-offs between model performance and privacy preservation, contributing to the development of secure and privacy-respecting machine learning models for sensitive applications. Our findings provide actionable insights into the design of secure and privacy-aware machine learning systems, emphasizing the importance of evaluating architectural decisions in sensitive applications involving proprietary or personal data.

- **Summary**: Forest is the most significant land-based carbon storage mechanism. The forest carbon sink can effectively decrease the atmospheric CO2 concentration and mitigate climate change. Remote sensing estimation not only ensures high accuracy of data, but also enables large-scale area observation. Optical images provide the possibility for long-term monitoring, which is a potential issue in the future carbon storage estimation research. We chose Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China as the study area, took GF-1 WFV satellite image as the data, introduced the KD-VGG module to extract the initial features, and proposed the improved implicit diffusion model (IIDM). The results showed that: (1) The VGG-19 module after knowledge distillation can realize the initial feature extraction, reduce the inference time and improve the accuracy in the case of reducing the number of model parameters. (2) The Attention + MLP module was added for feature fusion to obtain the relationship between global and local features and realized the restoration of high-fidelity images in the continuous scale range. (3) The IIDM model proposed in this paper had the highest estimation accuracy, with RMSE of 28.68, which was 13.16 higher than that of the regression model, about 31.45%. In the estimation of carbon storage, the generative model can extract deeper features, and its performance was significantly better than other models. It demonstrated the feasibility of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) in the field of quantitative remote sensing and provided valuable insights for the study of carbon neutralization effect. By combining the actual characteristics of the forest, the regional carbon storage estimation with a resolution of 16-meter was utilized to provide a significant theoretical basis for the formulation of forest carbon sink regulation.

- **Summary**: Forests function as crucial carbon reservoirs on land, and their carbon sinks can efficiently reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigate climate change. Currently, the overall trend for monitoring and assessing forest carbon stocks is to integrate ground monitoring sample data with satellite remote sensing imagery. This style of analysis facilitates large-scale observation. However, these techniques require improvement in accuracy. We used GF-1 WFV and Landsat TM images to analyze Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province in China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon stock estimation into an image translation.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, excelling in handling longer sequences. However, the inefficiency and redundancy in processing extended in-context tokens remain a challenge. Many attempts to address this rely on compressing tokens with smaller text encoders, yet we question whether text encoders are truly indispensable. Our journey leads to an unexpected discovery-a much smaller vision encoder, applied directly to sequences of text tokens, can rival text encoders on text tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small text understanding benchmarks, VIST leads to comparable results with 16% fewer FLOPs and 50% less memory usage. We further uncover significant token redundancy and devise a frequency-based masking strategy to guide the focus of the visual encoder toward the most critical tokens. Interestingly, we observe the trained visual encoder performs like a summarizer, selectively ignoring less important words such as prepositions and conjunctions. This approach delivers remarkable results, outperforming traditional text encoder-based methods by 5.7% on average over benchmarks like TriviaQA, NQ, PopQA, TREF, SST2, and SST5, setting a new standard for token efficiency in LLMs.

- **Summary**: The emergence of foundational models has greatly improved performance across various downstream tasks, with fine-tuning often yielding even better results. However, existing fine-tuning approaches typically require access to model weights and layers, leading to challenges such as managing multiple model copies or inference pipelines, inefficiencies in edge device optimization, and concerns over proprietary rights, privacy, and exposure to unsafe model variants. In this paper, we address these challenges by exploring "Gray-box" fine-tuning approaches, where the model's architecture and weights remain hidden, allowing only gradient propagation. We introduce a novel yet simple and effective framework that adapts to new tasks using two lightweight learnable modules at the model's input and output. Additionally, we present a less restrictive variant that offers more entry points into the model, balancing performance with model exposure. We evaluate our approaches across several backbones on benchmarks such as text-image alignment, text-video alignment, and sketch-image alignment. Results show that our Gray-box approaches are competitive with full-access fine-tuning methods, despite having limited access to the model.

- **Summary**: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made remarkable achievements in synthesizing images in recent years. Typically, training GANs requires massive data, and the performance of GANs deteriorates significantly when training data is limited. To improve the synthesis performance of GANs in low-data regimes, existing approaches use various data augmentation techniques to enlarge the training sets. However, it is identified that these augmentation techniques may leak or even alter the data distribution. To remedy this, we propose an adversarial semantic augmentation (ASA) technique to enlarge the training data at the semantic level instead of the image level. Concretely, considering semantic features usually encode informative information of images, we estimate the covariance matrices of semantic features for both real and generated images to find meaningful transformation directions. Such directions translate original features to another semantic representation, e.g., changing the backgrounds or expressions of the human face dataset. Moreover, we derive an upper bound of the expected adversarial loss. By optimizing the upper bound, our semantic augmentation is implicitly achieved. Such design avoids redundant sampling of the augmented features and introduces negligible computation overhead, making our approach computation efficient. Extensive experiments on both few-shot and large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method consistently improve the synthesis quality under various data regimes, and further visualized and analytic results suggesting satisfactory versatility of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration (LCEC) is the core for data fusion in computer vision. Existing methods typically rely on customized calibration targets or fixed scene types, lacking the flexibility to handle variations in sensor data and environmental contexts. This paper introduces EdO-LCEC, the first environment-driven, online calibration approach that achieves human-like adaptability. Inspired by the human perceptual system, EdO-LCEC incorporates a generalizable scene discriminator to actively interpret environmental conditions, creating multiple virtual cameras that capture detailed spatial and textural information. To overcome cross-modal feature matching challenges between LiDAR and camera, we propose dual-path correspondence matching (DPCM), which leverages both structural and textural consistency to achieve reliable 3D-2D correspondences. Our approach formulates the calibration process as a spatial-temporal joint optimization problem, utilizing global constraints from multiple views and scenes to improve accuracy, particularly in sparse or partially overlapping sensor views. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that EdO-LCEC achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing reliable and precise calibration across diverse, challenging environments.

- **Summary**: Likelihood-based deep generative models (DGMs) have gained significant attention for their ability to approximate the distributions of high-dimensional data. However, these models lack a performance guarantee in assigning higher likelihood values to in-distribution (ID) inputs, data the models are trained on, compared to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This counter-intuitive behaviour is particularly pronounced when ID inputs are more complex than OOD data points. One potential approach to address this challenge involves leveraging the gradient of a data point with respect to the parameters of the DGMs. A recent OOD detection framework proposed estimating the joint density of layer-wise gradient norms for a given data point as a model-agnostic method, demonstrating superior performance compared to the Typicality Test across likelihood-based DGMs and image dataset pairs. In particular, most existing methods presuppose access to fully converged models, the training of which is both time-intensive and computationally demanding. In this work, we demonstrate that using immature models,stopped at early stages of training, can mostly achieve equivalent or even superior results on this downstream task compared to mature models capable of generating high-quality samples that closely resemble ID data. This novel finding enhances our understanding of how DGMs learn the distribution of ID data and highlights the potential of leveraging partially trained models for downstream tasks. Furthermore, we offer a possible explanation for this unexpected behaviour through the concept of support overlap.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for solving the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task in autonomous driving by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with continual learning. In autonomous driving, VQA plays a vital role in enabling the system to understand and reason about its surroundings. However, traditional models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when sequentially exposed to new driving tasks, such as perception, prediction, and planning, each requiring different forms of knowledge. To address this challenge, we present a novel continual learning framework that combines VLMs with selective memory replay and knowledge distillation, reinforced by task-specific projection layer regularization. The knowledge distillation allows a previously trained model to act as a "teacher" to guide the model through subsequent tasks, minimizing forgetting. Meanwhile, task-specific projection layers calculate the loss based on the divergence of feature representations, ensuring continuity in learning and reducing the shift between tasks. Evaluated on the DriveLM dataset, our framework shows substantial performance improvements, with gains ranging from 21.40% to 32.28% across various metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining continual learning with VLMs in enhancing the resilience and reliability of VQA systems in autonomous driving. We will release our source code.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion V3 and Flux, have achieved notable progress. However, these models are strongly restricted to their limited knowledge, a.k.a., their own fixed parameters, that are trained with closed datasets. This leads to significant hallucinations or distortions when facing fine-grained and unseen novel real-world objects, e.g., the appearance of the Tesla Cybertruck. To this end, we present the first real-object-based retrieval-augmented generation framework (RealRAG), which augments fine-grained and unseen novel object generation by learning and retrieving real-world images to overcome the knowledge gaps of generative models. Specifically, to integrate missing memory for unseen novel object generation, we train a reflective retriever by self-reflective contrastive learning, which injects the generator's knowledge into the sef-reflective negatives, ensuring that the retrieved augmented images compensate for the model's missing knowledge. Furthermore, the real-object-based framework integrates fine-grained visual knowledge for the generative models, tackling the distortion problem and improving the realism for fine-grained object generation. Our Real-RAG is superior in its modular application to all types of state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models and also delivers remarkable performance boosts with all of them, such as a gain of 16.18% FID score with the auto-regressive model on the Stanford Car benchmark.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of AIGC technology, significant progress has been made in diffusion model-based technologies for text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V). In recent years, a few studies have introduced the strategy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) into T2I tasks, significantly enhancing human preferences in generated images. However, existing T2V generation methods lack a well-formed pipeline with exact loss function to guide the alignment of generated videos with human preferences using DPO strategies. Additionally, challenges such as the scarcity of paired video preference data hinder effective model training. At the same time, the lack of training datasets poses a risk of insufficient flexibility and poor video generation quality in the generated videos. Based on those problems, our work proposes three targeted solutions in sequence. 1) Our work is the first to introduce the DPO strategy into the T2V tasks. By deriving a carefully structured loss function, we utilize human feedback to align video generation with human preferences. We refer to this new method as HuViDPO. 2) Our work constructs small-scale human preference datasets for each action category and fine-tune this model, improving the aesthetic quality of the generated videos while reducing training costs. 3) We adopt a First-Frame-Conditioned strategy, leveraging the rich in formation from the first frame to guide the generation of subsequent frames, enhancing flexibility in video generation. At the same time, we employ a SparseCausal Attention mechanism to enhance the quality of the generated videos.More details and examples can be accessed on our website: https://tankowa.github.io/HuViDPO. github.io/.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling continuous signals. The spectral bias of ReLU-based networks is a well-established limitation, restricting their ability to capture fine-grained details in target signals. While previous works have attempted to mitigate this issue through frequency-based encodings or architectural modifications, these approaches often introduce additional complexity and do not fully address the underlying challenge of learning high-frequency components efficiently. We introduce Sinusoidal Trainable Activation Functions (STAF), designed to directly tackle this limitation by enabling networks to adaptively learn and represent complex signals with higher precision and efficiency. STAF inherently modulates its frequency components, allowing for self-adaptive spectral learning. This capability significantly improves convergence speed and expressivity, making STAF highly effective for both signal representations and inverse problems. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that STAF outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in accuracy and reconstruction fidelity with superior Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). These results establish STAF as a robust solution for overcoming spectral bias and the capacity-convergence gap, making it valuable for computer graphics and related fields.

- **Summary**: The rapid growth of submissions to top-tier Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) conferences has prompted many venues to transition from closed to open review platforms. Some have fully embraced open peer reviews, allowing public visibility throughout the process, while others adopt hybrid approaches, such as releasing reviews only after final decisions or keeping reviews private despite using open peer review systems. In this work, we analyze the strengths and limitations of these models, highlighting the growing community interest in transparent peer review. To support this discussion, we examine insights from Paper Copilot, a website launched two years ago to aggregate and analyze AI / ML conference data while engaging a global audience. The site has attracted over 200,000 early-career researchers, particularly those aged 18-34 from 177 countries, many of whom are actively engaged in the peer review process. Drawing on our findings, this position paper advocates for a more transparent, open, and well-regulated peer review aiming to foster greater community involvement and propel advancements in the field.

- **Summary**: Visual prompting has gained popularity as a method for adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks, particularly in the realm of parameter-efficient tuning. However, existing visual prompting techniques often pad the prompt parameters around the image, limiting the interaction between the visual prompts and the original image to a small set of patches while neglecting the inductive bias present in shared information across different patches. In this study, we conduct a thorough preliminary investigation to identify and address these limitations. We propose a novel visual prompt design, introducing Low-Rank matrix multiplication for Visual Prompting (LoR-VP), which enables shared and patch-specific information across rows and columns of image pixels. Extensive experiments across seven network architectures and four datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art visual prompting methods, achieving up to 6 times faster training times, utilizing 18 times fewer visual prompt parameters, and delivering a 3.1% improvement in performance.

- **Summary**: Vision-language navigation in unknown environments is crucial for mobile robots. In scenarios such as household assistance and rescue, mobile robots need to understand a human command, such as "find a person wearing black". We present a novel vision-language navigation (VL-Nav) system that integrates efficient spatial reasoning on low-power robots. Unlike prior methods that rely on a single image-level feature similarity to guide a robot, we introduce the heuristic-vision-language (HVL) spatial reasoning for goal point selection. It combines pixel-wise vision-language features and heuristic exploration to enable efficient navigation to human-instructed instances in various environments robustly. We deploy VL-Nav on a four-wheel mobile robot and conduct comprehensive navigation tasks in various environments of different scales and semantic complexities, indoors and outdoors. Remarkably, VL-Nav operates at a real-time frequency of 30 Hz with a Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its ability to conduct efficient vision-language navigation. Experimental results show that VL-Nav achieves an overall success rate of 86.3%, outperforming previous methods by 44.15%.

- **Summary**: This study develops a transfer learning model for the automated classification of two species of fruit flies, Anastrepha fraterculus and Ceratitis capitata, in a controlled laboratory environment. The research addresses the need to optimize identification and classification, which are currently performed manually by experts, being affected by human factors and facing time challenges. The methodological process of this study includes the capture of high-quality images using a mobile phone camera and a stereo microscope, followed by segmentation to reduce size and focus on relevant morphological areas. The images were carefully labeled and preprocessed to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset used to train the pre-trained convolutional neural network models VGG16, VGG19, and Inception-v3. The results were evaluated using the F1-score, achieving 82% for VGG16 and VGG19, while Inception-v3 reached an F1-score of 93%. Inception-v3's reliability was verified through model testing in uncontrolled environments, with positive results, complemented by the Grad-CAM technique, demonstrating its ability to capture essential morphological features. These findings indicate that Inception-v3 is an effective and replicable approach for classifying Anastrepha fraterculus and Ceratitis capitata, with potential for implementation in automated monitoring systems.

- **Summary**: The rise of vision-language foundation models marks an advancement in bridging the gap between human and machine capabilities in 3D scene reasoning. Existing 3D reasoning benchmarks assume real-time scene accessibility, which is impractical due to the high cost of frequent scene updates. To this end, we introduce Hypothetical 3D Reasoning, namely Hypo3D, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to reason without access to real-time scene data. Models need to imagine the scene state based on a provided change description before reasoning. Hypo3D is formulated as a 3D Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark, comprising 7,727 context changes across 700 indoor scenes, resulting in 14,885 question-answer pairs. An anchor-based world frame is established for all scenes, ensuring consistent reference to a global frame for directional terms in context changes and QAs. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art foundation models struggle to reason in hypothetically changed scenes. This reveals a substantial performance gap compared to humans, particularly in scenarios involving movement changes and directional reasoning. Even when the context change is irrelevant to the question, models often incorrectly adjust their answers.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation is vital for applications such as autonomous driving and virtual reality (VR). To effectively deploy these models in real-world scenarios, it is essential to employ cross-domain adaptation techniques that bridge the gap between training data and real-world data. Recently, self-training with pseudo-labels has emerged as a predominant method for cross-domain adaptation in multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation. However, generating reliable pseudo-labels necessitates stringent constraints, which often result in sparse pseudo-labels after pruning. This sparsity can potentially hinder performance improvement during the adaptation process. We propose an image-guided pseudo-label enhancement approach that leverages the complementary 2D prior knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to introduce more reliable pseudo-labels, thereby boosting domain adaptation performance. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and the SAM masks from its paired image data, we collect all 3D points covered by each SAM mask that potentially belong to the same object. Then our method refines the pseudo-labels within each SAM mask in two steps. First, we determine the class label for each mask using majority voting and employ various constraints to filter out unreliable mask labels. Next, we introduce Geometry-Aware Progressive Propagation (GAPP) which propagates the mask label to all 3D points within the SAM mask while avoiding outliers caused by 2D-3D misalignment. Experiments conducted across multiple datasets and domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method significantly increases the quantity of high-quality pseudo-labels and enhances the adaptation performance over baseline methods.
