- **Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are crucial for scaling model capacity while controlling inference costs. While integrating MoE into multimodal models like CLIP improves performance, training these models is notoriously challenging and expensive. We propose CLIP-Upcycling (CLIP-UP), an efficient alternative training strategy that converts a pre-trained dense CLIP model into a sparse MoE architecture. Through extensive experimentation with various settings and auxiliary losses, we demonstrate that CLIP-UP significantly reduces training complexity and cost. Remarkably, our sparse CLIP B/16 model, trained with CLIP-UP, outperforms its dense counterpart by 7.2% and 6.6% on COCO and Flickr30k text-to-image Recall@1 benchmarks respectively. It even surpasses the larger CLIP L/14 model on this task while using only 30% of the inference FLOPs. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our training recipe across different scales, establishing sparse upcycling as a practical and scalable approach for building efficient, high-performance CLIP models.

- **Summary**: Aligning diffusion models to downstream tasks often requires finetuning new models or gradient-based guidance at inference time to enable sampling from the reward-tilted posterior. In this work, we explore a simple inference-time gradient-free guidance approach, called controlled denoising (CoDe), that circumvents the need for differentiable guidance functions and model finetuning. CoDe is a blockwise sampling method applied during intermediate denoising steps, allowing for alignment with downstream rewards. Our experiments demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, CoDe offers a favorable trade-off between reward alignment, prompt instruction following, and inference cost, achieving a competitive performance against the state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: While Transformers have become the dominant architecture for visual generation, linear attention models, such as the state-space models (SSM), are increasingly recognized for their efficiency in processing long visual sequences. However, the essential efficiency of these models comes from formulating a limited recurrent state, enforcing causality among tokens that are prone to inconsistent modeling of N-dimensional visual data, leaving questions on their capacity to generate long non-causal sequences. In this paper, we explore the boundary of SSM on image and video generation by building the largest-scale diffusion SSM-Transformer hybrid model to date (5B parameters) based on the sub-quadratic bi-directional Hydra and self-attention, and generate up to 2K images and 360p 8 seconds (16 FPS) videos. Our results demonstrate that the model can produce faithful results aligned with complex text prompts and temporal consistent videos with high dynamics, suggesting the great potential of using SSMs for visual generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have shown impressive results in reducing the number of trainable parameters and memory requirements of large transformer networks while maintaining fine-tuning performance. However, the low-rank nature of the weight update inherently limits the representation power of fine-tuned models, potentially compromising performance on complex tasks. This raises a critical question: when a performance gap between LoRA and standard fine-tuning is observed, is it due to the reduced number of trainable parameters or the rank deficiency? This paper aims to answer this question by introducing RandLoRA, a parameter-efficient method that performs full-rank updates using a learned linear combinations of low-rank, non-trainable random matrices. Our method limits the number of trainable parameters by restricting optimization to diagonal scaling matrices applied to the fixed random matrices. This allows us to effectively overcome the low-rank limitations while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency during training. Through extensive experimentation across vision, language, and vision-language benchmarks, we systematically evaluate the limitations of LoRA and existing random basis methods. Our findings reveal that full-rank updates are beneficial across vision and language tasks individually, and even more so for vision-language tasks, where RandLoRA significantly reduces -- and sometimes eliminates -- the performance gap between standard fine-tuning and LoRA, demonstrating its efficacy.

- **Summary**: Outfit generation is a challenging task in the field of fashion technology, in which the aim is to create a collocated set of fashion items that complement a given set of items. Previous studies in this area have been limited to generating a unique set of fashion items based on a given set of items, without providing additional options to users. This lack of a diverse range of choices necessitates the development of a more versatile framework. However, when the task of generating collocated and diversified outfits is approached with multimodal image-to-image translation methods, it poses a challenging problem in terms of non-aligned image translation, which is hard to address with existing methods. In this research, we present FCBoost-Net, a new framework for outfit generation that leverages the power of pre-trained generative models to produce multiple collocated and diversified outfits. Initially, FCBoost-Net randomly synthesizes multiple sets of fashion items, and the compatibility of the synthesized sets is then improved in several rounds using a novel fashion compatibility booster. This approach was inspired by boosting algorithms and allows the performance to be gradually improved in multiple steps. Empirical evidence indicates that the proposed strategy can improve the fashion compatibility of randomly synthesized fashion items as well as maintain their diversity. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed framework with respect to visual authenticity, diversity, and fashion compatibility.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in foundation models have brought promising results in computer vision, including medical image segmentation. Fine-tuning foundation models on specific low-resource medical tasks has become a standard practice. However, ensuring reliable and robust model adaptation when the target task has a large domain gap and few annotated samples remains a challenge. Previous few-shot domain adaptation (FSDA) methods seek to bridge the distribution gap between source and target domains by utilizing auxiliary data. The selection and scheduling of auxiliaries are often based on heuristics, which can easily cause negative transfer. In this work, we propose an Active and Sequential domain AdaPtation (ASAP) framework for dynamic auxiliary dataset selection in FSDA. We formulate FSDA as a multi-armed bandit problem and derive an efficient reward function to prioritize training on auxiliary datasets that align closely with the target task, through a single-round fine-tuning. Empirical validation on diverse medical segmentation datasets demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art FSDA methods, achieving an average gain of 27.75% on MRI and 7.52% on CT datasets in Dice score.

- **Summary**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical image registration is essential for remote sensing data fusion, with applications in military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. However, challenges arise from differences in imaging mechanisms, geometric distortions, and radiometric properties between SAR and optical images. As image resolution increases, fine SAR textures become more significant, leading to alignment issues and 3D spatial discrepancies. Two major gaps exist: the lack of a publicly available multi-resolution, multi-scene registration dataset and the absence of systematic analysis of current methods. To address this, the MultiResSAR dataset was created, containing over 10k pairs of multi-source, multi-resolution, and multi-scene SAR and optical images. Sixteen state-of-the-art algorithms were tested. Results show no algorithm achieves 100% success, and performance decreases as resolution increases, with most failing on sub-meter data. XoFTR performs best among deep learning methods (40.58%), while RIFT performs best among traditional methods (66.51%). Future research should focus on noise suppression, 3D geometric fusion, cross-view transformation modeling, and deep learning optimization for robust registration of high-resolution SAR and optical images.

- **Summary**: Bin-picking is a practical and challenging robotic manipulation task, where accurate 6D pose estimation plays a pivotal role. The workpieces in bin-picking are typically textureless and randomly stacked in a bin, which poses a significant challenge to 6D pose estimation. Existing solutions are typically learning-based methods, which require object-specific training. Their efficiency of practical deployment for novel workpieces is highly limited by data collection and model retraining. Zero-shot 6D pose estimation is a potential approach to address the issue of deployment efficiency. Nevertheless, existing zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods are designed to leverage feature matching to establish point-to-point correspondences for pose estimation, which is less effective for workpieces with textureless appearances and ambiguous local regions. In this paper, we propose ZeroBP, a zero-shot pose estimation framework designed specifically for the bin-picking task. ZeroBP learns Position-Aware Correspondence (PAC) between the scene instance and its CAD model, leveraging both local features and global positions to resolve the mismatch issue caused by ambiguous regions with similar shapes and appearances. Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that ZeroBP outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot pose estimation methods, achieving an improvement of 9.1% in average recall of correct poses.

- **Summary**: $\chi$-separation is an advanced quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) method that is designed to generate paramagnetic ($\chi_{para}$) and diamagnetic ($|\chi_{dia}|$) susceptibility maps, reflecting the distribution of iron and myelin in the brain. However, vessels have shown artifacts, interfering with the accurate quantification of iron and myelin in applications. To address this challenge, a new vessel segmentation method for $\chi$-separation is developed. The method comprises three steps: 1) Seed generation from $\textit{R}_2^*$ and the product of $\chi_{para}$ and $|\chi_{dia}|$ maps; 2) Region growing, guided by vessel geometry, creating a vessel mask; 3) Refinement of the vessel mask by excluding non-vessel structures. The performance of the method was compared to conventional vessel segmentation methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. To demonstrate the utility of the method, it was tested in two applications: quantitative evaluation of a neural network-based $\chi$-separation reconstruction method ($\chi$-sepnet-$\textit{R}_2^*$) and population-averaged region of interest (ROI) analysis. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance to the conventional vessel segmentation methods, effectively excluding the non-vessel structures, achieving the highest Dice score coefficient. For the applications, applying vessel masks report notable improvements for the quantitative evaluation of $\chi$-sepnet-$\textit{R}_2^*$ and statistically significant differences in population-averaged ROI analysis. These applications suggest excluding vessels when analyzing the $\chi$-separation maps provide more accurate evaluations. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate various applications, offering reliable analysis through the generation of a high-quality vessel mask.

- **Summary**: Geo-localization is an essential component of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation systems to ensure precise absolute self-localization in outdoor environments. To address the challenges of GPS signal interruptions or low illumination, Thermal Geo-localization (TG) employs aerial thermal imagery to align with reference satellite maps to accurately determine the UAV's location. However, existing TG methods lack uncertainty measurement in their outputs, compromising system robustness in the presence of textureless or corrupted thermal images, self-similar or outdated satellite maps, geometric noises, or thermal images exceeding satellite maps. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents \textit{UASTHN}, a novel approach for Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in Deep Homography Estimation (DHE) tasks for TG applications. Specifically, we introduce a novel Crop-based Test-Time Augmentation (CropTTA) strategy, which leverages the homography consensus of cropped image views to effectively measure data uncertainty. This approach is complemented by Deep Ensembles (DE) employed for model uncertainty, offering comparable performance with improved efficiency and seamless integration with any DHE model. Extensive experiments across multiple DHE models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CropTTA in TG applications. Analysis of detected failure cases underscores the improved reliability of CropTTA under challenging conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of combining CropTTA and DE for a comprehensive assessment of both data and model uncertainty. Our research provides profound insights into the broader intersection of localization and uncertainty estimation. The code and data is publicly available.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present WonderHuman to reconstruct dynamic human avatars from a monocular video for high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Previous dynamic human avatar reconstruction methods typically require the input video to have full coverage of the observed human body. However, in daily practice, one typically has access to limited viewpoints, such as monocular front-view videos, making it a cumbersome task for previous methods to reconstruct the unseen parts of the human avatar. To tackle the issue, we present WonderHuman, which leverages 2D generative diffusion model priors to achieve high-quality, photorealistic reconstructions of dynamic human avatars from monocular videos, including accurate rendering of unseen body parts. Our approach introduces a Dual-Space Optimization technique, applying Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) in both canonical and observation spaces to ensure visual consistency and enhance realism in dynamic human reconstruction. Additionally, we present a View Selection strategy and Pose Feature Injection to enforce the consistency between SDS predictions and observed data, ensuring pose-dependent effects and higher fidelity in the reconstructed avatar. In the experiments, our method achieves SOTA performance in producing photorealistic renderings from the given monocular video, particularly for those challenging unseen parts.

- **Summary**: How much can we infer about an emotional voice solely from an expressive face? This intriguing question holds great potential for applications such as virtual character dubbing and aiding individuals with expressive language disorders. Existing face-to-speech methods offer great promise in capturing identity characteristics but struggle to generate diverse vocal styles with emotional expression. In this paper, we explore a new task, termed emotional face-to-speech, aiming to synthesize emotional speech directly from expressive facial cues. To that end, we introduce DEmoFace, a novel generative framework that leverages a discrete diffusion transformer (DiT) with curriculum learning, built upon a multi-level neural audio codec. Specifically, we propose multimodal DiT blocks to dynamically align text and speech while tailoring vocal styles based on facial emotion and identity. To enhance training efficiency and generation quality, we further introduce a coarse-to-fine curriculum learning algorithm for multi-level token processing. In addition, we develop an enhanced predictor-free guidance to handle diverse conditioning scenarios, enabling multi-conditional generation and disentangling complex attributes effectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DEmoFace generates more natural and consistent speech compared to baselines, even surpassing speech-driven methods.

- **Summary**: This thesis explores advanced approaches to improve explainability in computer vision by analyzing and modeling the features exploited by deep neural networks. Initially, it evaluates attribution methods, notably saliency maps, by introducing a metric based on algorithmic stability and an approach utilizing Sobol indices, which, through quasi-Monte Carlo sequences, allows a significant reduction in computation time. In addition, the EVA method offers a first formulation of attribution with formal guarantees via verified perturbation analysis.   Experimental results indicate that in complex scenarios these methods do not provide sufficient understanding, particularly because they identify only "where" the model focuses without clarifying "what" it perceives. Two hypotheses are therefore examined: aligning models with human reasoning -- through the introduction of a training routine that integrates the imitation of human explanations and optimization within the space of 1-Lipschitz functions -- and adopting a conceptual explainability approach.   The CRAFT method is proposed to automate the extraction of the concepts used by the model and to assess their importance, complemented by MACO, which enables their visualization. These works converge towards a unified framework, illustrated by an interactive demonstration applied to the 1000 ImageNet classes in a ResNet model.

- **Summary**: Preference optimization for diffusion models aims to align them with human preferences for images. Previous methods typically leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as pixel-level reward models to approximate human preferences. However, when used for step-level preference optimization, these models face challenges in handling noisy images of different timesteps and require complex transformations into pixel space. In this work, we demonstrate that diffusion models are inherently well-suited for step-level reward modeling in the latent space, as they can naturally extract features from noisy latent images. Accordingly, we propose the Latent Reward Model (LRM), which repurposes components of diffusion models to predict preferences of latent images at various timesteps. Building on LRM, we introduce Latent Preference Optimization (LPO), a method designed for step-level preference optimization directly in the latent space. Experimental results indicate that LPO not only significantly enhances performance in aligning diffusion models with general, aesthetic, and text-image alignment preferences, but also achieves 2.5-28$\times$ training speedup compared to existing preference optimization methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/casiatao/LPO.

- **Summary**: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) integrate visual and linguistic modalities, exhibiting exceptional performance across various multimodal tasks. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain vulnerable to the issue of object hallucinations. Previous efforts to mitigate this issue focus on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or incorporating external knowledge, both of which entail significant costs related to training and the acquisition of external data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model-agnostic approach termed Internal Fact-based Contrastive Decoding (IFCD), designed to mitigate and suppress hallucinations during the inference process of LVLMs by exploiting the LVLMs' own hallucinations. IFCD is grounded in experimental observations that alterations to the LVLMs' internal representations tend to amplify hallucinations caused by language bias. By contrasting disturbed distribution, IFCD calibrates the LVLMs' output and effectively removes the hallucinatory logits from the final predictions. Experimental results validate that IFCD significantly alleviates both object-level and attribute-level hallucinations while achieving an average 9% accuracy improvement on POPE and 8% accuracy improvement on MME object hallucinations subset compared with direct decoding, respectively.

- **Summary**: End-to-end human animation, such as audio-driven talking human generation, has undergone notable advancements in the recent few years. However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals). Video samples are provided on the ttfamily project page (https://omnihuman-lab.github.io)

- **Summary**: Collocated clothing synthesis using generative networks has become an emerging topic in the field of fashion intelligence, as it has significant potential economic value to increase revenue in the fashion industry. In previous studies, several works have attempted to synthesize visually-collocated clothing based on a given clothing item using generative adversarial networks (GANs) with promising results. These works, however, can only accomplish the synthesis of one collocated clothing item each time. Nevertheless, users may require different clothing items to meet their multiple choices due to their personal tastes and different dressing scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel batch clothing generation framework, named BC-GAN, which is able to synthesize multiple visually-collocated clothing images simultaneously. In particular, to further improve the fashion compatibility of synthetic results, BC-GAN proposes a new fashion compatibility discriminator in a contrastive learning perspective by fully exploiting the collocation relationship among all clothing items. Our model was examined in a large-scale dataset with compatible outfits constructed by ourselves. Extensive experiment results confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed BC-GAN in comparison to state-of-the-art methods in terms of diversity, visual authenticity, and fashion compatibility.

- **Summary**: The releases of OpenAI's o1 and o3 mark a significant paradigm shift in Large Language Models towards advanced reasoning capabilities. Notably, o3 outperformed humans in novel problem-solving and skill acquisition on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI). However, this benchmark is limited to symbolic patterns, whereas humans often perceive and reason about multimodal scenarios involving both vision and language data. Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate advanced reasoning capabilities in multimodal tasks. To this end, we track the evolution of the GPT-[n] and o-[n] series models on challenging multimodal puzzles, requiring fine-grained visual perception with abstract or algorithmic reasoning. The superior performance of o1 comes at nearly 750 times the computational cost of GPT-4o, raising concerns about its efficiency. Our results reveal a clear upward trend in reasoning capabilities across model iterations, with notable performance jumps across GPT-series models and subsequently to o1. Nonetheless, we observe that the o1 model still struggles with simple multimodal puzzles requiring abstract reasoning. Furthermore, its performance in algorithmic puzzles remains poor. We plan to continuously track new models in the series and update our results in this paper accordingly.

- **Summary**: Vision sensors are extensively used for localizing a robot's pose, particularly in environments where global localization tools such as GPS or motion capture systems are unavailable. In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller.

- **Summary**: Frequent, high-resolution remote sensing imagery is crucial for agricultural and environmental monitoring. Satellites from the Landsat collection offer detailed imagery at 30m resolution but with lower temporal frequency, whereas missions like MODIS and VIIRS provide daily coverage at coarser resolutions. Clouds and cloud shadows contaminate about 55\% of the optical remote sensing observations, posing additional challenges. To address these challenges, we present SatFlow, a generative model-based framework that fuses low-resolution MODIS imagery and Landsat observations to produce frequent, high-resolution, gap-free surface reflectance imagery. Our model, trained via Conditional Flow Matching, demonstrates better performance in generating imagery with preserved structural and spectral integrity. Cloud imputation is treated as an image inpainting task, where the model reconstructs cloud-contaminated pixels and fills gaps caused by scan lines during inference by leveraging the learned generative processes. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of our approach in reliably imputing cloud-covered regions. This capability is crucial for downstream applications such as crop phenology tracking, environmental change detection etc.,

- **Summary**: With the advancement of generative artificial intelligence, previous studies have achieved the task of generating aesthetic images from hand-drawn sketches, fulfilling the public's needs for drawing. However, these methods are limited to static images and lack the ability to control video animation generation using hand-drawn sketches. To address this gap, we propose VidSketch, the first method capable of generating high-quality video animations directly from any number of hand-drawn sketches and simple text prompts, bridging the divide between ordinary users and professional artists. Specifically, our method introduces a Level-Based Sketch Control Strategy to automatically adjust the guidance strength of sketches during the generation process, accommodating users with varying drawing skills. Furthermore, a TempSpatial Attention mechanism is designed to enhance the spatiotemporal consistency of generated video animations, significantly improving the coherence across frames.

- **Summary**: Lensless cameras disregard the conventional design that imaging should mimic the human eye. This is done by replacing the lens with a thin mask, and moving image formation to the digital post-processing. State-of-the-art lensless imaging techniques use learned approaches that combine physical modeling and neural networks. However, these approaches make simplifying modeling assumptions for ease of calibration and computation. Moreover, the generalizability of learned approaches to lensless measurements of new masks has not been studied. To this end, we utilize a modular learned reconstruction in which a key component is a pre-processor prior to image recovery. We theoretically demonstrate the pre-processor's necessity for standard image recovery techniques (Wiener filtering and iterative algorithms), and through extensive experiments show its effectiveness for multiple lensless imaging approaches and across datasets of different mask types (amplitude and phase). We also perform the first generalization benchmark across mask types to evaluate how well reconstructions trained with one system generalize to others. Our modular reconstruction enables us to use pre-trained components and transfer learning on new systems to cut down weeks of tedious measurements and training. As part of our work, we open-source four datasets, and software for measuring datasets and for training our modular reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Generating cognitive-aligned layered SVGs remains challenging due to existing methods' tendencies toward either oversimplified single-layer outputs or optimization-induced shape redundancies. We propose LayerTracer, a diffusion transformer based framework that bridges this gap by learning designers' layered SVG creation processes from a novel dataset of sequential design operations. Our approach operates in two phases: First, a text-conditioned DiT generates multi-phase rasterized construction blueprints that simulate human design workflows. Second, layer-wise vectorization with path deduplication produces clean, editable SVGs. For image vectorization, we introduce a conditional diffusion mechanism that encodes reference images into latent tokens, guiding hierarchical reconstruction while preserving structural integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate LayerTracer's superior performance against optimization-based and neural baselines in both generation quality and editability, effectively aligning AI-generated vectors with professional design cognition.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation, particularly in scenarios like multi-task learning that require frequent weight updates. However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://github.com/tuantuange/Lt-Di.

- **Summary**: Multimodal fake news detection has garnered significant attention due to its profound implications for social security. While existing approaches have contributed to understanding cross-modal consistency, they often fail to leverage modal-specific representations and explicit discrepant features. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Inverse Attention Network (MIAN), a novel framework that explores intrinsic discriminative features based on news content to advance fake news detection. Specifically, MIAN introduces a hierarchical learning module that captures diverse intra-modal relationships through local-to-global and local-to-local interactions, thereby generating enhanced unimodal representations to improve the identification of fake news at the intra-modal level. Additionally, a cross-modal interaction module employs a co-attention mechanism to establish and model dependencies between the refined unimodal representations, facilitating seamless semantic integration across modalities. To explicitly extract inconsistency features, we propose an inverse attention mechanism that effectively highlights the conflicting patterns and semantic deviations introduced by fake news in both intra- and inter-modality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MIAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its pivotal contribution to advancing social security through enhanced multimodal fake news detection.

- **Summary**: Research on differentiable scene representations is consistently moving towards more efficient, real-time models. Recently, this has led to the popularization of splatting methods, which eschew the traditional ray-based rendering of radiance fields in favor of rasterization. This has yielded a significant improvement in rendering speeds due to the efficiency of rasterization algorithms and hardware, but has come at a cost: the approximations that make rasterization efficient also make implementation of light transport phenomena like reflection and refraction much more difficult. We propose a novel scene representation which avoids these approximations, but keeps the efficiency and reconstruction quality of splatting by leveraging a decades-old efficient volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm which has been largely overlooked in recent computer vision research. The resulting model, which we name Radiant Foam, achieves rendering speed and quality comparable to Gaussian Splatting, without the constraints of rasterization. Unlike ray traced Gaussian models that use hardware ray tracing acceleration, our method requires no special hardware or APIs beyond the standard features of a programmable GPU.

- **Summary**: Multimodal fusion leverages information across modalities to learn better feature representations with the goal of improving performance in fusion-based tasks. However, multimodal datasets, especially in medical settings, are typically smaller than their unimodal counterparts, which can impede the performance of multimodal models. Additionally, the increase in the number of modalities is often associated with an overall increase in the size of the multimodal network, which may be undesirable in medical use cases. Utilizing smaller unimodal encoders may lead to sub-optimal performance, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional clinical data. In this paper, we propose the Modality-INformed knowledge Distillation (MIND) framework, a multimodal model compression approach based on knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge from ensembles of pre-trained deep neural networks of varying sizes into a smaller multimodal student. The teacher models consist of unimodal networks, allowing the student to learn from diverse representations. MIND employs multi-head joint fusion models, as opposed to single-head models, enabling the use of unimodal encoders in the case of unimodal samples without requiring imputation or masking of absent modalities. As a result, MIND generates an optimized multimodal model, enhancing both multimodal and unimodal representations. It can also be leveraged to balance multimodal learning during training. We evaluate MIND on binary and multilabel clinical prediction tasks using time series data and chest X-ray images. Additionally, we assess the generalizability of the MIND framework on three non-medical multimodal multiclass datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MIND enhances the performance of the smaller multimodal network across all five tasks, as well as various fusion methods and multimodal architectures, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: A novel onboard tracking approach enabling vision-based relative localization and communication using Active blinking Marker Tracking (AMT) is introduced in this article. Active blinking markers on multi-robot team members improve the robustness of relative localization for aerial vehicles in tightly coupled swarms during real-world deployments, while also serving as a resilient communication channel. Traditional tracking algorithms struggle to track fast moving blinking markers due to their intermittent appearance in the camera frames. AMT addresses this by using weighted polynomial regression to predict the future appearance of active blinking markers while accounting for uncertainty in the prediction. In outdoor experiments, the AMT approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods in tracking density, accuracy, and complexity. The experimental validation of this novel tracking approach for relative localization involved testing motion patterns motivated by our research on agile multi-robot deployment.

- **Summary**: Video inpainting aims to fill in corrupted regions of the video with plausible contents. Existing methods generally assume that the locations of corrupted regions are known, focusing primarily on the "how to inpaint". This reliance necessitates manual annotation of the corrupted regions using binary masks to indicate "whereto inpaint". However, the annotation of these masks is labor-intensive and expensive, limiting the practicality of current methods. In this paper, we expect to relax this assumption by defining a new blind video inpainting setting, enabling the networks to learn the mapping from corrupted video to inpainted result directly, eliminating the need of corrupted region annotations. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end blind video inpainting network (BVINet) to address both "where to inpaint" and "how to inpaint" simultaneously. On the one hand, BVINet can predict the masks of corrupted regions by detecting semantic-discontinuous regions of the frame and utilizing temporal consistency prior of the video. On the other hand, the predicted masks are incorporated into the BVINet, allowing it to capture valid context information from uncorrupted regions to fill in corrupted ones. Besides, we introduce a consistency loss to regularize the training parameters of BVINet. In this way, mask prediction and video completion mutually constrain each other, thereby maximizing the overall performance of the trained model. Furthermore, we customize a dataset consisting of synthetic corrupted videos, real-world corrupted videos, and their corresponding completed videos. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing blind video inpainting research. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: Few-shot learning (FSL) has recently been extensively utilized to overcome the scarcity of training data in domain-specific visual recognition. In real-world scenarios, environmental factors such as complex backgrounds, varying lighting conditions, long-distance shooting, and moving targets often cause test images to exhibit numerous incomplete targets or noise disruptions. However, current research on evaluation datasets and methodologies has largely ignored the concept of "environmental robustness", which refers to maintaining consistent performance in complex and diverse physical environments. This neglect has led to a notable decline in the performance of FSL models during practical testing compared to their training performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new real-world multi-domain few-shot learning (RD-FSL) benchmark, which includes four domains and six evaluation datasets. The test images in this benchmark feature various challenging elements, such as camouflaged objects, small targets, and blurriness. Our evaluation experiments reveal that existing methods struggle to utilize training images effectively to generate accurate feature representations for challenging test images. To address this problem, we propose a novel conditional representation learning network (CRLNet) that integrates the interactions between training and testing images as conditional information in their respective representation processes. The main goal is to reduce intra-class variance or enhance inter-class variance at the feature representation level. Finally, comparative experiments reveal that CRLNet surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance improvements ranging from 6.83% to 16.98% across diverse settings and backbones.

- **Summary**: The analyses of ancient coins, and especially the identification of those struck with the same die, provides invaluable information for archaeologists and historians. Nowadays, these die links are identified manually, which makes the process laborious, if not impossible when big treasures are discovered as the number of comparisons is too large. This study introduces advances that promise to streamline and enhance archaeological coin analysis. Our contributions include: 1) First publicly accessible labeled dataset of coin pictures (329 images) for die link detection, facilitating method benchmarking; 2) Novel SSIM-based scoring method for rapid and accurate discrimination of coin pairs, outperforming current techniques used in this research field; 3) Evaluation of clustering techniques using our score, demonstrating near-perfect die link identification. We provide datasets, to foster future research and the development of even more powerful tools for archaeology, and more particularly for numismatics.

- **Summary**: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.

- **Summary**: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to enhance interpretability by predicting human-understandable concepts as intermediates for decision-making. However, these models often face challenges in ensuring reliable concept representations, which can propagate to downstream tasks and undermine robustness, especially under distribution shifts. Two inherent issues contribute to concept unreliability: sensitivity to concept-irrelevant features (e.g., background variations) and lack of semantic consistency for the same concept across different samples. To address these limitations, we propose the Reliability-Enhanced Concept Embedding Model (RECEM), which introduces a two-fold strategy: Concept-Level Disentanglement to separate irrelevant features from concept-relevant information and a Concept Mixup mechanism to ensure semantic alignment across samples. These mechanisms work together to improve concept reliability, enabling the model to focus on meaningful object attributes and generate faithful concept representations. Experimental results demonstrate that RECEM consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets, showing superior performance under background and domain shifts. These findings highlight the effectiveness of disentanglement and alignment strategies in enhancing both reliability and robustness in CBMs.

- **Summary**: Model quantization is widely applied for compressing and accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs). However, conventional Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) focuses on training DNNs with uniform bit-width. The bit-width settings vary across different hardware and transmission demands, which induces considerable training and storage costs. Hence, the scheme of one-shot joint training multiple precisions is proposed to address this issue. Previous works either store a larger FP32 model to switch between different precision models for higher accuracy or store a smaller INT8 model but compromise accuracy due to using shared quantization parameters. In this paper, we introduce the Double Rounding quantization method, which fully utilizes the quantized representation range to accomplish nearly lossless bit-switching while reducing storage by using the highest integer precision instead of full precision. Furthermore, we observe a competitive interference among different precisions during one-shot joint training, primarily due to inconsistent gradients of quantization scales during backward propagation. To tackle this problem, we propose an Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling (ALRS) technique that dynamically adapts learning rates for various precisions to optimize the training process. Additionally, we extend our Double Rounding to one-shot mixed precision training and develop a Hessian-Aware Stochastic Bit-switching (HASB) strategy. Experimental results on the ImageNet-1K classification demonstrate that our methods have enough advantages to state-of-the-art one-shot joint QAT in both multi-precision and mixed-precision. We also validate the feasibility of our method on detection and segmentation tasks, as well as on LLMs task. Our codes are available at https://github.com/haiduo/Double-Rounding.

- **Summary**: Traditional Anomaly Detection (AD) methods have predominantly relied on unsupervised learning from extensive normal data. Recent AD methods have evolved with the advent of large pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing few-shot anomaly detection capabilities. However, these latest AD methods still exhibit limitations in accuracy improvement. One contributing factor is their direct comparison of a query image's features with those of few-shot normal images. This direct comparison often leads to a loss of precision and complicates the extension of these techniques to more complex domains--an area that remains underexplored in a more refined and comprehensive manner. To address these limitations, we introduce the anomaly personalization method, which performs a personalized one-to-normal transformation of query images using an anomaly-free customized generation model, ensuring close alignment with the normal manifold. Moreover, to further enhance the stability and robustness of prediction results, we propose a triplet contrastive anomaly inference strategy, which incorporates a comprehensive comparison between the query and generated anomaly-free data pool and prompt information. Extensive evaluations across eleven datasets in three domains demonstrate our model's effectiveness compared to the latest AD methods. Additionally, our method has been proven to transfer flexibly to other AD methods, with the generated image data effectively improving the performance of other AD methods.

- **Summary**: Due to the trade-off between the temporal and spatial resolution of thermal spaceborne sensors, super-resolution methods have been developed to provide fine-scale Land SurfaceTemperature (LST) maps. Most of them are trained at low resolution but applied at fine resolution, and so they require a scale-invariance hypothesis that is not always adapted. Themain contribution of this work is the introduction of a Scale-Invariance-Free approach for training Neural Network (NN) models, and the implementation of two NN models, calledScale-Invariance-Free Convolutional Neural Network for Super-Resolution (SIF-CNN-SR) for the super-resolution of MODIS LST products. The Scale-Invariance-Free approach consists ontraining the models in order to provide LST maps at high spatial resolution that recover the initial LST when they are degraded at low resolution and that contain fine-scale texturesinformed by the high resolution NDVI. The second contribution of this work is the release of a test database with ASTER LST images concomitant with MODIS ones that can be usedfor evaluation of super-resolution algorithms. We compare the two proposed models, SIF-CNN-SR1 and SIF-CNN-SR2, with four state-of-the-art methods, Bicubic, DMS, ATPRK, Tsharp,and a CNN sharing the same architecture as SIF-CNN-SR but trained under the scale-invariance hypothesis. We show that SIF-CNN-SR1 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and the other two CNN models as evaluated with LPIPS and Fourier space metrics focusing on the analysis of textures. These results and the available ASTER-MODIS database for evaluation are promising for future studies on super-resolution of LST.

- **Summary**: Industrial defect segmentation is critical for manufacturing quality control. Due to the scarcity of training defect samples, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) holds significant value in this field. However, existing studies mostly apply FSS to tackle defects on simple textures, without considering more diverse scenarios. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring FSS in broader industrial products with various defect types. To this end, we contribute a new real-world dataset and reorganize some existing datasets to build a more comprehensive few-shot defect segmentation (FDS) benchmark. On this benchmark, we thoroughly investigate metric learning-based FSS methods, including those based on meta-learning and those based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). We observe that existing meta-learning-based methods are generally not well-suited for this task, while VFMs hold great potential. We further systematically study the applicability of various VFMs in this task, involving two paradigms: feature matching and the use of Segment Anything (SAM) models. We propose a novel efficient FDS method based on feature matching. Meanwhile, we find that SAM2 is particularly effective for addressing FDS through its video track mode. The contributed dataset and code will be available at: https://github.com/liutongkun/GFDS.

- **Summary**: Pre-training vision-language representations on human action videos has emerged as a promising approach to reduce reliance on large-scale expert demonstrations for training embodied agents. However, prior methods often employ time contrastive learning based on goal-reaching heuristics, progressively aligning language instructions from the initial to the final frame. This overemphasis on future frames can result in erroneous vision-language associations, as actions may terminate early or include irrelevant moments in the end. To address this issue, we propose Action Temporal Coherence Learning (AcTOL) to learn ordered and continuous vision-language representations without rigid goal-based constraint. AcTOL treats a video as a continuous trajectory where it (1) contrasts semantic differences between frames to reflect their natural ordering, and (2) imposes a local Brownian bridge constraint to ensure smooth transitions across intermediate frames. Extensive imitation learning experiments across varying numbers of demonstrations show that the pretrained features significantly enhance downstream manipulation tasks by up to 49% with high robustness to different linguistic styles of instructions, offering a viable pathway toward generalized embodied agents. The source code is included in the supplementary material for reference.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates scalable neural networks with learnable activation functions based on orthogonal function bases and tropical polynomials, targeting ImageNet-1K classification and next token prediction on OpenWebText. Traditional activations, such as ReLU, are static. In contrast, learnable activations enable the network to adapt dynamically during training. However, stability issues, such as vanishing or exploding gradients, arise with improper variance management in deeper networks. To remedy this, we propose an initialization scheme that single-handedly preserves unitary variance in transformers and convolutional networks, ensuring stable gradient flow even in deep architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that networks with Hermite, Fourier, and Tropical-based learnable activations significantly improve over GPT-2 and ConvNeXt networks in terms of accuracy and perplexity in train and test, highlighting the viability of learnable activations in large-scale tasks. The activation functions developed here are the subject of a library coded entirely in pure PyTorch: torchortho, available at https://github.com/K-H-Ismail/torchortho.

- **Summary**: Transferability, the ability of adversarial examples crafted for one model to deceive other models, is crucial for black-box attacks. Despite advancements in attack methods for semantic segmentation, transferability remains limited, reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce the Feature Similarity Projected Gradient Descent (FSPGD) attack, a novel black-box approach that enhances both attack performance and transferability. Unlike conventional segmentation attacks that rely on output predictions for gradient calculation, FSPGD computes gradients from intermediate layer features. Specifically, our method introduces a loss function that targets local information by comparing features between clean images and adversarial examples, while also disrupting contextual information by accounting for spatial relationships between objects. Experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that FSPGD achieves superior transferability and attack performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark. Code is available at https://github.com/KU-AIVS/FSPGD.

- **Summary**: Reliable road segmentation in all weather conditions is critical for intelligent transportation applications, autonomous vehicles and advanced driver's assistance systems. For robust performance, all weather conditions should be included in the training data of deep learning-based perception models. However, collecting and annotating such a dataset requires extensive resources. In this paper, existing roadside camera infrastructure is utilized for collecting road data in varying weather conditions automatically. Additionally, a novel semi-automatic annotation method for roadside cameras is proposed. For each camera, only one frame is labeled manually and then the label is transferred to other frames of that camera feed. The small camera movements between frames are compensated using frequency domain image registration. The proposed method is validated with roadside camera data collected from 927 cameras across Finland over 4 month time period during winter. Training on the semi-automatically labeled data boosted the segmentation performance of several deep learning segmentation models. Testing was carried out on two different datasets to evaluate the robustness of the resulting models. These datasets were an in-domain roadside camera dataset and out-of-domain dataset captured with a vehicle on-board camera.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a new variant of an algorithm for normalized cross-correlation (NCC) is proposed in the context of template matching in images. The proposed algorithm is based on the precomputation of a template image approximation, enabling more efficient calculation of approximate NCC with the source image than using the original template for exact NCC calculation. The approximate template is precomputed from the template image by a split-and-merge approach, resulting in a decomposition to axis-aligned rectangular segments, whose sizes depend on per-segment pixel intensity variance. In the approximate template, each segment is assigned the mean grayscale value of the corresponding pixels from the original template. The proposed algorithm achieves superior computational performance with negligible NCC approximation errors compared to the well-known Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based NCC algorithm, when applied on less visually complex and/or smaller template images. In other cases, the proposed algorithm can maintain either computational performance or NCC approximation error within the range of the FFT-based algorithm, but not both.

- **Summary**: The availability of foundational models (FMs) pre-trained on large-scale data has advanced the state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks. While FMs have demonstrated good zero-shot performance on many image classification tasks, there is often scope for performance improvement by adapting the FM to the downstream task. However, the data that is required for this adaptation typically exists in silos across multiple entities (data owners) and cannot be collated at a central location due to regulations and privacy concerns. At the same time, a learning service provider (LSP) who owns the FM cannot share the model with the data owners due to proprietary reasons. In some cases, the data owners may not even have the resources to store such large FMs. Hence, there is a need for algorithms to adapt the FM in a double-blind federated manner, i.e., the data owners do not know the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see the data for the downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a framework for double-blind federated adaptation of FMs using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). The proposed framework first decomposes the FM into a sequence of FHE-friendly blocks through knowledge distillation. The resulting FHE-friendly model is adapted for the downstream task via low-rank parallel adapters that can be learned without backpropagation through the FM. Since the proposed framework requires the LSP to share intermediate representations with the data owners, we design a privacy-preserving permutation scheme to prevent the data owners from learning the FM through model extraction attacks. Finally, a secure aggregation protocol is employed for federated learning of the low-rank parallel adapters. Empirical results on four datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach to Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO), focusing on the initialization and feature matching modules. Existing methods for initialization often suffer from either poor stability in visual Structure from Motion (SfM) or fragility in solving a huge number of parameters simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose a new pipeline for visual inertial initialization that robustly handles various complex scenarios. By tightly coupling gyroscope measurements, we enhance the robustness and accuracy of visual SfM. Our method demonstrates stable performance even with only four image frames, yielding competitive results. In terms of feature matching, we introduce a hybrid method that combines optical flow and descriptor-based matching. By leveraging the robustness of continuous optical flow tracking and the accuracy of descriptor matching, our approach achieves efficient, accurate, and robust tracking results. Through evaluation on multiple benchmarks, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and success rate. Additionally, a video demonstration on mobile devices showcases the practical applicability of our approach in the field of Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR).

- **Summary**: Designing a module or mechanism that enables a network to maintain low parameters and FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and throughput remains a challenge. To address this challenge and exploit the redundancy within feature map channels, we propose a new solution: partial channel mechanism (PCM). Specifically, through the split operation, the feature map channels are divided into different parts, with each part corresponding to different operations, such as convolution, attention, pooling, and identity mapping. Based on this assumption, we introduce a novel partial attention convolution (PATConv) that can efficiently combine convolution with visual attention. Our exploration indicates that the PATConv can completely replace both the regular convolution and the regular visual attention while reducing model parameters and FLOPs. Moreover, PATConv can derive three new types of blocks: Partial Channel-Attention block (PAT_ch), Partial Spatial-Attention block (PAT_sp), and Partial Self-Attention block (PAT_sf). In addition, we propose a novel dynamic partial convolution (DPConv) that can adaptively learn the proportion of split channels in different layers to achieve better trade-offs. Building on PATConv and DPConv, we propose a new hybrid network family, named PartialNet, which achieves superior top-1 accuracy and inference speed compared to some SOTA models on ImageNet-1K classification and excels in both detection and segmentation on the COCO dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/haiduo/PartialNet.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel method for conditioning diffusion-based image synthesis models with heterogeneous graph data. Existing approaches typically incorporate conditioning variables directly into model architectures, either through cross-attention layers that attend to text latents or image concatenation that spatially restrict generation. However, these methods struggle to handle complex scenarios involving diverse, relational conditioning variables, which are more naturally represented as unstructured graphs. This paper presents Heterogeneous Image Graphs (HIG), a novel representation that models conditioning variables and target images as two interconnected graphs, enabling efficient handling of variable-length conditioning inputs and their relationships. We also propose a magnitude-preserving GNN that integrates the HIG into the existing EDM2 diffusion model using a ControlNet approach. Our approach improves upon the SOTA on a variety of conditioning inputs for the COCO-stuff and Visual Genome datasets, and showcases the ability to condition on graph attributes and relationships represented by edges in the HIG.

- **Summary**: Category-level object pose estimation aims to recover the rotation, translation and size of unseen instances within predefined categories. In this task, deep neural network-based methods have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, previous studies show they suffer from spurious correlations raised by "unclean" confounders in models, hindering their performance on novel instances with significant variations. To address this issue, we propose CleanPose, a novel approach integrating causal learning and knowledge distillation to enhance category-level pose estimation. To mitigate the negative effect of unobserved confounders, we develop a causal inference module based on front-door adjustment, which promotes unbiased estimation by reducing potential spurious correlations. Additionally, to further improve generalization ability, we devise a residual-based knowledge distillation method that has proven effective in providing comprehensive category information guidance. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks (REAL275, CAMERA25 and HouseCat6D) hightlight the superiority of proposed CleanPose over state-of-the-art methods. Code will be released.

- **Summary**: Focal deficits in ischaemic stroke result from impaired perfusion downstream of a critical vascular occlusion. While parenchymal lesions are traditionally used to predict clinical deficits, the underlying pattern of disrupted perfusion provides information upstream of the lesion, potentially yielding earlier predictive and localizing signals. Such perfusion maps can be derived from routine CT angiography (CTA) widely deployed in clinical practice. Analysing computed perfusion maps from 1,393 CTA-imaged-patients with acute ischaemic stroke, we use deep generative inference to localise neural substrates of NIHSS sub-scores. We show that our approach replicates known lesion-deficit relations without knowledge of the lesion itself and reveals novel neural dependents. The high achieved anatomical fidelity suggests acute CTA-derived computed perfusion maps may be of substantial clinical-and-scientific value in rich phenotyping of acute stroke. Using only hyperacute imaging, deep generative inference could power highly expressive models of functional anatomical relations in ischaemic stroke within the pre-interventional window.

- **Summary**: While traditional self-supervised learning methods improve performance and robustness across various medical tasks, they rely on single-vector embeddings that may not capture fine-grained concepts such as anatomical structures or organs. The ability to identify such concepts and their characteristics without supervision has the potential to improve pre-training methods, and enable novel applications such as fine-grained image retrieval and concept-based outlier detection. In this paper, we introduce ConceptVAE, a novel pre-training framework that detects and disentangles fine-grained concepts from their style characteristics in a self-supervised manner. We present a suite of loss terms and model architecture primitives designed to discretise input data into a preset number of concepts along with their local style. We validate ConceptVAE both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating its ability to detect fine-grained anatomical structures such as blood pools and septum walls from 2D cardiac echocardiographies. Quantitatively, ConceptVAE outperforms traditional self-supervised methods in tasks such as region-based instance retrieval, semantic segmentation, out-of-distribution detection, and object detection. Additionally, we explore the generation of in-distribution synthetic data that maintains the same concepts as the training data but with distinct styles, highlighting its potential for more calibrated data generation. Overall, our study introduces and validates a promising new pre-training technique based on concept-style disentanglement, opening multiple avenues for developing models for medical image analysis that are more interpretable and explainable than black-box approaches.

- **Summary**: Deep learning on non-Euclidean domains is important for analyzing complex geometric data that lacks common coordinate systems and familiar Euclidean properties. A central challenge in this field is to define convolution on domains, which inherently possess irregular and non-Euclidean structures. In this work, we introduce Quasi-conformal Convolution (QCC), a novel framework for defining convolution on Riemann surfaces using quasi-conformal theories. Each QCC operator is linked to a specific quasi-conformal mapping, enabling the adjustment of the convolution operation through manipulation of this mapping. By utilizing trainable estimator modules that produce Quasi-conformal mappings, QCC facilitates adaptive and learnable convolution operators that can be dynamically adjusted according to the underlying data structured on Riemann surfaces. QCC unifies a broad range of spatially defined convolutions, facilitating the learning of tailored convolution operators on each underlying surface optimized for specific tasks. Building on this foundation, we develop the Quasi-Conformal Convolutional Neural Network (QCCNN) to address a variety of tasks related to geometric data. We validate the efficacy of QCCNN through the classification of images defined on curvilinear Riemann surfaces, demonstrating superior performance in this context. Additionally, we explore its potential in medical applications, including craniofacial analysis using 3D facial data and lesion segmentation on 3D human faces, achieving enhanced accuracy and reliability.

- **Summary**: Accurate 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is vital for autonomous vehicles, yet LiDAR and camera-based methods degrade in adverse weather. Meanwhile, Radar-based solutions remain robust but often suffer from limited vertical resolution and simplistic motion models. Existing Kalman filter-based approaches also rely on fixed noise covariance, hampering adaptability when objects make sudden maneuvers. We propose Bayes-4DRTrack, a 4D Radar-based MOT framework that adopts a transformer-based motion prediction network to capture nonlinear motion dynamics and employs Bayesian approximation in both detection and prediction steps. Moreover, our two-stage data association leverages Doppler measurements to better distinguish closely spaced targets. Evaluated on the K-Radar dataset (including adverse weather scenarios), Bayes-4DRTrack demonstrates a 5.7% gain in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (AMOTA) over methods with traditional motion models and fixed noise covariance. These results showcase enhanced robustness and accuracy in demanding, real-world conditions.

In particular, inspired by diffusion models we propose to consider a sequence $(\pi^{t_k})_k$ of approximations of the target density, for which $\pi^{t_k}\approx \pi$ for $k$ small and, on the other hand, $\pi^{t_k}$ exhibits favorable properties for sampling for $k$ large. This sequence is obtained by replacing parts of the potential $U$ by its Moreau envelopes. Sampling is performed in an Annealed Langevin type procedure, that is, sequentially sampling from $\pi^{t_k}$ for decreasing $k$, effectively guiding the samples from a simple starting density to the more complex target. In addition to a theoretical analysis we show experimental results supporting the efficacy of the method in terms of increased convergence speed and applicability to multi-modal densities $\pi$.

- **Summary**: Learning diffusion bridge models is easy; making them fast and practical is an art. Diffusion bridge models (DBMs) are a promising extension of diffusion models for applications in image-to-image translation. However, like many modern diffusion and flow models, DBMs suffer from the problem of slow inference. To address it, we propose a novel distillation technique based on the inverse bridge matching formulation and derive the tractable objective to solve it in practice. Unlike previously developed DBM distillation techniques, the proposed method can distill both conditional and unconditional types of DBMs, distill models in a one-step generator, and use only the corrupted images for training. We evaluate our approach for both conditional and unconditional types of bridge matching on a wide set of setups, including super-resolution, JPEG restoration, sketch-to-image, and other tasks, and show that our distillation technique allows us to accelerate the inference of DBMs from 4x to 100x and even provide better generation quality than used teacher model depending on particular setup.

- **Summary**: Blind dehazed image quality assessment (BDQA), which aims to accurately predict the visual quality of dehazed images without any reference information, is essential for the evaluation, comparison, and optimization of image dehazing algorithms. Existing learning-based BDQA methods have achieved remarkable success, while the small scale of DQA datasets limits their performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to adapt Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP), pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs, to the BDQA task. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the human visual system understands images based on hierarchical features, we take global and local information of the dehazed image as the input of CLIP. To accurately map the input hierarchical information of dehazed images into the quality score, we tune both the vision branch and language branch of CLIP with prompt learning. Experimental results on two authentic DQA datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach, named CLIP-DQA, achieves more accurate quality predictions over existing BDQA methods.

- **Summary**: Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) has been found to be vulnerable to poisoning backdoor attacks where the adversary can achieve an almost perfect attack success rate on CLIP models by poisoning only 0.01\% of the training dataset. This raises security concerns on the current practice of pretraining large-scale models on unscrutinized web data using CLIP. In this work, we analyze the representations of backdoor-poisoned samples learned by CLIP models and find that they exhibit unique characteristics in their local subspace, i.e., their local neighborhoods are far more sparse than that of clean samples. Based on this finding, we conduct a systematic study on detecting CLIP backdoor attacks and show that these attacks can be easily and efficiently detected by traditional density ratio-based local outlier detectors, whereas existing backdoor sample detection methods fail. Our experiments also reveal that an unintentional backdoor already exists in the original CC3M dataset and has been trained into a popular open-source model released by OpenCLIP. Based on our detector, one can clean up a million-scale web dataset (e.g., CC3M) efficiently within 15 minutes using 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/HanxunH/Detect-CLIP-Backdoor-Samples}{GitHub repository}.

- **Summary**: Accurate detection of traffic anomalies is crucial for effective urban traffic management and congestion mitigation. We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.

- **Summary**: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) is challenging because of the requirement of understanding on visual information, language and spatial relationships. While supervised approaches have achieved superior performance, they are constrained by the scarcity and high cost of 3D vision-language datasets. On the other hand, LLM/VLM based agents are proposed for 3DVG, eliminating the need for training data. However, these methods incur prohibitive time and token costs during inference. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel training-free symbolic framework for 3D visual grounding, namely Evolvable Symbolic Visual Grounder, that offers significantly reduced inference costs compared to previous agent-based methods while maintaining comparable performance. EaSe uses LLM generated codes to compute on spatial relationships. EaSe also implements an automatic pipeline to evaluate and optimize the quality of these codes and integrate VLMs to assist in the grounding process. Experimental results demonstrate that EaSe achieves 52.9% accuracy on Nr3D dataset and 49.2% Acc@0.25 on ScanRefer, which is top-tier among training-free methods. Moreover, it substantially reduces the inference time and cost, offering a balanced trade-off between performance and efficiency. Codes are available at https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/EaSe.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their substantial memory requirements present significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has emerged as a promising compression technique for LLMs, offering considerable reductions in memory overhead. However, existing SVD-based methods often struggle to effectively mitigate the errors introduced by SVD truncation, leading to a noticeable performance gap when compared to the original models. Furthermore, applying a uniform compression ratio across all transformer layers fails to account for the varying importance of different layers. To address these challenges, we propose AdaSVD, an adaptive SVD-based LLM compression approach. Specifically, AdaSVD introduces adaComp, which adaptively compensates for SVD truncation errors by alternately updating the singular matrices U and V^T. Additionally, AdaSVD introduces adaCR, which adaptively assigns layer-specific compression ratios based on the relative importance of each layer. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics demonstrate that AdaSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SVD-based methods, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced memory requirements.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce FourieRF, a novel approach for achieving fast and high-quality reconstruction in the few-shot setting. Our method effectively parameterizes features through an explicit curriculum training procedure, incrementally increasing scene complexity during optimization. Experimental results show that the prior induced by our approach is both robust and adaptable across a wide variety of scenes, establishing FourieRF as a strong and versatile baseline for the few-shot rendering problem. While our approach significantly reduces artifacts, it may still lead to reconstruction errors in severely under-constrained scenarios, particularly where view occlusion leaves parts of the shape uncovered. In the future, our method could be enhanced by integrating foundation models to complete missing parts using large data-driven priors.

- **Summary**: Human body restoration, as a specific application of image restoration, is widely applied in practice and plays a vital role across diverse fields. However, thorough research remains difficult, particularly due to the lack of benchmark datasets. In this study, we propose a high-quality dataset automated cropping and filtering (HQ-ACF) pipeline. This pipeline leverages existing object detection datasets and other unlabeled images to automatically crop and filter high-quality human images. Using this pipeline, we constructed a person-based restoration with sophisticated objects and natural activities (\emph{PERSONA}) dataset, which includes training, validation, and test sets. The dataset significantly surpasses other human-related datasets in both quality and content richness. Finally, we propose \emph{OSDHuman}, a novel one-step diffusion model for human body restoration. Specifically, we propose a high-fidelity image embedder (HFIE) as the prompt generator to better guide the model with low-quality human image information, effectively avoiding misleading prompts. Experimental results show that OSDHuman outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. The dataset and code will at https://github.com/gobunu/OSDHuman.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging generally requires long exposure times, while being sensitive to patient motion, resulting in artifacts in the acquired images, which may hinder their diagnostic relevance. Despite research efforts to decrease the acquisition time, and designing efficient acquisition sequences, motion artifacts are still a persistent problem, pushing toward the need for the development of automatic motion artifact correction techniques. Recently, diffusion models have been proposed as a solution for the task at hand. While diffusion models can produce high-quality reconstructions, they are also susceptible to hallucination, which poses risks in diagnostic applications. In this study, we critically evaluate the use of diffusion models for correcting motion artifacts in 2D brain MRI scans. Using a popular benchmark dataset, we compare a diffusion model-based approach with state-of-the-art methods consisting of Unets trained in a supervised fashion on motion-affected images to reconstruct ground truth motion-free images. Our findings reveal mixed results: diffusion models can produce accurate predictions or generate harmful hallucinations in this context, depending on data heterogeneity and the acquisition planes considered as input.

- **Summary**: Detailed image captioning is essential for tasks like data generation and aiding visually impaired individuals. High-quality captions require a balance between precision and recall, which remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we hypothesize that this limitation stems from weakening and increasingly noisy visual attention as responses lengthen. To address this issue, we propose SPARC (Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration), a training-free method that enhances the contribution of visual tokens during decoding. SPARC is founded on three key observations: (1) increasing the influence of all visual tokens reduces recall; thus, SPARC selectively amplifies visual tokens; (2) as captions lengthen, visual attention becomes noisier, so SPARC identifies critical visual tokens by leveraging attention differences across time steps; (3) as visual attention gradually weakens, SPARC reinforces it to preserve its influence. Our experiments, incorporating both automated and human evaluations, demonstrate that existing methods improve the precision of MLLMs at the cost of recall. In contrast, our proposed method enhances both precision and recall with minimal computational overhead.

- **Summary**: Artificial neural networks face the stability-plasticity dilemma in continual learning, while the brain can maintain memories and remain adaptable. However, the biological strategies for continual learning and their potential to inspire learning algorithms in neural networks are poorly understood. This study presents a minimal model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate the biological strategies that support continual odor learning. We introduce the fly olfactory circuit as a plug-and-play component, termed the Fly Model, which can integrate with modern machine learning methods to address this dilemma. Our findings demonstrate that the Fly Model enhances both memory stability and learning plasticity, overcoming the limitations of current continual learning strategies. We validated its effectiveness across various challenging continual learning scenarios using commonly used datasets. The fly olfactory system serves as an elegant biological circuit for lifelong learning, offering a module that enhances continual learning with minimal additional computational cost for machine learning.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of modern transportation systems and the exponential growth of logistics volumes, intelligent X-ray-based security inspection systems play a crucial role in public safety. Although single-view X-ray equipment is widely deployed, it struggles to accurately identify contraband in complex stacking scenarios due to strong viewpoint dependency and inadequate feature representation. To address this, we propose an innovative multi-scale interactive feature fusion framework tailored for dual-view X-ray security inspection image classification. The framework comprises three core modules: the Frequency Domain Interaction Module (FDIM) enhances frequency-domain features through Fourier transform; the Multi-Scale Cross-View Feature Enhancement (MSCFE) leverages cross-view attention mechanisms to strengthen feature interactions; and the Convolutional Attention Fusion Module (CAFM) efficiently fuses features by integrating channel attention with depthwise-separable convolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple backbone architectures, particularly excelling in complex scenarios with occlusions and object stacking.

- **Summary**: Consistency models are a new family of generative models capable of producing high-quality samples in either a single step or multiple steps. Recently, consistency models have demonstrated impressive performance, achieving results on par with diffusion models in the pixel space. However, the success of scaling consistency training to large-scale datasets, particularly for text-to-image and video generation tasks, is determined by performance in the latent space. In this work, we analyze the statistical differences between pixel and latent spaces, discovering that latent data often contains highly impulsive outliers, which significantly degrade the performance of iCT in the latent space. To address this, we replace Pseudo-Huber losses with Cauchy losses, effectively mitigating the impact of outliers. Additionally, we introduce a diffusion loss at early timesteps and employ optimal transport (OT) coupling to further enhance performance. Lastly, we introduce the adaptive scaling-$c$ scheduler to manage the robust training process and adopt Non-scaling LayerNorm in the architecture to better capture the statistics of the features and reduce outlier impact. With these strategies, we successfully train latent consistency models capable of high-quality sampling with one or two steps, significantly narrowing the performance gap between latent consistency and diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Defect detection in fabrics is critical for quality control, yet existing methods often struggle with complex backgrounds and shape-specific defects. In this paper, we propose an improved fabric defect detection model based on YOLOv11. To enhance the detection of strip defects, we introduce a Strip Perception Module (SPM) that improves feature capture through multi-scale convolution. We further enhance the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) by integrating a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, resulting in the SE-SPPF module, which better integrates spatial and channel information for more effective defect feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a novel focal enhanced complete intersection over union (FECIoU) metric with adaptive weights, addressing scale differences and class imbalance by adjusting the weights of hard-to-detect instances through focal loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a 0.8-8.1% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) on the Tianchi dataset and a 1.6-13.2% improvement on our custom dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In industrial settings, weakly supervised (WS) methods are usually preferred over their fully supervised (FS) counterparts as they do not require costly manual annotations. Unfortunately, the segmentation masks obtained in the WS regime are typically poor in terms of accuracy. In this work, we present a WS method capable of producing accurate masks for semantic segmentation in the case of video streams. More specifically, we build saliency maps that exploit the temporal coherence between consecutive frames in a video, promoting consistency when objects appear in different frames. We apply our method in a waste-sorting scenario, where we perform weakly supervised video segmentation (WSVS) by training an auxiliary classifier that distinguishes between videos recorded before and after a human operator, who manually removes specific wastes from a conveyor belt. The saliency maps of this classifier identify materials to be removed, and we modify the classifier training to minimize differences between the saliency map of a central frame and those in adjacent frames, after having compensated object displacement. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the benefits of integrating temporal coherence directly during the training phase of the classifier. Code and dataset are available upon request.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal image fusion synthesizes information from multiple sources into a single image, facilitating downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation. Current approaches primarily focus on acquiring informative fusion images at the visual display stratum through intricate mappings. Although some approaches attempt to jointly optimize image fusion and downstream tasks, these efforts often lack direct guidance or interaction, serving only to assist with a predefined fusion loss. To address this, we propose an ``Unfolding Attribution Analysis Fusion network'' (UAAFusion), using attribution analysis to tailor fused images more effectively for semantic segmentation, enhancing the interaction between the fusion and segmentation. Specifically, we utilize attribution analysis techniques to explore the contributions of semantic regions in the source images to task discrimination. At the same time, our fusion algorithm incorporates more beneficial features from the source images, thereby allowing the segmentation to guide the fusion process. Our method constructs a model-driven unfolding network that uses optimization objectives derived from attribution analysis, with an attribution fusion loss calculated from the current state of the segmentation network. We also develop a new pathway function for attribution analysis, specifically tailored to the fusion tasks in our unfolding network. An attribution attention mechanism is integrated at each network stage, allowing the fusion network to prioritize areas and pixels crucial for high-level recognition tasks. Additionally, to mitigate the information loss in traditional unfolding networks, a memory augmentation module is incorporated into our network to improve the information flow across various network layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in image fusion and applicability to semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: First-break picking is a pivotal procedure in processing microseismic data for geophysics and resource exploration. Recent advancements in deep learning have catalyzed the evolution of automated methods for identifying first-break. Nevertheless, the complexity of seismic data acquisition and the requirement for detailed, expert-driven labeling often result in outliers and potential mislabeling within manually labeled datasets. These issues can negatively affect the training of neural networks, necessitating algorithms that handle outliers or mislabeled data effectively. We introduce the Simultaneous Picking and Refinement (SPR) algorithm, designed to handle datasets plagued by outlier samples or even noisy labels. Unlike conventional approaches that regard manual picks as ground truth, our method treats the true first-break as a latent variable within a probabilistic model that includes a first-break labeling prior. SPR aims to uncover this variable, enabling dynamic adjustments and improved accuracy across the dataset. This strategy mitigates the impact of outliers or inaccuracies in manual labels. Intra-site picking experiments and cross-site generalization experiments on publicly available data confirm our method's performance in identifying first-break and its generalization across different sites. Additionally, our investigations into noisy signals and labels underscore SPR's resilience to both types of noise and its capability to refine misaligned manual annotations. Moreover, the flexibility of SPR, not being limited to any single network architecture, enhances its adaptability across various deep learning-based picking methods. Focusing on learning from data that may contain outliers or partial inaccuracies, SPR provides a robust solution to some of the principal obstacles in automatic first-break picking.

- **Summary**: Image recognition models have struggled to treat recognition robustness to real-world degradations. In this context, data augmentation methods like PixMix improve robustness but rely on generative arts and feature visualizations (FVis), which have copyright, drawing cost, and scalability issues. We propose MoireDB, a formula-generated interference-fringe image dataset for image augmentation enhancing robustness. MoireDB eliminates copyright concerns, reduces dataset assembly costs, and enhances robustness by leveraging illusory patterns. Experiments show that MoireDB augmented images outperforms traditional Fractal arts and FVis-based augmentations, making it a scalable and effective solution for improving model robustness against real-world degradations.

- **Summary**: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis is a challenging task that requires modeling complex interactions between two modalities ( i.e., text and image). A common framework adopted in recent state-of-the-art approaches to achieving such multimodal interactions is to bootstrap the learning process with pre-trained image-aligned text embeddings trained using contrastive loss. Furthermore, these embeddings are typically trained generically and reused across various synthesis models. In contrast, we explore an approach to learning text embeddings specifically tailored to the T2I synthesis network, trained in an end-to-end fashion. Further, we combine generative and contrastive training and use two embeddings, one optimized to enhance the photo-realism of the generated images, and the other seeking to capture text-to-image alignment. A comprehensive set of experiments on three text-to-image benchmark datasets (Oxford-102, Caltech-UCSD, and MS-COCO) reveal that having two separate embeddings gives better results than using a shared one and that such an approach performs favourably in comparison with methods that use text representations from a pre-trained text encoder trained using a discriminative approach. Finally, we demonstrate that such learned embeddings can be used in other contexts as well, such as text-to-image manipulation.

  unpaired deblurring tasks
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Generative diffusion models trained on large-scale datasets have achieved remarkable progress in image synthesis. In favor of their ability to supplement missing details and generate aesthetically pleasing contents, recent works have applied them to image deblurring tasks via training an adapter on blurry-sharp image pairs to provide structural conditions for restoration. However, acquiring substantial amounts of realistic paired data is challenging and costly in real-world scenarios. On the other hand, relying solely on synthetic data often results in overfitting, leading to unsatisfactory performance when confronted with unseen blur patterns. To tackle this issue, we propose BD-Diff, a generative-diffusion-based model designed to enhance deblurring performance on unknown domains by decoupling structural features and blur patterns through joint training on three specially designed tasks. We employ two Q-Formers as structural representations and blur patterns extractors separately. The features extracted by them will be used for the supervised deblurring task on synthetic data and the unsupervised blur-transfer task by leveraging unpaired blurred images from the target domain simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce a reconstruction task to make the structural features and blur patterns complementary. This blur-decoupled learning process enhances the generalization capabilities of BD-Diff when encountering unknown domain blur patterns. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BD-Diff outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in blur removal and structural preservation in various challenging scenarios. The codes will be released in https://github.com/donahowe/BD-Diff

- **Summary**: The integration of vision-language modalities has been a significant focus in multimodal learning, traditionally relying on Vision-Language Pretrained Models. However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a notable shift towards incorporating LLMs with vision modalities. Following this, the training paradigms for incorporating vision modalities into LLMs have evolved. Initially, the approach was to integrate the modalities through pretraining the modality integrator, named Single-stage Tuning. It has since branched out into methods focusing on performance enhancement, denoted as Two-stage Tuning, and those prioritizing parameter efficiency, referred to as Direct Adaptation. However, existing surveys primarily address the latest Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with Two-stage Tuning, leaving a gap in understanding the evolution of training paradigms and their unique parameter-efficient considerations. This paper categorizes and reviews 34 VLLMs from top conferences, journals, and highly cited Arxiv papers, focusing on parameter efficiency during adaptation from the training paradigm perspective. We first introduce the architecture of LLMs and parameter-efficient learning methods, followed by a discussion on vision encoders and a comprehensive taxonomy of modality integrators. We then review three training paradigms and their efficiency considerations, summarizing benchmarks in the VLLM field. To gain deeper insights into their effectiveness in parameter efficiency, we compare and discuss the experimental results of representative models, among which the experiment of the Direct Adaptation paradigm is replicated. Providing insights into recent developments and practical uses, this survey is a vital guide for researchers and practitioners navigating the efficient integration of vision modalities into LLMs.

- **Summary**: Inductive biases are what allow learners to make guesses in the absence of conclusive evidence. These biases have often been studied in cognitive science using concepts or categories -- e.g. by testing how humans generalize a new category from a few examples that leave the category boundary ambiguous. We use these approaches to study generalization in foundation models during in-context learning. Modern foundation models can condition on both vision and text, and differences in how they interpret and learn from these different modalities is an emerging area of study. Here, we study how their generalizations vary by the modality in which stimuli are presented, and the way the stimuli are described in text. We study these biases with three different experimental paradigms, across three different vision-language models. We find that the models generally show some bias towards generalizing according to shape over color. This shape bias tends to be amplified when the examples are presented visually. By contrast, when examples are presented in text, the ordering of adjectives affects generalization. However, the extent of these effects vary across models and paradigms. These results help to reveal how vision-language models represent different types of inputs in context, and may have practical implications for the use of vision-language models.

- **Summary**: Objective: Assessing Alzheimer's disease (AD) using high-dimensional radiology images is clinically important but challenging. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has advanced AD diagnosis, it remains unclear how to design AI models embracing predictability and explainability. Here, we propose VisTA, a multimodal language-vision model assisted by contrastive learning, to optimize disease prediction and evidence-based, interpretable explanations for clinical decision-making.   Methods: We developed VisTA (Vision-Text Alignment Model) for AD diagnosis. Architecturally, we built VisTA from BiomedCLIP and fine-tuned it using contrastive learning to align images with verified abnormalities and their descriptions. To train VisTA, we used a constructed reference dataset containing images, abnormality types, and descriptions verified by medical experts. VisTA produces four outputs: predicted abnormality type, similarity to reference cases, evidence-driven explanation, and final AD diagnoses. To illustrate VisTA's efficacy, we reported accuracy metrics for abnormality retrieval and dementia prediction. To demonstrate VisTA's explainability, we compared its explanations with human experts' explanations.   Results: Compared to 15 million images used for baseline pretraining, VisTA only used 170 samples for fine-tuning and obtained significant improvement in abnormality retrieval and dementia prediction. For abnormality retrieval, VisTA reached 74% accuracy and an AUC of 0.87 (26% and 0.74, respectively, from baseline models). For dementia prediction, VisTA achieved 88% accuracy and an AUC of 0.82 (30% and 0.57, respectively, from baseline models). The generated explanations agreed strongly with human experts' and provided insights into the diagnostic process. Taken together, VisTA optimize prediction, clinical reasoning, and explanation.

- **Summary**: Recent success in legged robot locomotion is attributed to the integration of reinforcement learning and physical simulators. However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.

- **Summary**: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) combines lip-based video with audio and can improve performance in noise, but most methods are trained only on English data. One limitation is the lack of large-scale multilingual video data, which makes it hard hard to train models from scratch. In this work, we propose mWhisper-Flamingo for multilingual AVSR which combines the strengths of a pre-trained audio model (Whisper) and video model (AV-HuBERT). To enable better multi-modal integration and improve the noisy multilingual performance, we introduce decoder modality dropout where the model is trained both on paired audio-visual inputs and separate audio/visual inputs. mWhisper-Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art WER on MuAViC, an AVSR dataset of 9 languages. Audio-visual mWhisper-Flamingo consistently outperforms audio-only Whisper on all languages in noisy conditions.

- **Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) through external knowledge integration, yet its application has primarily focused on textual content, leaving the rich domain of multi-modal video knowledge predominantly unexplored. This paper introduces VideoRAG, the first retrieval-augmented generation framework specifically designed for processing and understanding extremely long-context videos. Our core innovation lies in its dual-channel architecture that seamlessly integrates (i) graph-based textual knowledge grounding for capturing cross-video semantic relationships, and (ii) multi-modal context encoding for efficiently preserving visual features. This novel design empowers VideoRAG to process unlimited-length videos by constructing precise knowledge graphs that span multiple videos while maintaining semantic dependencies through specialized multi-modal retrieval paradigms. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on our proposed LongerVideos benchmark-comprising over 160 videos totaling 134+ hours across lecture, documentary, and entertainment categories-VideoRAG demonstrates substantial performance compared to existing RAG alternatives and long video understanding methods. The source code of VideoRAG implementation and the benchmark dataset are openly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/VideoRAG.

- **Summary**: With climate change expected to exacerbate fire weather conditions, the accurate and timely anticipation of wildfires becomes increasingly crucial for disaster mitigation. In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we present FireCastNet, a novel architecture which combines a 3D convolutional encoder with GraphCast, originally developed for global short-term weather forecasting using graph neural networks. FireCastNet is trained to capture the context leading to wildfires, at different spatial and temporal scales. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of our model in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.

- **Summary**: Oriented Object Detection (OOD) has received increased attention in the past years, being a suitable solution for detecting elongated objects in remote sensing analysis. In particular, using regression loss functions based on Gaussian distributions has become attractive since they yield simple and differentiable terms. However, existing solutions are still based on regression heads that produce Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBBs), and the known problem of angular boundary discontinuity persists. In this work, we propose a regression head for OOD that directly produces Gaussian distributions based on the Cholesky matrix decomposition. The proposed head, named GauCho, theoretically mitigates the boundary discontinuity problem and is fully compatible with recent Gaussian-based regression loss functions. Furthermore, we advocate using Oriented Ellipses (OEs) to represent oriented objects, which relates to GauCho through a bijective function and alleviates the encoding ambiguity problem for circular objects. Our experimental results show that GauCho can be a viable alternative to the traditional OBB head, achieving results comparable to or better than state-of-the-art detectors for the challenging dataset DOTA

- **Summary**: A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to create complex artifacts through structured multi-step processes. Generating procedural tutorials with AI is a longstanding but challenging goal, facing three key obstacles: (1) scarcity of multi-task procedural datasets, (2) maintaining logical continuity and visual consistency between steps, and (3) generalizing across multiple domains. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-domain dataset covering 21 tasks with over 24,000 procedural sequences. Building upon this foundation, we introduce MakeAnything, a framework based on the diffusion transformer (DIT), which leverages fine-tuning to activate the in-context capabilities of DIT for generating consistent procedural sequences. We introduce asymmetric low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for image generation, which balances generalization capabilities and task-specific performance by freezing encoder parameters while adaptively tuning decoder layers. Additionally, our ReCraft model enables image-to-process generation through spatiotemporal consistency constraints, allowing static images to be decomposed into plausible creation sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MakeAnything surpasses existing methods, setting new performance benchmarks for procedural generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks but remain vulnerable to visual adversarial perturbations that can induce hallucinations, manipulate responses, or bypass safety mechanisms. Existing methods seek to mitigate these risks by applying constrained adversarial fine-tuning to CLIP vision encoders on ImageNet-scale data, ensuring their generalization ability is preserved. However, this limited adversarial training restricts robustness and broader generalization. In this work, we explore an alternative approach of leveraging existing vision classification models that have been adversarially pre-trained on large-scale data. Our analysis reveals two principal contributions: (1) the extensive scale and diversity of adversarial pre-training enables these models to demonstrate superior robustness against diverse adversarial threats, ranging from imperceptible perturbations to advanced jailbreaking attempts, without requiring additional adversarial training, and (2) end-to-end MLLM integration with these robust models facilitates enhanced adaptation of language components to robust visual features, outperforming existing plug-and-play methodologies on complex reasoning tasks. Through systematic evaluation across visual question-answering, image captioning, and jail-break attacks, we demonstrate that MLLMs trained with these robust models achieve superior adversarial robustness while maintaining favorable clean performance. Our framework achieves 2x and 1.5x average robustness gains in captioning and VQA tasks, respectively, and delivers over 10% improvement against jailbreak attacks.

- **Summary**: The garment-to-person virtual try-on (VTON) task, which aims to generate fitting images of a person wearing a reference garment, has made significant strides. However, obtaining a standard garment is often more challenging than using the garment already worn by the person. To improve ease of use, we propose MFP-VTON, a Mask-Free framework for Person-to-Person VTON. Recognizing the scarcity of person-to-person data, we adapt a garment-to-person model and dataset to construct a specialized dataset for this task. Our approach builds upon a pretrained diffusion transformer, leveraging its strong generative capabilities. During mask-free model fine-tuning, we introduce a Focus Attention loss to emphasize the garment of the reference person and the details outside the garment of the target person. Experimental results demonstrate that our model excels in both person-to-person and garment-to-person VTON tasks, generating high-fidelity fitting images.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in video generation have significantly improved the ability to synthesize videos from text instructions. However, existing models still struggle with key challenges such as instruction misalignment, content hallucination, safety concerns, and bias. Addressing these limitations, we introduce MJ-BENCH-VIDEO, a large-scale video preference benchmark designed to evaluate video generation across five critical aspects: Alignment, Safety, Fineness, Coherence & Consistency, and Bias & Fairness. This benchmark incorporates 28 fine-grained criteria to provide a comprehensive evaluation of video preference. Building upon this dataset, we propose MJ-VIDEO, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based video reward model designed to deliver fine-grained reward. MJ-VIDEO can dynamically select relevant experts to accurately judge the preference based on the input text-video pair. This architecture enables more precise and adaptable preference judgments. Through extensive benchmarking on MJ-BENCH-VIDEO, we analyze the limitations of existing video reward models and demonstrate the superior performance of MJ-VIDEO in video preference assessment, achieving 17.58% and 15.87% improvements in overall and fine-grained preference judgments, respectively. Additionally, introducing MJ-VIDEO for preference tuning in video generation enhances the alignment performance.

- **Summary**: Customization of text-to-image models enables users to insert custom concepts and generate the concepts in unseen settings. Existing methods either rely on costly test-time optimization or train encoders on single-image training datasets without multi-image supervision, leading to worse image quality. We propose a simple approach that addresses both limitations. We first leverage existing text-to-image models and 3D datasets to create a high-quality Synthetic Customization Dataset (SynCD) consisting of multiple images of the same object in different lighting, backgrounds, and poses. We then propose a new encoder architecture based on shared attention mechanisms that better incorporate fine-grained visual details from input images. Finally, we propose a new inference technique that mitigates overexposure issues during inference by normalizing the text and image guidance vectors. Through extensive experiments, we show that our model, trained on the synthetic dataset with the proposed encoder and inference algorithm, outperforms existing tuning-free methods on standard customization benchmarks.

- **Summary**: We present SliderSpace, a framework for automatically decomposing the visual capabilities of diffusion models into controllable and human-understandable directions. Unlike existing control methods that require a user to specify attributes for each edit direction individually, SliderSpace discovers multiple interpretable and diverse directions simultaneously from a single text prompt. Each direction is trained as a low-rank adaptor, enabling compositional control and the discovery of surprising possibilities in the model's latent space. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art diffusion models, we demonstrate SliderSpace's effectiveness across three applications: concept decomposition, artistic style exploration, and diversity enhancement. Our quantitative evaluation shows that SliderSpace-discovered directions decompose the visual structure of model's knowledge effectively, offering insights into the latent capabilities encoded within diffusion models. User studies further validate that our method produces more diverse and useful variations compared to baselines. Our code, data and trained weights are available at https://sliderspace.baulab.info

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Keyframe Imitation Learning (IL) have enabled learning-based agents to solve a diverse range of manipulation tasks. However, most approaches ignore the rich symmetries in the problem setting and, as a consequence, are sample-inefficient. This work identifies and utilizes the bi-equivariant symmetry within Keyframe IL to design a policy that generalizes to transformations of both the workspace and the objects grasped by the gripper. We make two main contributions: First, we analyze the bi-equivariance properties of the keyframe action scheme and propose a Keyframe Transporter derived from the Transporter Networks, which evaluates actions using cross-correlation between the features of the grasped object and the features of the scene. Second, we propose a computationally efficient coarse-to-fine SE(3) action evaluation scheme for reasoning the intertwined translation and rotation action. The resulting method outperforms strong Keyframe IL baselines by an average of >10% on a wide range of simulation tasks, and by an average of 55% in 4 physical experiments.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) dominate video generation but their high computational cost severely limits real-world applicability, usually requiring tens of minutes to generate a few seconds of video even on high-performance GPUs. This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.

- **Summary**: In the era of generative AI, integrating video generation models into robotics opens new possibilities for the general-purpose robot agent. This paper introduces imitation learning with latent video planning (VILP). We propose a latent video diffusion model to generate predictive robot videos that adhere to temporal consistency to a good degree. Our method is able to generate highly time-aligned videos from multiple views, which is crucial for robot policy learning. Our video generation model is highly time-efficient. For example, it can generate videos from two distinct perspectives, each consisting of six frames with a resolution of 96x160 pixels, at a rate of 5 Hz. In the experiments, we demonstrate that VILP outperforms the existing video generation robot policy across several metrics: training costs, inference speed, temporal consistency of generated videos, and the performance of the policy. We also compared our method with other imitation learning methods. Our findings indicate that VILP can rely less on extensive high-quality task-specific robot action data while still maintaining robust performance. In addition, VILP possesses robust capabilities in representing multi-modal action distributions. Our paper provides a practical example of how to effectively integrate video generation models into robot policies, potentially offering insights for related fields and directions.

- **Summary**: The preservation of aquatic biodiversity is critical in mitigating the effects of climate change. Aquatic scene understanding plays a pivotal role in aiding marine scientists in their decision-making processes. In this paper, we introduce AquaticCLIP, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training model tailored for aquatic scene understanding. AquaticCLIP presents a new unsupervised learning framework that aligns images and texts in aquatic environments, enabling tasks such as segmentation, classification, detection, and object counting. By leveraging our large-scale underwater image-text paired dataset without the need for ground-truth annotations, our model enriches existing vision-language models in the aquatic domain. For this purpose, we construct a 2 million underwater image-text paired dataset using heterogeneous resources, including YouTube, Netflix, NatGeo, etc. To fine-tune AquaticCLIP, we propose a prompt-guided vision encoder that progressively aggregates patch features via learnable prompts, while a vision-guided mechanism enhances the language encoder by incorporating visual context. The model is optimized through a contrastive pretraining loss to align visual and textual modalities. AquaticCLIP achieves notable performance improvements in zero-shot settings across multiple underwater computer vision tasks, outperforming existing methods in both robustness and interpretability. Our model sets a new benchmark for vision-language applications in underwater environments. The code and dataset for AquaticCLIP are publicly available on GitHub at xxx.

- **Summary**: Ubiquitous geometric objects can be precisely and efficiently represented as polyhedra. The transformation of a polyhedron into a vector, known as polyhedra representation learning, is crucial for manipulating these shapes with mathematical and statistical tools for tasks like classification, clustering, and generation. Recent years have witnessed significant strides in this domain, yet most efforts focus on the vertex sequence of a polyhedron, neglecting the complex surface modeling crucial in real-world polyhedral objects. This study proposes \textbf{PolyhedronNet}, a general framework tailored for learning representations of 3D polyhedral objects. We propose the concept of the surface-attributed graph to seamlessly model the vertices, edges, faces, and their geometric interrelationships within a polyhedron. To effectively learn the representation of the entire surface-attributed graph, we first propose to break it down into local rigid representations to effectively learn each local region's relative positions against the remaining regions without geometric information loss. Subsequently, we propose PolyhedronGNN to hierarchically aggregate the local rigid representation via intra-face and inter-face geometric message passing modules, to obtain a global representation that minimizes information loss while maintaining rotation and translation invariance. Our experimental evaluations on four distinct datasets, encompassing both classification and retrieval tasks, substantiate PolyhedronNet's efficacy in capturing comprehensive and informative representations of 3D polyhedral objects.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based video super-resolution (VSR) models have set new benchmarks in recent years, but their substantial computational demands make most of them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Achieving a balance between model complexity and output quality remains a formidable challenge in VSR. Although lightweight models have been introduced to address this issue, they often struggle to deliver state-of-the-art performance. We propose a novel lightweight, parameter-efficient deep residual deformable convolution network for VSR. Unlike prior methods, our model enhances feature utilization through residual connections and employs deformable convolution for precise frame alignment, addressing motion dynamics effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a single memory tensor to capture information accrued from the past frames and improve motion estimation across frames. This design enables an efficient balance between computational cost and reconstruction quality. With just 2.3 million parameters, our model achieves state-of-the-art SSIM of 0.9175 on the REDS4 dataset, surpassing existing lightweight and many heavy models in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Architectural insights from our model pave the way for real-time VSR on streaming data.

- **Summary**: Texture synthesis is a fundamental task in computer vision, whose goal is to generate visually realistic and structurally coherent textures for a wide range of applications, from graphics to scientific simulations. While traditional methods like tiling and patch-based techniques often struggle with complex textures, recent advancements in deep learning have transformed this field. In this paper, we propose ViT-SGAN, a new hybrid model that fuses Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a Spatial Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) to address the limitations of previous methods. By incorporating specialized texture descriptors such as mean-variance (mu, sigma) and textons into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, our model achieves superior texture synthesis. This approach enhances the model's capacity to capture complex spatial dependencies, leading to improved texture quality that is superior to state-of-the-art models, especially for regular and irregular textures. Comparison experiments with metrics such as FID, IS, SSIM, and LPIPS demonstrate the substantial improvement of ViT-SGAN, which underlines its efficiency in generating diverse realistic textures.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated superior quality in modeling 3D objects and scenes. However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.

- **Summary**: Harvesting is a critical task in the tree fruit industry, demanding extensive manual labor and substantial costs, and exposing workers to potential hazards. Recent advances in automated harvesting offer a promising solution by enabling efficient, cost-effective, and ergonomic fruit picking within tight harvesting windows. However, existing harvesting technologies often indiscriminately harvest all visible and accessible fruits, including those that are unripe or undersized. This study introduces a novel foundation model-based framework for efficient apple ripeness and size estimation. Specifically, we curated two public RGBD-based Fuji apple image datasets, integrating expanded annotations for ripeness ("Ripe" vs. "Unripe") based on fruit color and image capture dates. The resulting comprehensive dataset, Fuji-Ripeness-Size Dataset, includes 4,027 images and 16,257 annotated apples with ripeness and size labels. Using Grounding-DINO, a language-model-based object detector, we achieved robust apple detection and ripeness classification, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we developed and evaluated six size estimation algorithms, selecting the one with the lowest error and variation for optimal performance. The Fuji-Ripeness-Size Dataset and the apple detection and size estimation algorithms are made publicly available, which provides valuable benchmarks for future studies in automated and selective harvesting.

- **Summary**: The abstraction of 3D objects with simple geometric primitives like cuboids allows to infer structural information from complex geometry. It is important for 3D shape understanding, structural analysis and geometric modeling. We introduce a novel fine-to-coarse unsupervised learning approach to abstract collections of 3D shapes. Our architectural design allows us to reduce the number of primitives from hundreds (fine reconstruction) to only a few (coarse abstraction) during training. This allows our network to optimize the reconstruction error and adhere to a user-specified number of primitives per shape while simultaneously learning a consistent structure across the whole collection of data. We achieve this through our abstraction loss formulation which increasingly penalizes redundant primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a reconstruction loss formulation to account not only for surface approximation but also volume preservation. Combining both contributions allows us to represent 3D shapes more precisely with fewer cuboid primitives than previous work. We evaluate our method on collections of man-made and humanoid shapes comparing with previous state-of-the-art learning methods on commonly used benchmarks. Our results confirm an improvement over previous cuboid-based shape abstraction techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrate our cuboid abstraction in downstream tasks like clustering, retrieval, and partial symmetry detection.

- **Summary**: Accurate and robust 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving, where fusing data from sensors like LiDAR and camera enhances detection accuracy. However, sensor malfunctions such as corruption or disconnection can degrade performance, and existing fusion models often struggle to maintain reliability when one modality fails. To address this, we propose ReliFusion, a novel LiDAR-camera fusion framework operating in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space. ReliFusion integrates three key components: the Spatio-Temporal Feature Aggregation (STFA) module, which captures dependencies across frames to stabilize predictions over time; the Reliability module, which assigns confidence scores to quantify the dependability of each modality under challenging conditions; and the Confidence-Weighted Mutual Cross-Attention (CW-MCA) module, which dynamically balances information from LiDAR and camera modalities based on these confidence scores. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ReliFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior robustness and accuracy in scenarios with limited LiDAR fields of view and severe sensor malfunctions.

- **Summary**: Previous work in aesthetic categorization and explainability utilizes manual labeling and classification to explain aesthetic scores. These methods require a complex labeling process and are limited in size. Our proposed approach attempts to explain aesthetic assessment models through visualizing dataset trends and automatic categorization of visual aesthetic features through training neural networks on different versions of the same dataset. By evaluating the models adapted to each specific modality using existing and novel metrics, we can capture and visualize aesthetic features and trends.

- **Summary**: 3D cellular image segmentation methods are commonly divided into non-2D-based and 2D-based approaches, the latter reconstructing 3D shapes from the segmentation results of 2D layers. However, errors in 2D results often propagate, leading to oversegmentations in the final 3D results. To tackle this issue, we introduce an interpretable geometric framework that addresses the oversegmentations by correcting the 2D segmentation results based on geometric information from adjacent layers. Leveraging both geometric (layer-to-layer, 2D) and topological (3D shape) features, we use binary classification to determine whether neighboring cells should be stitched. We develop a pre-trained classifier on public plant cell datasets and validate its performance on animal cell datasets, confirming its effectiveness in correcting oversegmentations under the transfer learning setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our framework can be extended to correcting oversegmentation on non-2D-based methods. A clear pipeline is provided for end-users to build the pre-trained model to any labeled dataset.
