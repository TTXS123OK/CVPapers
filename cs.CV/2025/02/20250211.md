- **Summary**: Social media platforms enable the propagation of hateful content across different modalities such as textual, auditory, and visual, necessitating effective detection methods. While recent approaches have shown promise in handling individual modalities, their effectiveness across different modality combinations remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis of fusion-based approaches for multimodal hate detection, focusing on their performance across video and image-based content. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals significant modality-specific limitations: while simple embedding fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on video content (HateMM dataset) with a 9.9% points F1-score improvement, it struggles with complex image-text relationships in memes (Hateful Memes dataset). Through detailed ablation studies and error analysis, we demonstrate how current fusion approaches fail to capture nuanced cross-modal interactions, particularly in cases involving benign confounders. Our findings provide crucial insights for developing more robust hate detection systems and highlight the need for modality-specific architectural considerations.

- **Summary**: We present a method for recovering the shape and radiance of a scene consisting of multiple people given solely a few images. Multi-human scenes are complex due to additional occlusion and clutter. For single-human settings, existing approaches using implicit neural representations have achieved impressive results that deliver accurate geometry and appearance. However, it remains challenging to extend these methods for estimating multiple humans from sparse views. We propose a neural implicit reconstruction method that addresses the inherent challenges of this task through the following contributions: First, we propose to use geometry constraints by exploiting pre-computed meshes using a human body model (SMPL). Specifically, we regularize the signed distances using the SMPL mesh and leverage bounding boxes for improved rendering. Second, we propose a ray regularization scheme to minimize rendering inconsistencies, and a saturation regularization for robust optimization in variable illumination. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the benefits of our approach and show state-of-the-art performance against existing neural reconstruction methods.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong performance in aligning visual and textual representations, excelling in tasks like image retrieval and zero-shot classification. Despite this success, the mechanisms by which these models utilize training data, particularly the role of memorization, remain unclear. In uni-modal models, both supervised and self-supervised, memorization has been shown to be essential for generalization. However, it is not well understood how these findings would apply to CLIP, which incorporates elements from both supervised learning via captions that provide a supervisory signal similar to labels, and from self-supervised learning via the contrastive objective. To bridge this gap in understanding, we propose a formal definition of memorization in CLIP (CLIPMem) and use it to quantify memorization in CLIP models. Our results indicate that CLIP's memorization behavior falls between the supervised and self-supervised paradigms, with "mis-captioned" samples exhibiting highest levels of memorization. Additionally, we find that the text encoder contributes more to memorization than the image encoder, suggesting that mitigation strategies should focus on the text domain. Building on these insights, we propose multiple strategies to reduce memorization while at the same time improving utility--something that had not been shown before for traditional learning paradigms where reducing memorization typically results in utility decrease.

- **Summary**: Anatomy evaluation is crucial for understanding the physiological state, diagnosing abnormalities, and guiding medical interventions. Statistical shape modeling (SSM) is vital in this process. By enabling the extraction of quantitative morphological shape descriptors from MRI and CT scans, SSM provides comprehensive descriptions of anatomical variations within a population. However, the effectiveness of SSM in anatomy evaluation hinges on the quality and robustness of the shape models. While deep learning techniques show promise in addressing these challenges by learning complex nonlinear representations of shapes, existing models still have limitations and often require pre-established shape models for training. To overcome these issues, we propose Mesh2SSM++, a novel approach that learns to estimate correspondences from meshes in an unsupervised manner. This method leverages unsupervised, permutation-invariant representation learning to estimate how to deform a template point cloud into subject-specific meshes, forming a correspondence-based shape model. Additionally, our probabilistic formulation allows learning a population-specific template, reducing potential biases associated with template selection. A key feature of Mesh2SSM++ is its ability to quantify aleatoric uncertainty, which captures inherent data variability and is essential for ensuring reliable model predictions and robust decision-making in clinical tasks, especially under challenging imaging conditions. Through extensive validation across diverse anatomies, evaluation metrics, and downstream tasks, we demonstrate that Mesh2SSM++ outperforms existing methods. Its ability to operate directly on meshes, combined with computational efficiency and interpretability through its probabilistic framework, makes it an attractive alternative to traditional and deep learning-based SSM approaches.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Counterfactual explanations in medical imaging are critical for understanding the predictions made by deep learning models. We extend the Latent Shift counterfactual generation method from 2D applications to 3D computed tomography (CT) scans. We address the challenges associated with 3D data, such as limited training samples and high memory demands, by implementing a slice-based approach. This method leverages a 2D encoder trained on CT slices, which are subsequently combined to maintain 3D context. We demonstrate this technique on two models for clinical phenotype prediction and lung segmentation. Our approach is both memory-efficient and effective for generating interpretable counterfactuals in high-resolution 3D medical imaging.



### HDCompression: Hybrid-Diffusion Image Compression for Ultra-Low Bitrates

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Image compression under ultra-low bitrates remains challenging for both conventional learned image compression (LIC) and generative vector-quantized (VQ) modeling. Conventional LIC suffers from severe artifacts due to heavy quantization, while generative VQ modeling gives poor fidelity due to the mismatch between learned generative priors and specific inputs. In this work, we propose Hybrid-Diffusion Image Compression (HDCompression), a dual-stream framework that utilizes both generative VQ-modeling and diffusion models, as well as conventional LIC, to achieve both high fidelity and high perceptual quality. Different from previous hybrid methods that directly use pre-trained LIC models to generate low-quality fidelity-preserving information from heavily quantized latent, we use diffusion models to extract high-quality complimentary fidelity information from the ground-truth input, which can enhance the system performance in several aspects: improving indices map prediction, enhancing the fidelity-preserving output of the LIC stream, and refining conditioned image reconstruction with VQ-latent correction. In addition, our diffusion model is based on a dense representative vector (DRV), which is lightweight with very simple sampling schedulers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HDCompression outperforms the previous conventional LIC, generative VQ-modeling, and hybrid frameworks in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualization, providing balanced robust compression performance at ultra-low bitrates.

- **Summary**: Transformers have become foundational for visual tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and video understanding, but their quadratic complexity in attention mechanisms presents scalability challenges. To address these limitations, the Mamba architecture utilizes state-space models (SSMs) for linear scalability, efficient processing, and improved contextual awareness. This paper investigates Mamba architecture for visual domain applications and its recent advancements, including Vision Mamba (ViM) and VideoMamba, which introduce bidirectional scanning, selective scanning mechanisms, and spatiotemporal processing to enhance image and video understanding. Architectural innovations like position embeddings, cross-scan modules, and hierarchical designs further optimize the Mamba framework for global and local feature extraction. These advancements position Mamba as a promising architecture in computer vision research and applications.

- **Summary**: In recent years, deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has achieved remarkable results in the field of HMER (Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition). However, it remains challenging to improve performance with limited labeled training data. This paper presents, for the first time, a simple yet effective semi-supervised HMER framework by introducing dual-branch semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we simplify the conventional deep co-training from consistency regularization to cross-supervised learning, where the prediction of one branch is used as a pseudo-label to supervise the other branch directly end-to-end. Considering that the learning of the two branches tends to converge in the later stages of model optimization, we also incorporate a weak-to-strong strategy by applying different levels of augmentation to each branch, which behaves like expanding the training data and improving the quality of network training. Meanwhile, We propose a novel module, Global Dynamic Counting Module(GDCM), to enhance the performance of the HMER decoder, which alleviates recognition inaccuracies in long-distance formula recognition and the occurrence of repeated characters. We release our code at https://github.com/chenkehua/SemiHMER.

- **Summary**: The safe operation of high-voltage transmission lines ensures the power grid's security. Various foreign objects attached to the transmission lines, such as balloons, kites and nesting birds, can significantly affect the safe and stable operation of high-voltage transmission lines. With the advancement of computer vision technology, periodic automatic inspection of foreign objects is efficient and necessary. Existing detection methods have low accuracy because foreign objects at-tached to the transmission lines are complex, including occlusions, diverse object types, significant scale variations, and complex backgrounds. In response to the practical needs of the Yunnan Branch of China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd., this paper proposes an improved YOLOv8m-based model for detecting foreign objects on transmission lines. Experiments are conducted on a dataset collected from Yunnan Power Grid. The proposed model enhances the original YOLOv8m by in-corporating a Global Attention Module (GAM) into the backbone to focus on occluded foreign objects, replacing the SPPF module with the SPPCSPC module to augment the model's multiscale feature extraction capability, and introducing the Focal-EIoU loss function to address the issue of high- and low-quality sample imbalances. These improvements accelerate model convergence and enhance detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves a 2.7% increase in mAP_0.5, a 4% increase in mAP_0.5:0.95, and a 6% increase in recall.

- **Summary**: Insulators are crucial insulation components and structural supports in power grids, playing a vital role in the transmission lines. Due to temperature fluctuations, internal stress, or damage from hail, insulators are prone to injury. Automatic detection of damaged insulators faces challenges such as diverse types, small defect targets, and complex backgrounds and shapes. Most research for detecting insulator defects has focused on a single defect type or a specific material. However, the insulators in the grid's transmission lines have different colors and materials. Various insulator defects coexist, and the existing methods have difficulty meeting the practical application requirements. Current methods suffer from low detection accuracy and mAP0.5 cannot meet application requirements. This paper proposes an improved YOLOv7 model for multi-type insulator defect detection. First, our model replaces the SPPCSPC module with the RFB module to enhance the network's feature extraction capability. Second, a CA mechanism is introduced into the head part to enhance the network's feature representation ability and to improve detection accuracy. Third, a WIoU loss function is employed to address the low-quality samples hindering model generalization during training, thereby improving the model's overall performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model exhibits enhancements across various performance metrics. Specifically, there is a 1.6% advancement in mAP_0.5, a corresponding 1.6% enhancement in mAP_0.5:0.95, a 1.3% elevation in precision, and a 1% increase in recall. Moreover, the model achieves parameter reduction by 3.2 million, leading to a decrease of 2.5 GFLOPS in computational cost. Notably, there is also an improvement of 2.81 milliseconds in single-image detection speed.

- **Summary**: This research addresses the challenge of limited data in tabular data classification, particularly prevalent in domains with constraints like healthcare. We propose Tab2Visual, a novel approach that transforms heterogeneous tabular data into visual representations, enabling the application of powerful deep learning models. Tab2Visual effectively addresses data scarcity by incorporating novel image augmentation techniques and facilitating transfer learning. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach on diverse tabular datasets, comparing its performance against a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including classical methods, tree-based ensembles, and state-of-the-art deep learning models specifically designed for tabular data. We also perform an in-depth analysis of factors influencing Tab2Visual's performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that Tab2Visual outperforms other methods in classification problems with limited tabular data.

- **Summary**: Guide dog robots offer promising solutions to enhance mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals, addressing the limitations of traditional guide dogs, particularly in perceptual intelligence and communication. With the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), robots are now capable of generating natural language descriptions of their surroundings, aiding in safer decision-making. However, existing VLMs often struggle to accurately interpret and convey spatial relationships, which is crucial for navigation in complex environments such as street crossings. We introduce the Space-Aware Instruction Tuning (SAIT) dataset and the Space-Aware Benchmark (SA-Bench) to address the limitations of current VLMs in understanding physical environments. Our automated data generation pipeline focuses on the virtual path to the destination in 3D space and the surroundings, enhancing environmental comprehension and enabling VLMs to provide more accurate guidance to visually impaired individuals. We also propose an evaluation protocol to assess VLM effectiveness in delivering walking guidance. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our space-aware instruction-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We have fully open-sourced the SAIT dataset and SA-Bench, along with the related code, at https://github.com/byungokhan/Space-awareVLM

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V and Llama 3.2 vision, have garnered significant research attention for their ability to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks. However, their potential is constrained by inherent challenges, including proprietary restrictions, substantial computational demands, and limited accessibility. Smaller models, such as GIT and BLIP, exhibit marked limitations, often failing to generate coherent and consistent text beyond a few tokens, even with extensive training. This underscores a pivotal inquiry: how small can a VLM be and still produce fluent and consistent text? Drawing inspiration from the exceptional learning process of 3-4 year old children, who rely heavily on visual cues for understanding and communication, we introduce two novel datasets: ShortDesc (featuring concise image descriptions) and LongDesc (containing more detailed image descriptions). These datasets consist of image-text pairs where the text is restricted to the simple vocabulary and syntax typically used by young children, generated with a scaled- down model, GPT-4o. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that it is possible to train VLMs that are significantly smaller, up to 10 times smaller than state of the art(SOTA) small VLMs while maintaining architectural simplicity. To evaluate the outputs, we leverage GPT-4o to grade the text, as if stories written by students, on creativity, meaningfulness, and consistency, assigning scores out of 10. This method addresses limitations of standard benchmarks by accommodating unstructured outputs and providing a multidimensional evaluation of the model capabilities. Our findings contribute to the development of lightweight, accessible multimodal models for resource constrained environments.

- **Summary**: Machine learning and AI have achieved remarkable advancements but at the cost of significant computational resources and energy consumption. This has created an urgent need for a novel, energy-efficient computational fabric to replace the current computing pipeline. Recently, a promising approach has emerged by mimicking spiking neurons in the brain and leveraging oscillators on CMOS for direct computation. In this context, we propose a new and energy efficient machine learning framework implemented on CMOS Oscillator Networks (OscNet). We model the developmental processes of the prenatal brain's visual system using OscNet, updating weights based on the biologically inspired Hebbian rule. This same pipeline is then directly applied to standard machine learning tasks. OscNet is a specially designed hardware and is inherently energy-efficient. Its reliance on forward propagation alone for training further enhances its energy efficiency while maintaining biological plausibility. Simulation validates our designs of OscNet architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that Hebbian learning pipeline on OscNet achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing traditional machine learning algorithms, highlighting its potential as a energy efficient and effective computational paradigm.



### Dense Object Detection Based on De-homogenized Queries

- **Summary**: Dense object detection is widely used in automatic driving, video surveillance, and other fields. This paper focuses on the challenging task of dense object detection. Currently, detection methods based on greedy algorithms, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS), often produce many repetitive predictions or missed detections in dense scenarios, which is a common problem faced by NMS-based algorithms. Through the end-to-end DETR (DEtection TRansformer), as a type of detector that can incorporate the post-processing de-duplication capability of NMS, etc., into the network, we found that homogeneous queries in the query-based detector lead to a reduction in the de-duplication capability of the network and the learning efficiency of the encoder, resulting in duplicate prediction and missed detection problems. To solve this problem, we propose learnable differentiated encoding to de-homogenize the queries, and at the same time, queries can communicate with each other via differentiated encoding information, replacing the previous self-attention among the queries. In addition, we used joint loss on the output of the encoder that considered both location and confidence prediction to give a higher-quality initialization for queries. Without cumbersome decoder stacking and guaranteeing accuracy, our proposed end-to-end detection framework was more concise and reduced the number of parameters by about 8% compared to deformable DETR. Our method achieved excellent results on the challenging CrowdHuman dataset with 93.6% average precision (AP), 39.2% MR-2, and 84.3% JI. The performance overperformed previous SOTA methods, such as Iter-E2EDet (Progressive End-to-End Object Detection) and MIP (One proposal, Multiple predictions). In addition, our method is more robust in various scenarios with different densities.

- **Summary**: Single-source domain generalization (SDG) in medical image segmentation remains a significant challenge, particularly for images with varying color distributions and qualities. Previous approaches often struggle when models trained on high-quality images fail to generalize to low-quality test images due to these color and quality shifts. In this work, we propose two novel techniques to enhance generalization: dynamic color image normalization (DCIN) module and color-quality generalization (CQG) loss. The DCIN dynamically normalizes the color of test images using two reference image selection strategies. Specifically, the DCIN utilizes a global reference image selection (GRIS), which finds a universal reference image, and a local reference image selection (LRIS), which selects a semantically similar reference image per test sample. Additionally, CQG loss enforces invariance to color and quality variations by ensuring consistent segmentation predictions across transformed image pairs. Experimental results show that our proposals significantly improve segmentation performance over the baseline on two target domain datasets, despite being trained solely on a single source domain. Notably, our model achieved up to a 32.3-point increase in Dice score compared to the baseline, consistently producing robust and usable results even under substantial domain shifts. Our work contributes to the development of more robust medical image segmentation models that generalize across unseen domains. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/RaviShah1/DCIN-CQG.

- **Summary**: Recent diffusion-based talking face generation models have demonstrated impressive potential in synthesizing videos that accurately match a speech audio clip with a given reference identity. However, existing approaches still encounter significant challenges due to uncontrollable factors, such as inaccurate lip-sync, inappropriate head posture and the lack of fine-grained control over facial expressions. In order to introduce more face-guided conditions beyond speech audio clips, a novel two-stage training framework Playmate is proposed to generate more lifelike facial expressions and talking faces. In the first stage, we introduce a decoupled implicit 3D representation along with a meticulously designed motion-decoupled module to facilitate more accurate attribute disentanglement and generate expressive talking videos directly from audio cues. Then, in the second stage, we introduce an emotion-control module to encode emotion control information into the latent space, enabling fine-grained control over emotions and thereby achieving the ability to generate talking videos with desired emotion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Playmate outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of video quality and lip-synchronization, and improves flexibility in controlling emotion and head pose.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR) enables image search using a reference image and text prompt without requiring specialized text-image composition networks trained on large-scale paired data. However, current ZS-CIR approaches face three critical limitations in their reliance on composed text embeddings: static query embedding representations, insufficient utilization of image embeddings, and suboptimal performance when fusing text and image embeddings. To address these challenges, we introduce the Prompt Directional Vector (PDV), a simple yet effective training-free enhancement that captures semantic modifications induced by user prompts. PDV enables three key improvements: (1) dynamic composed text embeddings where prompt adjustments are controllable via a scaling factor, (2) composed image embeddings through semantic transfer from text prompts to image features, and (3) weighted fusion of composed text and image embeddings that enhances retrieval by balancing visual and semantic similarity. Our approach serves as a plug-and-play enhancement for existing ZS-CIR methods with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PDV consistently improves retrieval performance when integrated with state-of-the-art ZS-CIR approaches, particularly for methods that generate accurate compositional embeddings. The code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recent years have seen an increase in the use of gigapixel-level image and video capture systems and benchmarks with high-resolution wide (HRW) shots. However, unlike close-up shots in the MS COCO dataset, the higher resolution and wider field of view raise unique challenges, such as extreme sparsity and huge scale changes, causing existing close-up detectors inaccuracy and inefficiency. In this paper, we present a novel model-agnostic sparse vision transformer, dubbed SparseFormer, to bridge the gap of object detection between close-up and HRW shots. The proposed SparseFormer selectively uses attentive tokens to scrutinize the sparsely distributed windows that may contain objects. In this way, it can jointly explore global and local attention by fusing coarse- and fine-grained features to handle huge scale changes. SparseFormer also benefits from a novel Cross-slice non-maximum suppression (C-NMS) algorithm to precisely localize objects from noisy windows and a simple yet effective multi-scale strategy to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments on two HRW benchmarks, PANDA and DOTA-v1.0, demonstrate that the proposed SparseFormer significantly improves detection accuracy (up to 5.8%) and speed (up to 3x) over the state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Pathology plays a critical role in diagnosing a wide range of diseases, yet existing approaches often rely heavily on task-specific models trained on extensive, well-labeled datasets. These methods face sustainability challenges due to the diversity of pathologies and the labor-intensive nature of data collection. To address these limitations, we highlight the need for universal multimodal embeddings that can support multiple downstream tasks. Previous approaches often involve fine-tuning CLIP-based models, which handle images and text separately, limiting their ability to capture complex multimodal relationships. Additionally, these models are evaluated across diverse datasets without a unified benchmark for assessing multimodal embeddings in pathology. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM4PUE, a novel framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate Pathology Universal Embeddings. The MLLM4PUE framework not only facilitates robust integration of images and text but also enhances understanding and fusion capabilities across various tasks. We further introduce the Pathology Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (PMEB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the quality of pathology multimodal embeddings. PMEB comprises 15 original tasks drawn from 14 datasets, organized into three meta-tasks: retrieval, classification, and composed retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MLLM4PUE, illustrating MLLM-based models can effectively support a wide range of downstream tasks and unify the research direction for foundation models in pathology.

- **Summary**: Latent diffusion models have recently demonstrated superior capabilities in many downstream image synthesis tasks. However, customization of latent diffusion models using unauthorized data can severely compromise the privacy and intellectual property rights of data owners. Adversarial examples as protective perturbations have been developed to defend against unauthorized data usage by introducing imperceptible noise to customization samples, preventing diffusion models from effectively learning them. In this paper, we first reveal that the primary reason adversarial examples are effective as protective perturbations in latent diffusion models is the distortion of their latent representations, as demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative experiments. We then propose the Contrastive Adversarial Training (CAT) utilizing adapters as an adaptive attack against these protection methods, highlighting their lack of robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CAT method significantly reduces the effectiveness of protective perturbations in customization configurations, urging the community to reconsider and enhance the robustness of existing protective perturbation methods.

- **Summary**: Transparent object manipulation remains a sig- nificant challenge in robotics due to the difficulty of acquiring accurate and dense depth measurements. Conventional depth sensors often fail with transparent objects, resulting in in- complete or erroneous depth data. Existing depth completion methods struggle with interframe consistency and incorrectly model transparent objects as Lambertian surfaces, leading to poor depth reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose TranSplat, a surface embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting method tailored for transparent objects. TranSplat uses a latent diffusion model to generate surface embeddings that provide consistent and continuous representations, making it robust to changes in viewpoint and lighting. By integrating these surface embeddings with input RGB images, TranSplat effectively captures the complexities of transparent surfaces, enhancing the splatting of 3D Gaussians and improving depth completion. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world transpar- ent object benchmarks, as well as robot grasping tasks, show that TranSplat achieves accurate and dense depth completion, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications.

- **Summary**: While recent advances in object suction grasping have shown remarkable progress, significant challenges persist particularly in cluttered and complex parcel handling scenarios. Two fundamental limitations hinder current approaches: (1) the lack of a comprehensive suction grasp dataset tailored for parcel manipulation tasks, and (2) insufficient adaptability to diverse object characteristics including size variations, geometric complexity, and textural diversity. To address these challenges, we present Parcel-Suction-Dataset, a large-scale synthetic dataset containing 25 thousand cluttered scenes with 410 million precision-annotated suction grasp poses. This dataset is generated through our novel geometric sampling algorithm that enables efficient generation of optimal suction grasps incorporating both physical constraints and material properties. We further propose Diffusion-Suction, an innovative framework that reformulates suction grasp prediction as a conditional generation task through denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our method iteratively refines random noise into suction grasp score maps through visual-conditioned guidance from point cloud observations, effectively learning spatial point-wise affordances from our synthetic dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the simple yet efficient Diffusion-Suction achieves new state-of-the-art performance compared to previous models on both Parcel-Suction-Dataset and the public SuctionNet-1Billion benchmark.

- **Summary**: Co-speech gesture generation is crucial for creating lifelike avatars and enhancing human-computer interactions by synchronizing gestures with speech. Despite recent advancements, existing methods struggle with accurately identifying the rhythmic or semantic triggers from audio for generating contextualized gesture patterns and achieving pixel-level realism. To address these challenges, we introduce Contextual Gesture, a framework that improves co-speech gesture video generation through three innovative components: (1) a chronological speech-gesture alignment that temporally connects two modalities, (2) a contextualized gesture tokenization that incorporate speech context into motion pattern representation through distillation, and (3) a structure-aware refinement module that employs edge connection to link gesture keypoints to improve video generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Contextual Gesture not only produces realistic and speech-aligned gesture videos but also supports long-sequence generation and video gesture editing applications, shown in Fig.1 Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Contextual-Gesture/.

- **Summary**: Fingerprint localization has gained significant attention due to its cost-effective deployment, low complexity, and high efficacy. However, traditional methods, while effective for static data, often struggle in dynamic environments where data distributions and feature spaces evolve-a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. To address the challenges of robustness and adaptability in fingerprint localization for dynamic indoor environments, this paper proposes DF-Loc, an end-to-end dynamic fingerprint localization system based on multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA). DF-Loc leverages historical data from multiple time scales to facilitate knowledge transfer in specific feature spaces, thereby enhancing generalization capabilities in the target domain and reducing reliance on labeled data. Specifically, the system incorporates a Quality Control (QC) module for CSI data preprocessing and employs image processing techniques for CSI fingerprint feature reconstruction. Additionally, a multi-scale attention-based feature fusion backbone network is designed to extract multi-level transferable fingerprint features. Finally, a dual-stage alignment model aligns the distributions of multiple source-target domain pairs, improving regression characteristics in the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted in office and classroom environments demonstrate that DF-Loc outperforms comparative methods in terms of both localization accuracy and robustness. With 60% of reference points used for training, DF-Loc achieves average localization errors of 0.79m and 3.72m in "same-test" scenarios, and 0.94m and 4.39m in "different-test" scenarios, respectively. This work pioneers an end-to-end multi-source transfer learning approach for fingerprint localization, providing valuable insights for future research in dynamic environments.

- **Summary**: Solar filaments are one of the most prominent features observed on the Sun, and their evolutions are closely related to various solar activities, such as flares and coronal mass ejections. Real-time automated identification of solar filaments is the most effective approach to managing large volumes of data. Existing models of filament identification are characterized by large parameter sizes and high computational costs, which limit their future applications in highly integrated and intelligent ground-based and space-borne observation devices. Consequently, the design of more lightweight models will facilitate the advancement of intelligent observation equipment. In this study, we introduce Flat U-Net, a novel and highly efficient ultralightweight model that incorporates simplified channel attention (SCA) and channel self-attention (CSA) convolutional blocks for the segmentation of solar filaments in full-disk H$\alpha$ images. Feature information from each network layer is fully extracted to reconstruct interchannel feature representations. Each block effectively optimizes the channel features from the previous layer, significantly reducing parameters. The network architecture presents an elegant flattening, improving its efficiency, and simplifying the overall design. Experimental validation demonstrates that a model composed of pure SCAs achieves a precision of approximately 0.93, with dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and recall rates of 0.76 and 0.64, respectively, significantly outperforming the classical U-Net. Introducing a certain number of CSA blocks improves the DSC and recall rates to 0.82 and 0.74, respectively, which demonstrates a pronounced advantage, particularly concerning model weight size and detection effectiveness. The data set, models, and code are available as open-source resources.

- **Summary**: In deepfake detection, it is essential to maintain high performance by adjusting the parameters of the detector as new deepfake methods emerge. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically and actively select the small amount of additional data required for the continuous training of deepfake detection models in situations where deepfake detection models are regularly updated. The proposed method automatically selects new training data from a \textit{redundant} pool set containing a large number of images generated by new deepfake methods and real images, using the confidence score of the deepfake detection model as a metric. Experimental results show that the deepfake detection model, continuously trained with a small amount of additional data automatically selected and added to the original training set, significantly and efficiently improved the detection performance, achieving an EER of 2.5% with only 15% of the amount of data in the pool set.

- **Summary**: High-quality open-source datasets, which necessitate substantial efforts for curation, has become the primary catalyst for the swift progress of deep learning. Concurrently, protecting these datasets is paramount for the well-being of the data owner. Dataset ownership verification emerges as a crucial method in this domain, but existing approaches are often limited to supervised models and cannot be directly extended to increasingly popular unsupervised pre-trained models. In this work, we propose the first dataset ownership verification method tailored specifically for self-supervised pre-trained models by contrastive learning. Its primary objective is to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box backbone has been pre-trained on a specific unlabeled dataset, aiding dataset owners in upholding their rights. The proposed approach is motivated by our empirical insights that when models are trained with the target dataset, the unary and binary instance relationships within the embedding space exhibit significant variations compared to models trained without the target dataset. We validate the efficacy of this approach across multiple contrastive pre-trained models including SimCLR, BYOL, SimSiam, MOCO v3, and DINO. The results demonstrate that our method rejects the null hypothesis with a $p$-value markedly below $0.05$, surpassing all previous methodologies.

- **Summary**: We present ATOP (Articulate That Object Part), a novel method based on motion personalization to articulate a 3D object with respect to a part and its motion as prescribed in a text prompt. Specifically, the text input allows us to tap into the power of modern-day video diffusion to generate plausible motion samples for the right object category and part. In turn, the input 3D object provides image prompting to personalize the generated video to that very object we wish to articulate. Our method starts with a few-shot finetuning for category-specific motion generation, a key first step to compensate for the lack of articulation awareness by current video diffusion models. For this, we finetune a pre-trained multi-view image generation model for controllable multi-view video generation, using a small collection of video samples obtained for the target object category. This is followed by motion video personalization that is realized by multi-view rendered images of the target 3D object. At last, we transfer the personalized video motion to the target 3D object via differentiable rendering to optimize part motion parameters by a score distillation sampling loss. We show that our method is capable of generating realistic motion videos and predict 3D motion parameters in a more accurate and generalizable way, compared to prior works.

- **Summary**: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health issue, affecting over 10% of the population and causing significant mortality. While kidney biopsy remains the gold standard for CKD diagnosis and treatment, the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for kidney pathology segmentation hinders progress in the field. To address this, we organized the Kidney Pathology Image Segmentation (KPIs) Challenge, introducing a dataset that incorporates preclinical rodent models of CKD with over 10,000 annotated glomeruli from 60+ Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS)-stained whole slide images. The challenge includes two tasks, patch-level segmentation and whole slide image segmentation and detection, evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and F1-score. By encouraging innovative segmentation methods that adapt to diverse CKD models and tissue conditions, the KPIs Challenge aims to advance kidney pathology analysis, establish new benchmarks, and enable precise, large-scale quantification for disease research and diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Depth completion endeavors to reconstruct a dense depth map from sparse depth measurements, leveraging the information provided by a corresponding color image. Existing approaches mostly hinge on single-scale propagation strategies that iteratively ameliorate initial coarse depth estimates through pixel-level message passing. Despite their commendable outcomes, these techniques are frequently hampered by computational inefficiencies and a limited grasp of scene context. To circumvent these challenges, we introduce LP-Net, an innovative framework that implements a multi-scale, progressive prediction paradigm based on Laplacian Pyramid decomposition. Diverging from propagation-based approaches, LP-Net initiates with a rudimentary, low-resolution depth prediction to encapsulate the global scene context, subsequently refining this through successive upsampling and the reinstatement of high-frequency details at incremental scales. We have developed two novel modules to bolster this strategy: 1) the Multi-path Feature Pyramid module, which segregates feature maps into discrete pathways, employing multi-scale transformations to amalgamate comprehensive spatial information, and 2) the Selective Depth Filtering module, which dynamically learns to apply both smoothness and sharpness filters to judiciously mitigate noise while accentuating intricate details. By integrating these advancements, LP-Net not only secures state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across both outdoor and indoor benchmarks such as KITTI, NYUv2, and TOFDC, but also demonstrates superior computational efficiency. At the time of submission, LP-Net ranks 1st among all peer-reviewed methods on the official KITTI leaderboard.

- **Summary**: Multi-class cell segmentation in high-resolution gigapixel whole slide images (WSI) is crucial for various clinical applications. However, training such models typically requires labor-intensive, pixel-wise annotations by domain experts. Recent efforts have democratized this process by involving lay annotators without medical expertise. However, conventional non-agent-based approaches struggle to handle annotation noise adaptively, as they lack mechanisms to mitigate false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) at both the image-feature and pixel levels. In this paper, we propose a consensus-aware self-corrective AI agent that leverages the Consensus Matrix to guide its learning process. The Consensus Matrix defines regions where both the AI and annotators agree on cell and non-cell annotations, which are prioritized with stronger supervision. Conversely, areas of disagreement are adaptively weighted based on their feature similarity to high-confidence agreement regions, with more similar regions receiving greater attention. Additionally, contrastive learning is employed to separate features of noisy regions from those of reliable agreement regions by maximizing their dissimilarity. This paradigm enables the AI to iteratively refine noisy labels, enhancing its robustness. Validated on one real-world lay-annotated cell dataset and two simulated noisy datasets, our method demonstrates improved segmentation performance, effectively correcting FP and FN errors and showcasing its potential for training robust models on noisy datasets. The official implementation and cell annotations are publicly available at https://github.com/ddrrnn123/CASC-AI.

Given navigation instruction in natural language, we first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names, which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the path fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches that use joint semantic maps like VLMaps \cite{vlmaps} on the complex R2R-Habitat \cite{r2r} instruction dataset and quantify in detail the effect of visual grounding on navigation performance.

- **Summary**: Understanding world dynamics is crucial for planning in autonomous driving. Recent methods attempt to achieve this by learning a 3D occupancy world model that forecasts future surrounding scenes based on current observation. However, 3D occupancy labels are still required to produce promising results. Considering the high annotation cost for 3D outdoor scenes, we propose a semi-supervised vision-centric 3D occupancy world model, PreWorld, to leverage the potential of 2D labels through a novel two-stage training paradigm: the self-supervised pre-training stage and the fully-supervised fine-tuning stage. Specifically, during the pre-training stage, we utilize an attribute projection head to generate different attribute fields of a scene (e.g., RGB, density, semantic), thus enabling temporal supervision from 2D labels via volume rendering techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective state-conditioned forecasting module to recursively forecast future occupancy and ego trajectory in a direct manner. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method, and demonstrate that PreWorld achieves competitive performance across 3D occupancy prediction, 4D occupancy forecasting and motion planning tasks.

- **Summary**: Structural information in images is crucial for aesthetic assessment, and it is widely recognized in the artistic field that imitating the structure of other works significantly infringes on creators' rights. The advancement of diffusion models has led to AI-generated content imitating artists' structural creations, yet effective detection methods are still lacking. In this paper, we define this phenomenon as "structural infringement" and propose a corresponding detection method. Additionally, we develop quantitative metrics and create manually annotated datasets for evaluation: the SIA dataset of synthesized data, and the SIR dataset of real data. Due to the current lack of datasets for structural infringement detection, we propose a new data synthesis strategy based on diffusion models and LLM, successfully training a structural infringement detection model. Experimental results show that our method can successfully detect structural infringements and achieve notable improvements on annotated test sets.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), the creation of high-quality AI-generated videos has become faster and easier, resulting in the Internet being flooded with all kinds of video content. However, the impact of these videos on the content ecosystem remains largely unexplored. Video information retrieval remains a fundamental approach for accessing video content. Building on the observation that retrieval models often favor AI-generated content in ad-hoc and image retrieval tasks, we investigate whether similar biases emerge in the context of challenging video retrieval, where temporal and visual factors may further influence model behavior. To explore this, we first construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing both real and AI-generated videos, along with a set of fair and rigorous metrics to assess bias. This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by two state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously design a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference, accounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and suboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video retrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our findings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval. Further investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the training set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference observed in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from both unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video bias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we fine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach. The results of this study highlight the potential implications of AI-generated videos on retrieval systems.

- **Summary**: Manual segmentation is labor-intensive, and automatic segmentation remains challenging due to the inherent variability in meniscal morphology, partial volume effects, and low contrast between the meniscus and surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, we propose ERANet, an innovative semi-supervised framework for meniscus segmentation that effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled images through advanced augmentation and learning strategies. ERANet integrates three key components: edge replacement augmentation (ERA), prototype consistency alignment (PCA), and a conditional self-training (CST) strategy within a mean teacher architecture. ERA introduces anatomically relevant perturbations by simulating meniscal variations, ensuring that augmentations align with the structural context. PCA enhances segmentation performance by aligning intra-class features and promoting compact, discriminative feature representations, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. CST improves segmentation robustness by iteratively refining pseudo-labels and mitigating the impact of label noise during training. Together, these innovations establish ERANet as a robust and scalable solution for meniscus segmentation, effectively addressing key barriers to practical implementation. We validated ERANet comprehensively on 3D Double Echo Steady State (DESS) and 3D Fast/Turbo Spin Echo (FSE/TSE) MRI sequences. The results demonstrate the superior performance of ERANet compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed framework achieves reliable and accurate segmentation of meniscus structures, even when trained on minimal labeled data. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the synergistic contributions of ERA, PCA, and CST, solidifying ERANet as a transformative solution for semi-supervised meniscus segmentation in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), a prevalent spinal deformity, significantly affects individuals' health and quality of life. Conventional imaging techniques, such as X - rays, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offer static views of the spine. However, they are restricted in capturing the dynamic changes of the spine and its interactions with overall body motion. Therefore, developing new techniques to address these limitations has become extremely important. Dynamic digital human modeling represents a major breakthrough in digital medicine. It enables a three - dimensional (3D) view of the spine as it changes during daily activities, assisting clinicians in detecting deformities that might be missed in static imaging. Although dynamic modeling holds great potential, constructing an accurate static digital human model is a crucial initial step for high - precision simulations. In this study, our focus is on constructing an accurate static digital human model integrating the spine, which is vital for subsequent dynamic digital human research on AIS. First, we generate human point - cloud data by combining the 3D Gaussian method with the Skinned Multi - Person Linear (SMPL) model from the patient's multi - view images. Then, we fit a standard skeletal model to the generated human model. Next, we align the real spine model reconstructed from CT images with the standard skeletal model. We validated the resulting personalized spine model using X - ray data from six AIS patients, with Cobb angles (used to measure the severity of scoliosis) as evaluation metrics. The results indicate that the model's error was within 1 degree of the actual measurements. This study presents an important method for constructing digital humans.

- **Summary**: Salient object detection (SOD) plays a critical role in vision-driven measurement systems (VMS), facilitating the detection and segmentation of key visual elements in an image. However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality, and complicating the SOD process. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-task-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MToIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MToIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MToIE surpasses existing methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of vision systems across diverse imaging scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/Ai-Chen-Lab/MToIE.

- **Summary**: Video microscopy, when combined with machine learning, offers a promising approach for studying the early development of in vitro produced (IVP) embryos. However, manually annotating developmental events, and more specifically cell divisions, is time-consuming for a biologist and cannot scale up for practical applications. We aim to automatically classify the cell stages of embryos from 2D time-lapse microscopy videos with a deep learning approach. We focus on the analysis of bovine embryonic development using video microscopy, as we are primarily interested in the application of cattle breeding, and we have created a Bovine Embryos Cell Stages (ECS) dataset. The challenges are three-fold: (1) low-quality images and bovine dark cells that make the identification of cell stages difficult, (2) class ambiguity at the boundaries of developmental stages, and (3) imbalanced data distribution. To address these challenges, we introduce CLEmbryo, a novel method that leverages supervised contrastive learning combined with focal loss for training, and the lightweight 3D neural network CSN-50 as an encoder. We also show that our method generalizes well. CLEmbryo outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both our Bovine ECS dataset and the publicly available NYU Mouse Embryos dataset.

- **Summary**: Advancements in computer vision technology have facilitated the extensive deployment of intelligent transportation systems and visual surveillance systems across various applications, including autonomous driving, public safety, and environmental monitoring. However, adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, snow, and more complex mixed degradation can significantly degrade image quality. The degradation compromises the accuracy and reliability of these systems across various scenarios. To tackle the challenge of developing adaptable models for scene restoration, we introduce the unified scene recovery network (USRNet), capable of handling multiple types of image degradation. The USRNet features a sophisticated architecture consisting of a scene encoder, an attention-driven node independent learning mechanism (NILM), an edge decoder, and a scene restoration module. The scene encoder, powered by advanced residual blocks, extracts deep features from degraded images in a progressive manner, ensuring thorough encoding of degradation information. To enhance the USRNet's adaptability in diverse weather conditions, we introduce NILM, which enables the network to learn and respond to different scenarios with precision, thereby increasing its robustness. The edge decoder is designed to extract edge features with precision, which is essential for maintaining image sharpness. Experimental results demonstrate that USRNet surpasses existing methods in handling complex imaging degradations, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of visual systems across diverse scenarios.

- **Summary**: Due to limitations of storage and bandwidth, videos stored and transmitted on the Internet are usually low-quality with low-resolution and compression noise. Although video super-resolution (VSR) is an efficient technique to enhance video resolution, relatively VSR methods focus on compressed videos. Directly applying general VSR approaches leads to the failure of improving practical videos, especially when frames are highly compressed at a low bit rate. Recently, diffusion models have achieved superior performance in low-level visual tasks, and their high-realism generation capability enables them to be applied in VSR. To synthesize more compression-lost details and refine temporal consistency, we propose a novel Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent (SDATC) diffusion model for compressed VSR. Specifically, we introduce a distortion Control module (DCM) to modulate diffusion model inputs and guide the generation. Next, the diffusion model executes the denoising process for texture generation with fine-tuned spatial prompt-based compression-aware module (PCAM) and spatio-temporal attention module (STAM). PCAM extracts features to encode specific compression information dynamically. STAM extends the spatial attention mechanism to a spatio-temporal dimension for capturing temporal correlation. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in enhancing compressed videos.

- **Summary**: Cardiovascular diseases, a leading cause of noncommunicable disease-related deaths, require early and accurate detection to improve patient outcomes. Taking advantage of advances in machine learning and deep learning, multiple approaches have been proposed in the literature to address the challenge of detecting ECG anomalies. Typically, these methods are based on the manual interpretation of ECG signals, which is time consuming and depends on the expertise of healthcare professionals. The objective of this work is to propose a deep learning system, FADE, designed for normal ECG forecasting and anomaly detection, which reduces the need for extensive labeled datasets and manual interpretation. FADE has been trained in a self-supervised manner with a novel morphological inspired loss function. Unlike conventional models that learn from labeled anomalous ECG waveforms, our approach predicts the future of normal ECG signals, thus avoiding the need for extensive labeled datasets. Using a novel distance function to compare forecasted ECG signals with actual sensor data, our method effectively identifies cardiac anomalies. Additionally, this approach can be adapted to new contexts through domain adaptation techniques. To evaluate our proposal, we performed a set of experiments using two publicly available datasets: MIT-BIH NSR and MIT-BIH Arrythmia. The results demonstrate that our system achieves an average accuracy of 83.84% in anomaly detection, while correctly classifying normal ECG signals with an accuracy of 85.46%. Our proposed approach exhibited superior performance in the early detection of cardiac anomalies in ECG signals, surpassing previous methods that predominantly identify a limited range of anomalies. FADE effectively detects both abnormal heartbeats and arrhythmias, offering significant advantages in healthcare through cost reduction or processing of large-scale ECG data.

- **Summary**: Generative models that can produce realistic images have improved significantly in recent years. The quality of the generated content has increased drastically, so sometimes it is very difficult to distinguish between the real images and the generated ones. Such an improvement comes at a price of ethical concerns about the usage of the generative models: the users of generative models can improperly claim ownership of the generated content protected by a license. In this paper, we propose an approach to embed watermarks into the generated content to allow future detection of the generated content and identification of the user who generated it. The watermark is embedded during the inference of the model, so the proposed approach does not require the retraining of the latter. We prove that watermarks embedded are guaranteed to be robust against additive perturbations of a bounded magnitude. We apply our method to watermark diffusion models and show that it matches state-of-the-art watermarking schemes in terms of robustness to different types of synthetic watermark removal attacks.

- **Summary**: 3D vision is of paramount importance for numerous applications ranging from machine intelligence to precision metrology. Despite much recent progress, the majority of 3D imaging hardware remains bulky and complicated and provides much lower image resolution compared to their 2D counterparts. Moreover, there are many well-known scenarios that existing 3D imaging solutions frequently fail. Here, we introduce an extended monocular 3D imaging (EM3D) framework that fully exploits the vectorial wave nature of light. Via the multi-stage fusion of diffraction- and polarization-based depth cues, using a compact monocular camera equipped with a diffractive-refractive hybrid lens, we experimentally demonstrate the snapshot acquisition of a million-pixel and accurate 3D point cloud for extended scenes that are traditionally challenging, including those with low texture, being highly reflective, or nearly transparent, without a data prior. Furthermore, we discover that the combination of depth and polarization information can unlock unique new opportunities in material identification, which may further expand machine intelligence for applications like target recognition and face anti-spoofing. The straightforward yet powerful architecture thus opens up a new path for a higher-dimensional machine vision in a minimal form factor, facilitating the deployment of monocular cameras for applications in much more diverse scenarios.

- **Summary**: Human-in-the-loop (HITL) frameworks are increasingly recognized for their potential to improve annotation accuracy in emotion estimation systems by combining machine predictions with human expertise. This study focuses on integrating a high-performing image-based emotion model into a HITL annotation framework to evaluate the collaborative potential of human-machine interaction and identify the psychological and practical factors critical to successful collaboration. Specifically, we investigate how varying model reliability and cognitive framing influence human trust, cognitive load, and annotation behavior in HITL systems. We demonstrate that model reliability and psychological framing significantly impact annotators' trust, engagement, and consistency, offering insights into optimizing HITL frameworks. Through three experimental scenarios with 29 participants--baseline model reliability (S1), fabricated errors (S2), and cognitive bias introduced by negative framing (S3)--we analyzed behavioral and qualitative data. Reliable predictions in S1 yielded high trust and annotation consistency, while unreliable outputs in S2 led to increased critical evaluations but also heightened frustration and response variability. Negative framing in S3 revealed how cognitive bias influenced participants to perceive the model as more relatable and accurate, despite misinformation regarding its reliability. These findings highlight the importance of both reliable machine outputs and psychological factors in shaping effective human-machine collaboration. By leveraging the strengths of both human oversight and automated systems, this study establishes a scalable HITL framework for emotion annotation and lays the foundation for broader applications in adaptive learning and human-computer interaction.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be catastrophically disrupted by flipping only a handful of sign bits in their parameters. We introduce Deep Neural Lesion (DNL), a data-free, lightweight method that locates these critical parameters and triggers massive accuracy drops. We validate its efficacy on a wide variety of computer vision models and datasets. The method requires no training data or optimization and can be carried out via common exploits software, firmware or hardware based attack vectors. An enhanced variant that uses a single forward and backward pass further amplifies the damage beyond DNL's zero-pass approach. Flipping just two sign bits in ResNet50 on ImageNet reduces accuracy by 99.8\%. We also show that selectively protecting a small fraction of vulnerable sign bits provides a practical defense against such attacks.

- **Summary**: Whole slide pathology image classification presents challenges due to gigapixel image sizes and limited annotation labels, hindering model generalization. This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP. We release our implementations and pre-trained models at this MGPATH.

- **Summary**: We introduce EgoTextVQA, a novel and rigorously constructed benchmark for egocentric QA assistance involving scene text. EgoTextVQA contains 1.5K ego-view videos and 7K scene-text aware questions that reflect real-user needs in outdoor driving and indoor house-keeping activities. The questions are designed to elicit identification and reasoning on scene text in an egocentric and dynamic environment. With EgoTextVQA, we comprehensively evaluate 10 prominent multimodal large language models. Currently, all models struggle, and the best results (Gemini 1.5 Pro) are around 33% accuracy, highlighting the severe deficiency of these techniques in egocentric QA assistance. Our further investigations suggest that precise temporal grounding and multi-frame reasoning, along with high resolution and auxiliary scene-text inputs, are key for better performance. With thorough analyses and heuristic suggestions, we hope EgoTextVQA can serve as a solid testbed for research in egocentric scene-text QA assistance.

- **Summary**: The perception system is a a critical role of an autonomous driving system for ensuring safety. The driving scene perception system fundamentally represents an object detection task that requires achieving a balance between accuracy and processing speed. Many contemporary methods focus on improving detection accuracy but often overlook the importance of real-time detection capabilities when computational resources are limited. Thus, it is vital to investigate efficient object detection strategies for driving scenes. This paper introduces Fast-COS, a novel single-stage object detection framework crafted specifically for driving scene applications. The research initiates with an analysis of the backbone, considering both macro and micro architectural designs, yielding the Reparameterized Attention Vision Transformer (RAViT). RAViT utilizes Reparameterized Multi-Scale Depth-Wise Convolution (RepMSDW) and Reparameterized Self-Attention (RepSA) to enhance computational efficiency and feature extraction. In extensive tests across GPU, edge, and mobile platforms, RAViT achieves 81.4% Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset, demonstrating significant throughput improvements over comparable backbone models such as ResNet, FastViT, RepViT, and EfficientFormer. Additionally, integrating RepMSDW into a feature pyramid network forms RepFPN, enabling fast and multi-scale feature fusion. Fast-COS enhances object detection in driving scenes, attaining an AP50 score of 57.2% on the BDD100K dataset and 80.0% on the TJU-DHD Traffic dataset. It surpasses leading models in efficiency, delivering up to 75.9% faster GPU inference and 1.38 higher throughput on edge devices compared to FCOS, YOLOF, and RetinaNet. These findings establish Fast-COS as a highly scalable and reliable solution suitable for real-time applications, especially in resource-limited environments like autonomous driving systems

- **Summary**: There has been a surge in optimizing edge Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for accuracy and efficiency using traditional optimization techniques such as pruning, and more recently, employing automatic design methodologies. However, the focus of these design techniques has often overlooked critical metrics such as fairness, robustness, and generalization. As a result, when evaluating SOTA edge DNNs' performance in image classification using the FACET dataset, we found that they exhibit significant accuracy disparities (14.09%) across 10 different skin tones, alongside issues of non-robustness and poor generalizability. In response to these observations, we introduce Mixture-of-Experts-based Neural Architecture Search (MoENAS), an automatic design technique that navigates through a space of mixture of experts to discover accurate, fair, robust, and general edge DNNs. MoENAS improves the accuracy by 4.02% compared to SOTA edge DNNs and reduces the skin tone accuracy disparities from 14.09% to 5.60%, while enhancing robustness by 3.80% and minimizing overfitting to 0.21%, all while keeping model size close to state-of-the-art models average size (+0.4M). With these improvements, MoENAS establishes a new benchmark for edge DNN design, paving the way for the development of more inclusive and robust edge DNNs.

- **Summary**: Despite being a successful example of emerging capability, vision-language foundation models for low-shot vision classification have a limited ability to sufficiently generalize to the target data distribution due to sample poverty, leading to sensitivity to variations in the data. A popular mitigation strategy is finetuning over multiple datasets, but domain generalization is expensive when practiced in this manner. This work examines both covariate shift between pre-training data and the underspecified target data, and \textit{confidence misalignment}, where the model's prediction confidence amplified by the limited data availability. We propose \textit{Confidence-Calibrated Covariate Shift Correction ($C3SC$)}, a unified framework to mitigate both covariate shift and confidence misalignment. $C3SC$ leverages Fisher information penalty for covariate shift correction and confidence misalignment penalty (CMP) to lower confidence on misclassified examples. Experimental results across various vision and covariate shift datasets demonstrates that $C3SC$ significantly improves in calibration (ECE) by $5.82\%$ at maximum. $C3SC$ shows better robustness as well by showing $3.5\%$ improvement in accuracy metric on challenging covariate shift datasets, making $C3SC$ a promising solution for reliable real-world vision-language low-shot applications under distribution shift.

- **Summary**: This study aims to advance surgical phase recognition in arthroscopic procedures, specifically Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction, by introducing the first arthroscopy dataset and developing a novel transformer-based model. We aim to establish a benchmark for arthroscopic surgical phase recognition by leveraging spatio-temporal features to address the specific challenges of arthroscopic videos including limited field of view, occlusions, and visual distortions. We developed the ACL27 dataset, comprising 27 videos of ACL surgeries, each labeled with surgical phases. Our model employs a transformer-based architecture, utilizing temporal-aware frame-wise feature extraction through a ResNet-50 and transformer layers. This approach integrates spatio-temporal features and introduces a Surgical Progress Index (SPI) to quantify surgery progression. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and Jaccard Index on the ACL27 and Cholec80 datasets. The proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 72.91% on the ACL27 dataset. On the Cholec80 dataset, the model achieved a comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of 92.4%. The SPI demonstrated an output error of 10.6% and 9.86% on ACL27 and Cholec80 datasets respectively, indicating reliable surgery progression estimation. This study introduces a significant advancement in surgical phase recognition for arthroscopy, providing a comprehensive dataset and a robust transformer-based model. The results validate the model's effectiveness and generalizability, highlighting its potential to improve surgical training, real-time assistance, and operational efficiency in orthopedic surgery. The publicly available dataset and code will facilitate future research and development in this critical field.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) in transformers often faces challenges due to misalignment in the number of attention heads between teacher and student models. Existing methods either require identical head counts or introduce projectors to bridge dimensional gaps, limiting flexibility and efficiency. We propose Squeezing-Heads Distillation (SHD), a novel approach that enables seamless knowledge transfer between models with varying head counts by compressing multi-head attention maps via efficient linear approximation. Unlike prior work, SHD eliminates alignment barriers without additional parameters or architectural modifications. Our method dynamically approximates the combined effect of multiple teacher heads into fewer student heads, preserving fine-grained attention patterns while reducing redundancy. Experiments across language (LLaMA, GPT) and vision (DiT, MDT) generative and vision (DeiT) discriminative tasks demonstrate SHD's effectiveness: it outperforms logit-based and feature-alignment KD baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in image classification, image generation language fine-tuning, and language pre-training. The key innovations of flexible head compression, projector-free design, and linear-time complexity make SHD a versatile and scalable solution for distilling modern transformers. This work bridges a critical gap in KD, enabling efficient deployment of compact models without compromising performance.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generation models have gained popularity among users around the world. However, many of these models exhibit a strong bias toward English-speaking cultures, ignoring or misrepresenting the unique characteristics of other language groups, countries, and nationalities. The lack of cultural awareness can reduce the generation quality and lead to undesirable consequences such as unintentional insult, and the spread of prejudice. In contrast to the field of natural language processing, cultural awareness in computer vision has not been explored as extensively. In this paper, we strive to reduce this gap. We propose a RusCode benchmark for evaluating the quality of text-to-image generation containing elements of the Russian cultural code. To do this, we form a list of 19 categories that best represent the features of Russian visual culture. Our final dataset consists of 1250 text prompts in Russian and their translations into English. The prompts cover a wide range of topics, including complex concepts from art, popular culture, folk traditions, famous people's names, natural objects, scientific achievements, etc. We present the results of a human evaluation of the side-by-side comparison of Russian visual concepts representations using popular generative models.

- **Summary**: Personalized federated learning (PFL) tailors models to clients' unique data distributions while preserving privacy. However, existing aggregation-weight-based PFL methods often struggle with heterogeneous data, facing challenges in accuracy, computational efficiency, and communication overhead. We propose FedAPA, a novel PFL method featuring a server-side, gradient-based adaptive aggregation strategy to generate personalized models, by updating aggregation weights based on gradients of client-parameter changes with respect to the aggregation weights in a centralized manner. FedAPA guarantees theoretical convergence and achieves superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to 10 PFL competitors across three datasets, with competitive communication overhead.

- **Summary**: In semi-supervised medical image segmentation, the poor quality of unlabeled data and the uncertainty in the model's predictions lead to models that inevitably produce erroneous pseudo-labels. These errors accumulate throughout model training, thereby weakening the model's performance. We found that these erroneous pseudo-labels are typically concentrated in high-uncertainty regions. Traditional methods improve performance by directly discarding pseudo-labels in these regions, but this can also result in neglecting potentially valuable training data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional uncertainty-aware region learning strategy. In training labeled data, we focus on high-uncertainty regions, using precise label information to guide the model's learning in potentially uncontrollable areas. Meanwhile, in the training of unlabeled data, we concentrate on low-uncertainty regions to reduce the interference of erroneous pseudo-labels on the model. Through this bidirectional learning strategy, the model's overall performance has significantly improved. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant performance improvement on different medical image segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Given a style-reference image as the additional image condition, text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating images that possess the content of text prompts while adopting the visual style of the reference image. However, current state-of-the-art methods often struggle to disentangle content and style from style-reference images, leading to issues such as content leakages. To address this issue, we propose a masking-based method that efficiently decouples content from style without the need of tuning any model parameters. By simply masking specific elements in the style reference's image features, we uncover a critical yet under-explored principle: guiding with appropriately-selected fewer conditions (e.g., dropping several image feature elements) can efficiently avoid unwanted content flowing into the diffusion models, enhancing the style transfer performances of text-to-image diffusion models. In this paper, we validate this finding both theoretically and experimentally. Extensive experiments across various styles demonstrate the effectiveness of our masking-based method and support our theoretical results.

- **Summary**: Road information extraction from 3D point clouds is useful for urban planning and traffic management. Existing methods often rely on local features and the refraction angle of lasers from kerbs, which makes them sensitive to variable kerb designs and issues in high-density areas due to data homogeneity. We propose an approach for extracting road points and fitting centrelines using a top-down view of LiDAR based ground-collected point clouds. This prospective view reduces reliance on specific kerb design and results in better road extraction. We first perform statistical outlier removal and density-based clustering to reduce noise from 3D point cloud data. Next, we perform ground point filtering using a grid-based segmentation method that adapts to diverse road scenarios and terrain characteristics. The filtered points are then projected onto a 2D plane, and the road is extracted by a skeletonisation algorithm. The skeleton is back-projected onto the 3D point cloud with calculated normals, which guide a region growing algorithm to find nearby road points. The extracted road points are then smoothed with the Savitzky-Golay filter to produce the final centreline. Our initial approach without post-processing of road skeleton achieved 67% in IoU by testing on the Perth CBD dataset with different road types. Incorporating the post-processing of the road skeleton improved the extraction of road points around the smoothed skeleton. The refined approach achieved a higher IoU value of 73% and with 23% reduction in the processing time. Our approach offers a generalised and computationally efficient solution that combines 3D and 2D processing techniques, laying the groundwork for future road reconstruction and 3D-to-2D point cloud alignment.

- **Summary**: Attributing APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) malware to their respective groups is crucial for threat intelligence and cybersecurity. However, APT adversaries often conceal their identities, rendering attribution inherently adversarial. Existing machine learning-based attribution models, while effective, remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. For example, the state-of-the-art byte-level model MalConv sees its accuracy drop from over 90% to below 2% under PGD (projected gradient descent) attacks. Existing gradient-based adversarial training techniques for malware detection or image processing were applied to malware attribution in this study, revealing that both robustness and training efficiency require significant improvement. To address this, we propose RoMA, a novel single-step adversarial training approach that integrates global perturbations to generate enhanced adversarial samples and employs adversarial consistency regularization to improve representation quality and resilience. A novel APT malware dataset named AMG18, with diverse samples and realistic class imbalances, is introduced for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that RoMA significantly outperforms seven competing methods in both adversarial robustness (e.g., achieving over 80% robust accuracy-more than twice that of the next-best method under PGD attacks) and training efficiency (e.g., more than twice as fast as the second-best method in terms of accuracy), while maintaining superior standard accuracy in non-adversarial scenarios.

- **Summary**: Extending the translation equivariance property of convolutional neural networks to larger symmetry groups has been shown to reduce sample complexity and enable more discriminative feature learning. Further, exploiting additional symmetries facilitates greater weight sharing than standard convolutions, leading to an enhanced network expressivity without an increase in parameter count. However, extending the equivariant properties of a convolution layer comes at a computational cost. In particular, for 3D data, expanding equivariance to the SE(3) group (rotation and translation) results in a 6D convolution operation, which is not tractable for larger data samples such as 3D scene scans. While efforts have been made to develop efficient SE(3) equivariant networks, existing approaches rely on discretization or only introduce global rotation equivariance. This limits their applicability to point clouds representing a scene composed of multiple objects. This work presents an efficient, continuous, and local SE(3) equivariant convolution layer for point cloud processing based on general group convolution and local reference frames. Our experiments show that our approach achieves competitive or superior performance across a range of datasets and tasks, including object classification and semantic segmentation, with negligible computational overhead.

- **Summary**: DiT-based video generation has achieved remarkable results, but research into enhancing existing models remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce a training-free approach to enhance the coherence and quality of DiT-based generated videos, named Enhance-A-Video. The core idea is enhancing the cross-frame correlations based on non-diagonal temporal attention distributions. Thanks to its simple design, our approach can be easily applied to most DiT-based video generation frameworks without any retraining or fine-tuning. Across various DiT-based video generation models, our approach demonstrates promising improvements in both temporal consistency and visual quality. We hope this research can inspire future explorations in video generation enhancement.

- **Summary**: Background. Recently, dynamic total-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become possible due to new scanner devices. While clustering algorithms have been proposed for PET analysis already earlier, there is still little research systematically evaluating these algorithms for processing of dynamic total-body PET images. Materials and methods. Here, we compare the performance of 15 unsupervised clustering methods, including K-means either by itself or after principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), fuzzy c-means (FCM), agglomerative clustering, spectral clustering, and several newer clustering algorithms, for classifying time activity curves (TACs) in dynamic PET images. We use dynamic total-body $^{15}$O-water PET images collected from 30 patients with suspected or confirmed coronary artery disease. To evaluate the clustering algorithms in a quantitative way, we use them to classify 5000 TACs from each image based on whether the curve is taken from brain, right heart ventricle, right kidney, lower right lung lobe, or urinary bladder. Results. According to our results, the best methods are GMM, FCM, and ICA combined with mini batch K-means, which classified the TACs with a median accuracies of 89\%, 83\%, and 81\%, respectively, in a processing time of half a second or less on average for each image. Conclusion. GMM, FCM, and ICA with mini batch K-means show promise for dynamic total-body PET analysis.

- **Summary**: Generative models, particularly text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, play a crucial role in medical image analysis. However, these models are prone to training data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy. Synthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in medical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data repository for this task. This study adopts a data-driven approach and presents the first systematic attempt to identify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to training data memorization. Our analysis reveals an unexpected finding: prompts containing traces of de-identification procedures are among the most memorized, with de-identification markers contributing the most. Furthermore, we also find existing inference-time memorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently reduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens highlighting a broader issue in T2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. On this front, we propose actionable strategies to enhance privacy and improve the reliability of generative models in medical imaging. Finally, our results provide a foundation for future work on developing and benchmarking memorization mitigation techniques for synthetic chest X-ray generation using the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

- **Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims to measure non-contact physiological signals from facial videos, which has shown great potential in many applications. Most existing methods directly extract video-based rPPG features by designing neural networks for heart rate estimation. Although they can achieve acceptable results, the recovery of rPPG signal faces intractable challenges when interference from real-world scenarios takes place on facial video. Specifically, facial videos are inevitably affected by non-physiological factors (e.g., camera device noise, defocus, and motion blur), leading to the distortion of extracted rPPG signals. Recent rPPG extraction methods are easily affected by interference and degradation, resulting in noisy rPPG signals. In this paper, we propose a novel method named CodePhys, which innovatively treats rPPG measurement as a code query task in a noise-free proxy space (i.e., codebook) constructed by ground-truth PPG signals. We consider noisy rPPG features as queries and generate high-fidelity rPPG features by matching them with noise-free PPG features from the codebook. Our approach also incorporates a spatial-aware encoder network with a spatial attention mechanism to highlight physiologically active areas and uses a distillation loss to reduce the influence of non-periodic visual interference.

- **Summary**: Recent image-to-video generation methods have demonstrated success in enabling control over one or two visual elements, such as camera trajectory or object motion. However, these methods are unable to offer control over multiple visual elements due to limitations in data and network efficacy. In this paper, we introduce VidCRAFT3, a novel framework for precise image-to-video generation that enables control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction simultaneously. To better decouple control over each visual element, we propose the Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer, which integrates lighting direction, text, and image in a symmetric way. Since most real-world video datasets lack lighting annotations, we construct a high-quality synthetic video dataset, the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset. This dataset includes lighting direction annotations and objects of diverse appearance, enabling VidCRAFT3 to effectively handle strong light transmission and reflection effects. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training strategy that eliminates the need for training data annotated with multiple visual elements (camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction) simultaneously. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of VidCRAFT3 in producing high-quality video content, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of control granularity and visual coherence. All code and data will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Global leaders and policymakers are unified in their unequivocal commitment to decarbonization efforts in support of Net-Zero agreements. District Heating Systems (DHS), while contributing to carbon emissions due to the continued reliance on fossil fuels for heat production, are embracing more sustainable practices albeit with some sense of vulnerability as it could constrain their ability to adapt to dynamic demand and production scenarios. As demographic demands grow and renewables become the central strategy in decarbonizing the heating sector, the need for accurate demand forecasting has intensified. Advances in digitization have paved the way for Machine Learning (ML) based solutions to become the industry standard for modeling complex time series patterns. In this paper, we focus on building a Deep Learning (DL) model that uses deconstructed components of independent and dependent variables that affect heat demand as features to perform multi-step ahead forecasting of head demand. The model represents the input features in a time-frequency space and uses an attention mechanism to generate accurate forecasts. The proposed method is evaluated on a real-world dataset and the forecasting performance is assessed against LSTM and CNN-based forecasting models. Across different supply zones, the attention-based models outperforms the baselines quantitatively and qualitatively, with an Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.105 with a standard deviation of 0.06kW h and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5.4% with a standard deviation of 2.8%, in comparison the second best model with a MAE of 0.10 with a standard deviation of 0.06kW h and a MAPE of 5.6% with a standard deviation of 3%.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image models can generate visually appealing images from text descriptions. Efforts have been devoted to improving model controls with prompt tuning and spatial conditioning. However, our formative study highlights the challenges for non-expert users in crafting appropriate prompts and specifying fine-grained spatial conditions (e.g., depth or canny references) to generate semantically cohesive images, especially when multiple objects are involved. In response, we introduce SketchFlex, an interactive system designed to improve the flexibility of spatially conditioned image generation using rough region sketches. The system automatically infers user prompts with rational descriptions within a semantic space enriched by crowd-sourced object attributes and relationships. Additionally, SketchFlex refines users' rough sketches into canny-based shape anchors, ensuring the generation quality and alignment of user intentions. Experimental results demonstrate that SketchFlex achieves more cohesive image generations than end-to-end models, meanwhile significantly reducing cognitive load and better matching user intentions compared to region-based generation baseline.

- **Summary**: Class-incremental learning (CIL) seeks to enable a model to sequentially learn new classes while retaining knowledge of previously learned ones. Balancing flexibility and stability remains a significant challenge, particularly when the task ID is unknown. To address this, our study reveals that the gap in feature distribution between novel and existing tasks is primarily driven by differences in mean and covariance moments. Building on this insight, we propose a novel semantic drift calibration method that incorporates mean shift compensation and covariance calibration. Specifically, we calculate each class's mean by averaging its sample embeddings and estimate task shifts using weighted embedding changes based on their proximity to the previous mean, effectively capturing mean shifts for all learned classes with each new task. We also apply Mahalanobis distance constraint for covariance calibration, aligning class-specific embedding covariances between old and current networks to mitigate the covariance shift. Additionally, we integrate a feature-level self-distillation approach to enhance generalization. Comprehensive experiments on commonly used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: The Perspective-Three-Point Problem (P3P) is solved by first focusing on determining the directions of the lines through pairs of control points, relative to the camera, rather than the distances from the camera to the control points. The analysis of this produces an efficient, accurate and reasonably simple P3P solver, which is compared with a state-of-the-art P3P solver, "Lambda Twist." Both methods depend on the accurate computation of a single root of a cubic polynomial. They have been implemented and tested for a wide range of control-point triangles, and under certain reasonable restrictions, the new method is noticably more accurate than Lambda Twist, though it is slower. However, the principal value of the present work is not in introducing yet another P3P solver, but lies rather in the discovery of an intimate connection between the P3P problem and a special family of elliptic curves that includes curves utilized in cryptography. This holds the potential for further advances in a number of directions. To make this connection, an interesting spherical analogue of an ancient "sliding" problem is stated and solved.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown remarkable performance in modeling and generating high-quality videos. However, the quadratic computational complexity of 3D full attention mechanism presents significant challenges in scaling video DiT training, especially for high-definition and lengthy videos, where attention can dominate up to 95% of the end-to-end time and necessitate specialized communication paradigms to handle large input sizes.   This paper introduces DSV, a novel framework designed to accelerate and scale the training of video DiTs by leveraging the inherent dynamic attention sparsity throughout the training process. DSV employs a two-stage training algorithm that exploits sparsity patterns, focusing on critical elements supported by efficient, tailored kernels. To accommodate the new sparsity dimension, we develop a hybrid sparsity-aware context parallelism that effectively scales to large inputs by addressing the heterogeneity of sparsity across attention heads and blocks, resulting in optimized sparse computation and communication. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DSV achieves up to 3.02x gain in training throughput with nearly no quality degradation.

- **Summary**: Mass-produced optical lenses often exhibit defects that alter their scattering properties and compromise quality standards. Manual inspection is usually adopted to detect defects, but it is not recommended due to low accuracy, high error rate and limited scalability. To address these challenges, this study presents an automated defect detection system based on the YOLOv8 deep learning model. A custom dataset of optical lenses, annotated with defect and lens regions, was created to train the model. Experimental results obtained in this study reveal that the system can be used to efficiently and accurately detect defects in optical lenses. The proposed system can be utilized in real-time industrial environments to enhance quality control processes by enabling reliable and scalable defect detection in optical lens manufacturing.

- **Summary**: Predicting future scene representations is a crucial task for enabling robots to understand and interact with the environment. However, most existing methods rely on video sequences and simulations with precise action annotations, limiting their ability to leverage the large amount of available unlabeled video data. To address this challenge, we propose PlaySlot, an object-centric video prediction model that infers object representations and latent actions from unlabeled video sequences. It then uses these representations to forecast future object states and video frames. PlaySlot allows to generate multiple possible futures conditioned on latent actions, which can be inferred from video dynamics, provided by a user, or generated by a learned action policy, thus enabling versatile and interpretable world modeling. Our results show that PlaySlot outperforms both stochastic and object-centric baselines for video prediction across different environments. Furthermore, we show that our inferred latent actions can be used to learn robot behaviors sample-efficiently from unlabeled video demonstrations.

- **Summary**: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) is an emerging AD paradigm. Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning. Extensions to medical and 3D AD are provided for future study. The link to our project page: https://xujiacong.github.io/Anomaly-OV/

- **Summary**: Image deblurring remains a central research area within image processing, critical for its role in enhancing image quality and facilitating clearer visual representations across diverse applications. This paper tackles the optimization problem of image deblurring, assuming a known blurring kernel. We introduce an improved optimal proximal gradient algorithm (IOptISTA), which builds upon the optimal gradient method and a weighting matrix, to efficiently address the non-blind image deblurring problem. Based on two regularization cases, namely the $l_1$ norm and total variation norm, we perform numerical experiments to assess the performance of our proposed algorithm. The results indicate that our algorithm yields enhanced PSNR and SSIM values, as well as a reduced tolerance, compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: In applications of diffusion models, controllable generation is of practical significance, but is also challenging. Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved excellent rendering quality with fast training and rendering speed. However, its optimization process lacks explicit geometric constraints, leading to suboptimal geometric reconstruction in regions with sparse or no observational input views. In this work, we try to mitigate the issue by incorporating a pre-trained matching prior to the 3DGS optimization process. We introduce Flow Distillation Sampling (FDS), a technique that leverages pre-trained geometric knowledge to bolster the accuracy of the Gaussian radiance field. Our method employs a strategic sampling technique to target unobserved views adjacent to the input views, utilizing the optical flow calculated from the matching model (Prior Flow) to guide the flow analytically calculated from the 3DGS geometry (Radiance Flow). Comprehensive experiments in depth rendering, mesh reconstruction, and novel view synthesis showcase the significant advantages of FDS over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our interpretive experiments and analysis aim to shed light on the effects of FDS on geometric accuracy and rendering quality, potentially providing readers with insights into its performance.

- **Summary**: We provide an empirical investigation of the potential of pre-training vision-language models on an unprecedented scale: 100 billion examples. We find that model performance tends to saturate at this scale on many common Western-centric classification and retrieval benchmarks, such as COCO Captions. Nevertheless, tasks of cultural diversity achieve more substantial gains from the 100-billion scale web data, thanks to its coverage of long-tail concepts. Furthermore, we analyze the model's multilinguality and show gains in low-resource languages as well. In addition, we observe that reducing the size of the pretraining dataset via quality filters like using CLIP, typically used to enhance performance, may inadvertently reduce the cultural diversity represented even in large-scale datasets. Our results highlight that while traditional benchmarks may not benefit significantly from scaling noisy, raw web data to 100 billion examples, this data scale is vital for building truly inclusive multimodal systems.

- **Summary**: The evolution of large-scale contrastive pre-training propelled by top-tier datasets has reached a transition point in the scaling law. Consequently, sustaining and enhancing a model's pre-training capabilities in drift environments have surfaced as a notable challenge. In this paper, we initially uncover that contrastive pre-training methods are significantly impacted by concept drift wherein distributions change unpredictably, resulting in notable biases in the feature space of the pre-trained model. Empowered by causal inference, we construct a structural causal graph to analyze the impact of concept drift to contrastive pre-training systemically, and propose the causal interventional contrastive objective. Upon achieving this, we devise a resilient contrastive pre-training approach to accommodate the data stream of concept drift, with simple and scalable implementation. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate our resilient contrastive pre-training effectively mitigates the bias stemming from the concept drift data stream.

- **Summary**: Perceiving the environment and its changes over time corresponds to two fundamental yet heterogeneous types of information: semantics and motion. Previous end-to-end autonomous driving works represent both types of information in a single feature vector. However, including motion tasks, such as prediction and planning, always impairs detection and tracking performance, a phenomenon known as negative transfer in multi-task learning. To address this issue, we propose Neural-Bayes motion decoding, a novel parallel detection, tracking, and prediction method separating semantic and motion learning, similar to the Bayes filter. Specifically, we employ a set of learned motion queries that operate in parallel with the detection and tracking queries, sharing a unified set of recursively updated reference points. Moreover, we employ interactive semantic decoding to enhance information exchange in semantic tasks, promoting positive transfer. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show improvements of 5% in detection and 11% in tracking. Our method achieves state-of-the-art collision rates in open-loop planning evaluation without any modifications to the planning module.

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer is a leading health concern among men, requiring accurate and accessible methods for early detection and risk stratification. Prostate volume (PV) is a key parameter in multivariate risk stratification for early prostate cancer detection, commonly estimated using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). While TRUS provides precise prostate volume measurements, its invasive nature often compromises patient comfort. Transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) provides a non-invasive alternative but faces challenges such as lower image quality, complex interpretation, and reliance on operator expertise. This study introduces a new deep-learning-based framework for automatic PV estimation using TAUS, emphasizing its potential to enable accurate and non-invasive prostate cancer risk stratification. A dataset of TAUS videos from 100 individual patients was curated, with manually delineated prostate boundaries and calculated diameters by an expert clinician as ground truth. The introduced framework integrates deep-learning models for prostate segmentation in both axial and sagittal planes, automatic prostate diameter estimation, and PV calculation. Segmentation performance was evaluated using Dice correlation coefficient (%) and Hausdorff distance (mm). Framework's volume estimation capabilities were evaluated on volumetric error (mL). The framework demonstrates that it can estimate PV from TAUS videos with a mean volumetric error of -5.5 mL, which results in an average relative error between 5 and 15%. The introduced framework for automatic PV estimation from TAUS images, utilizing deep learning models for prostate segmentation, shows promising results. It effectively segments the prostate and estimates its volume, offering potential for reliable, non-invasive risk stratification for early prostate detection.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration is an essential step for free-form blade reconstruction in industrial measurement. Nonetheless, measuring defects of the 3D acquisition system unavoidably result in noisy and incomplete point cloud data, which renders efficient and accurate registration challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel global registration method that is based on the minimum potential energy (MPE) method to address these problems. The basic strategy is that the objective function is defined as the minimum potential energy optimization function of the physical registration system. The function distributes more weight to the majority of inlier points and less weight to the noise and outliers, which essentially reduces the influence of perturbations in the mathematical formulation. We decompose the solution into a globally optimal approximation procedure and a fine registration process with the trimmed iterative closest point algorithm to boost convergence. The approximation procedure consists of two main steps. First, according to the construction of the force traction operator, we can simply compute the position of the potential energy minimum. Second, to find the MPE point, we propose a new theory that employs two flags to observe the status of the registration procedure. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm on four types of blades. The proposed method outperforms the other global methods in terms of both accuracy and noise resistance.

- **Summary**: We present Matrix3D, a unified model that performs several photogrammetry subtasks, including pose estimation, depth prediction, and novel view synthesis using just the same model. Matrix3D utilizes a multi-modal diffusion transformer (DiT) to integrate transformations across several modalities, such as images, camera parameters, and depth maps. The key to Matrix3D's large-scale multi-modal training lies in the incorporation of a mask learning strategy. This enables full-modality model training even with partially complete data, such as bi-modality data of image-pose and image-depth pairs, thus significantly increases the pool of available training data. Matrix3D demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in pose estimation and novel view synthesis tasks. Additionally, it offers fine-grained control through multi-round interactions, making it an innovative tool for 3D content creation. Project page: https://nju-3dv.github.io/projects/matrix3d.

- **Summary**: In this technical report, we present Magic 1-For-1 (Magic141), an efficient video generation model with optimized memory consumption and inference latency. The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average. We conduct a series of preliminary explorations to find out the optimal tradeoff between computational cost and video quality during diffusion step distillation and hope this could be a good foundation model for open-source explorations.

- **Summary**: Egocentric visual query localization (EgoVQL) focuses on localizing the target of interest in space and time from first-person videos, given a visual query. Despite recent progressive, existing methods often struggle to handle severe object appearance changes and cluttering background in the video due to lacking sufficient target cues, leading to degradation. Addressing this, we introduce PRVQL, a novel Progressive knowledge-guided Refinement framework for EgoVQL. The core is to continuously exploit target-relevant knowledge directly from videos and utilize it as guidance to refine both query and video features for improving target localization. Our PRVQL contains multiple processing stages. The target knowledge from one stage, comprising appearance and spatial knowledge extracted via two specially designed knowledge learning modules, are utilized as guidance to refine the query and videos features for the next stage, which are used to generate more accurate knowledge for further feature refinement. With such a progressive process, target knowledge in PRVQL can be gradually improved, which, in turn, leads to better refined query and video features for localization in the final stage. Compared to previous methods, our PRVQL, besides the given object cues, enjoys additional crucial target information from a video as guidance to refine features, and hence enhances EgoVQL in complicated scenes. In our experiments on challenging Ego4D, PRVQL achieves state-of-the-art result and largely surpasses other methods, showing its efficacy. Our code, model and results will be released at https://github.com/fb-reps/PRVQL.

- **Summary**: Multimodal deep learning systems are deployed in dynamic scenarios due to the robustness afforded by multiple sensing modalities. Nevertheless, they struggle with varying compute resource availability (due to multi-tenancy, device heterogeneity, etc.) and fluctuating quality of inputs (from sensor feed corruption, environmental noise, etc.). Current multimodal systems employ static resource provisioning and cannot easily adapt when compute resources change over time. Additionally, their reliance on processing sensor data with fixed feature extractors is ill-equipped to handle variations in modality quality. Consequently, uninformative modalities, such as those with high noise, needlessly consume resources better allocated towards other modalities. We propose ADMN, a layer-wise Adaptive Depth Multimodal Network capable of tackling both challenges - it adjusts the total number of active layers across all modalities to meet compute resource constraints, and continually reallocates layers across input modalities according to their modality quality. Our evaluations showcase ADMN can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art networks while reducing up to 75% of their floating-point operations.

- **Summary**: Progress in AI has relied on human-generated data, from annotator marketplaces to the wider Internet. However, the widespread use of large language models now threatens the quality and integrity of human-generated data on these very platforms. We argue that this issue goes beyond the immediate challenge of filtering AI-generated content--it reveals deeper flaws in how data collection systems are designed. Existing systems often prioritize speed, scale, and efficiency at the cost of intrinsic human motivation, leading to declining engagement and data quality. We propose that rethinking data collection systems to align with contributors' intrinsic motivations--rather than relying solely on external incentives--can help sustain high-quality data sourcing at scale while maintaining contributor trust and long-term participation.

- **Summary**: Ear recognition is a contactless and unobtrusive biometric technique with applications across various domains. However, deploying high-performing ear recognition models on resource-constrained devices is challenging, limiting their applicability and widespread adoption. This paper introduces EdgeEar, a lightweight model based on a proposed hybrid CNN-transformer architecture to solve this problem. By incorporating low-rank approximations into specific linear layers, EdgeEar reduces its parameter count by a factor of 50 compared to the current state-of-the-art, bringing it below two million while maintaining competitive accuracy. Evaluation on the Unconstrained Ear Recognition Challenge (UERC2023) benchmark shows that EdgeEar achieves the lowest EER while significantly reducing computational costs. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of efficient and accurate ear recognition, which we believe will contribute to the wider adoption of ear biometrics.

- **Summary**: Next-Token Prediction (NTP) is a de facto approach for autoregressive (AR) video generation, but it suffers from suboptimal unidirectional dependencies and slow inference speed. In this work, we propose a semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation. By uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or frames), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks, allowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the corresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our framework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to capture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in parallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps, leading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores of 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an average of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps, the NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128x128 resolution) per second, achieving an 11x speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B parameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD scores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.

- **Summary**: The integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data is crucial for understanding gene expression in spatial context. Existing methods for such integration have limited performance, with structural similarity often below 60\%, We attribute this limitation to the failure to consider causal relationships between genes. We present CausalGeD, which combines diffusion and autoregressive processes to leverage these relationships. By generalizing the Causal Attention Transformer from image generation to gene expression data, our model captures regulatory mechanisms without predefined relationships. Across 10 tissue datasets, CausalGeD outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by 5- 32\% in key metrics, including Pearson's correlation and structural similarity, advancing both technical and biological insights.

- **Summary**: We demonstrate that discriminative models inherently contain powerful generative capabilities, challenging the fundamental distinction between discriminative and generative architectures. Our method, Direct Ascent Synthesis (DAS), reveals these latent capabilities through multi-resolution optimization of CLIP model representations. While traditional inversion attempts produce adversarial patterns, DAS achieves high-quality image synthesis by decomposing optimization across multiple spatial scales (1x1 to 224x224), requiring no additional training. This approach not only enables diverse applications -- from text-to-image generation to style transfer -- but maintains natural image statistics ($1/f^2$ spectrum) and guides the generation away from non-robust adversarial patterns. Our results demonstrate that standard discriminative models encode substantially richer generative knowledge than previously recognized, providing new perspectives on model interpretability and the relationship between adversarial examples and natural image synthesis.

- **Summary**: Gaussian Splatting (GS) is a recent and pivotal technique in 3D computer graphics. GS-based algorithms almost always bypass classical methods such as ray tracing, which offers numerous inherent advantages for rendering. For example, ray tracing is able to handle incoherent rays for advanced lighting effects, including shadows and reflections. To address this limitation, we introduce MeshSplats, a method which converts GS to a mesh-like format. Following the completion of training, MeshSplats transforms Gaussian elements into mesh faces, enabling rendering using ray tracing methods with all their associated benefits. Our model can be utilized immediately following transformation, yielding a mesh of slightly reduced quality without additional training. Furthermore, we can enhance the reconstruction quality through the application of a dedicated optimization algorithm that operates on mesh faces rather than Gaussian components. The efficacy of our method is substantiated by experimental results, underscoring its extensive applications in computer graphics and image processing.

- **Summary**: Hypercomplex image processing extends conventional techniques in a unified paradigm encompassing algebraic and geometric principles. This work leverages quaternions and the two-dimensional orthogonal planes split framework (splitting of a quaternion - representing a pixel - into pairs of orthogonal 2D planes) for natural/biomedical image analysis through the following computational workflows and outcomes: natural/biomedical image re-colorization, natural image de-colorization, natural/biomedical image contrast enhancement, computational re-staining and stain separation in histological images, and performance gains in machine/deep learning pipelines for histological images. The workflows are analyzed separately for natural and biomedical images to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The proposed workflows can regulate color appearance (e.g. with alternative renditions and grayscale conversion) and image contrast, be part of automated image processing pipelines (e.g. isolating stain components, boosting learning models), and assist in digital pathology applications (e.g. enhancing biomarker visibility, enabling colorblind-friendly renditions). Employing only basic arithmetic and matrix operations, this work offers a computationally accessible methodology - in the hypercomplex domain - that showcases versatility and consistency across image processing tasks and a range of computer vision and biomedical applications. The proposed non-data-driven methods achieve comparable or better results (particularly in cases involving well-known methods) to those reported in the literature, showcasing the potential of robust theoretical frameworks with practical effectiveness. Results, methods, and limitations are detailed alongside discussion of promising extensions, emphasizing the potential of feature-rich mathematical/computational frameworks for natural and biomedical images.

- **Summary**: Monocular egocentric 3D human motion capture remains a significant challenge, particularly under conditions of low lighting and fast movements, which are common in head-mounted device applications. Existing methods that rely on RGB cameras often fail under these conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce EventEgo3D++, the first approach that leverages a monocular event camera with a fisheye lens for 3D human motion capture. Event cameras excel in high-speed scenarios and varying illumination due to their high temporal resolution, providing reliable cues for accurate 3D human motion capture. EventEgo3D++ leverages the LNES representation of event streams to enable precise 3D reconstructions. We have also developed a mobile head-mounted device (HMD) prototype equipped with an event camera, capturing a comprehensive dataset that includes real event observations from both controlled studio environments and in-the-wild settings, in addition to a synthetic dataset. Additionally, to provide a more holistic dataset, we include allocentric RGB streams that offer different perspectives of the HMD wearer, along with their corresponding SMPL body model. Our experiments demonstrate that EventEgo3D++ achieves superior 3D accuracy and robustness compared to existing solutions, even in challenging conditions. Moreover, our method supports real-time 3D pose updates at a rate of 140Hz. This work is an extension of the EventEgo3D approach (CVPR 2024) and further advances the state of the art in egocentric 3D human motion capture.

- **Summary**: Detecting AI generated images is a challenging yet essential task. A primary difficulty arises from the detectors tendency to rely on spurious patterns, such as compression artifacts, which can influence its decisions. These issues often stem from specific patterns that the detector associates with the real data distribution, making it difficult to isolate the actual generative traces. We argue that an image should be classified as fake if and only if it contains artifacts introduced by the generative model. Based on this premise, we propose Stay Positive, an algorithm designed to constrain the detectors focus to generative artifacts while disregarding those associated with real data. Experimental results demonstrate that detectors trained with Stay Positive exhibit reduced susceptibility to spurious correlations, leading to improved generalization and robustness to post processing. Additionally, unlike detectors that associate artifacts with real images, those that focus purely on fake artifacts are better at detecting inpainted real images.

- **Summary**: Text-conditioned image generation has gained significant attention in recent years and are processing increasingly longer and comprehensive text prompt. In everyday life, dense and intricate text appears in contexts like advertisements, infographics, and signage, where the integration of both text and visuals is essential for conveying complex information. However, despite these advances, the generation of images containing long-form text remains a persistent challenge, largely due to the limitations of existing datasets, which often focus on shorter and simpler text. To address this gap, we introduce TextAtlas5M, a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate long-text rendering in text-conditioned image generation. Our dataset consists of 5 million long-text generated and collected images across diverse data types, enabling comprehensive evaluation of large-scale generative models on long-text image generation. We further curate 3000 human-improved test set TextAtlasEval across 3 data domains, establishing one of the most extensive benchmarks for text-conditioned generation. Evaluations suggest that the TextAtlasEval benchmarks present significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT4o with DallE-3), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. These evidences position TextAtlas5M as a valuable dataset for training and evaluating future-generation text-conditioned image generation models.

- **Summary**: Flag manifolds encode hierarchical nested sequences of subspaces and serve as powerful structures for various computer vision and machine learning applications. Despite their utility in tasks such as dimensionality reduction, motion averaging, and subspace clustering, current applications are often restricted to extracting flags using common matrix decomposition methods like the singular value decomposition. Here, we address the need for a general algorithm to factorize and work with hierarchical datasets. In particular, we propose a novel, flag-based method that decomposes arbitrary hierarchical real-valued data into a hierarchy-preserving flag representation in Stiefel coordinates. Our work harnesses the potential of flag manifolds in applications including denoising, clustering, and few-shot learning.

- **Summary**: We present MatSwap, a method to transfer materials to designated surfaces in an image photorealistically. Such a task is non-trivial due to the large entanglement of material appearance, geometry, and lighting in a photograph. In the literature, material editing methods typically rely on either cumbersome text engineering or extensive manual annotations requiring artist knowledge and 3D scene properties that are impractical to obtain. In contrast, we propose to directly learn the relationship between the input material -- as observed on a flat surface -- and its appearance within the scene, without the need for explicit UV mapping. To achieve this, we rely on a custom light- and geometry-aware diffusion model. We fine-tune a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model for material transfer using our synthetic dataset, preserving its strong priors to ensure effective generalization to real images. As a result, our method seamlessly integrates a desired material into the target location in the photograph while retaining the identity of the scene. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real images and show that it compares favorably to recent work both qualitatively and quantitatively. We will release our code and data upon publication.

- **Summary**: We present Pippo, a generative model capable of producing 1K resolution dense turnaround videos of a person from a single casually clicked photo. Pippo is a multi-view diffusion transformer and does not require any additional inputs - e.g., a fitted parametric model or camera parameters of the input image. We pre-train Pippo on 3B human images without captions, and conduct multi-view mid-training and post-training on studio captured humans. During mid-training, to quickly absorb the studio dataset, we denoise several (up to 48) views at low-resolution, and encode target cameras coarsely using a shallow MLP. During post-training, we denoise fewer views at high-resolution and use pixel-aligned controls (e.g., Spatial anchor and Plucker rays) to enable 3D consistent generations. At inference, we propose an attention biasing technique that allows Pippo to simultaneously generate greater than 5 times as many views as seen during training. Finally, we also introduce an improved metric to evaluate 3D consistency of multi-view generations, and show that Pippo outperforms existing works on multi-view human generation from a single image.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) represent the cutting edge of AI technology, with DeepSeek models emerging as a leading open-source alternative offering competitive performance to closed-source systems. While these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their vision-language integration mechanisms introduce specific vulnerabilities. We implement an adapted embedding manipulation attack on DeepSeek Janus that induces targeted visual hallucinations through systematic optimization of image embeddings. Through extensive experimentation across COCO, DALL-E 3, and SVIT datasets, we achieve hallucination rates of up to 98.0% while maintaining high visual fidelity (SSIM > 0.88) of the manipulated images on open-ended questions. Our analysis demonstrates that both 1B and 7B variants of DeepSeek Janus are susceptible to these attacks, with closed-form evaluation showing consistently higher hallucination rates compared to open-ended questioning. We introduce a novel multi-prompt hallucination detection framework using LLaMA-3.1 8B Instruct for robust evaluation. The implications of these findings are particularly concerning given DeepSeek's open-source nature and widespread deployment potential. This research emphasizes the critical need for embedding-level security measures in MLLM deployment pipelines and contributes to the broader discussion of responsible AI implementation.

- **Summary**: Surgical simulation offers a promising addition to conventional surgical training. However, available simulation tools lack photorealism and rely on hardcoded behaviour. Denoising Diffusion Models are a promising alternative for high-fidelity image synthesis, but existing state-of-the-art conditioning methods fall short in providing precise control or interactivity over the generated scenes.   We introduce SurGrID, a Scene Graph to Image Diffusion Model, allowing for controllable surgical scene synthesis by leveraging Scene Graphs. These graphs encode a surgical scene's components' spatial and semantic information, which are then translated into an intermediate representation using our novel pre-training step that explicitly captures local and global information.   Our proposed method improves the fidelity of generated images and their coherence with the graph input over the state-of-the-art. Further, we demonstrate the simulation's realism and controllability in a user assessment study involving clinical experts.   Scene Graphs can be effectively used for precise and interactive conditioning of Denoising Diffusion Models for simulating surgical scenes, enabling high fidelity and interactive control over the generated content.

- **Summary**: Employing self-supervised learning (SSL) methodologies assumes par-amount significance in handling unlabeled polyp datasets when building deep learning-based automatic polyp segmentation models. However, the intricate privacy dynamics surrounding medical data often preclude seamless data sharing among disparate medical centers. Federated learning (FL) emerges as a formidable solution to this privacy conundrum, yet within the realm of FL, optimizing model generalization stands as a pressing imperative. Robust generalization capabilities are imperative to ensure the model's efficacy across diverse geographical domains post-training on localized client datasets. In this paper, a Federated self-supervised Domain Generalization method is proposed to enhance the generalization capacity of federated and Label-efficient intestinal polyp segmentation, named LFDG. Based on a classical SSL method, DropPos, LFDG proposes an adversarial learning-based data augmentation method (SSADA) to enhance the data diversity. LFDG further proposes a relaxation module based on Source-reconstruction and Augmentation-masking (SRAM) to maintain stability in feature learning. We have validated LFDG on polyp images from six medical centers. The performance of our method achieves 3.80% and 3.92% better than the baseline and other recent FL methods and SSL methods, respectively.

- **Summary**: Cancers are characterized by remarkable heterogeneity and diverse prognosis. Accurate cancer classification is essential for patient stratification and clinical decision-making. Although digital pathology has been advancing cancer diagnosis and prognosis, the paradigm in cancer pathology has shifted from purely relying on histology features to incorporating molecular markers. There is an urgent need for digital pathology methods to meet the needs of the new paradigm. We introduce a novel digital pathology approach to jointly predict molecular markers and histology features and model their interactions for cancer classification. Firstly, to mitigate the challenge of cross-magnification information propagation, we propose a multi-scale disentangling module, enabling the extraction of multi-scale features from high-magnification (cellular-level) to low-magnification (tissue-level) whole slide images. Further, based on the multi-scale features, we propose an attention-based hierarchical multi-task multi-instance learning framework to simultaneously predict histology and molecular markers. Moreover, we propose a co-occurrence probability-based label correlation graph network to model the co-occurrence of molecular markers. Lastly, we design a cross-modal interaction module with the dynamic confidence constrain loss and a cross-modal gradient modulation strategy, to model the interactions of histology and molecular markers. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in classifying glioma, histology features and molecular markers. Our method promises to promote precise oncology with the potential to advance biomedical research and clinical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/LHY1007/M3C2

- **Summary**: Recent advances in one-step generative models typically follow a two-stage process: first training a teacher diffusion model and then distilling it into a one-step student model. This distillation process traditionally relies on both the teacher model's score function to compute the distillation loss and its weights for student initialization. In this paper, we explore whether one-step generative models can be trained directly without this distillation process. First, we show that the teacher's score function is not essential and propose a family of distillation methods that achieve competitive results without relying on score estimation. Next, we demonstrate that initialization from teacher weights is indispensable in successful training. Surprisingly, we find that this benefit is not due to improved ``input-output" mapping but rather the learned feature representations, which dominate distillation quality. Our findings provide a better understanding of the role of initialization in one-step model training and its impact on distillation quality.

- **Summary**: While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers rich spatial resolution, it is limited by high operational costs and significant infrastructural demands. In contrast, electroencephalography (EEG) provides millisecond-level precision in capturing electrical activity but lacks the spatial resolution necessary for precise neural localization. To bridge these gaps, we introduce E2fNet, a simple yet effective deep learning model for synthesizing fMRI images from low-cost EEG data. E2fNet is specifically designed to capture and translate meaningful features from EEG across electrode channels into accurate fMRI representations. Extensive evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that E2fNet consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of the structural similarity index measure (SSIM). Our findings suggest that E2fNet is a promising, cost-effective solution for enhancing neuroimaging capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/kgr20/E2fNet.
