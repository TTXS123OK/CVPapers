- **Summary**: We demonstrate that, under orthographic projection and with a camera fixated on a point located on a rigid body, the rotation of that body can be analytically obtained by tracking only one other feature in the image. With some exceptions, any tracked point, regardless of its location on the body, yields the same value of the instantaneous rotation rate.   The proposed method is independent of the shape of the 3D object and does not require a priori knowledge about the scene. This algorithm is suited for parallel processing and can achieve segmentation of the scene by distinguishing points that do not belong to the same rigid body, simply because they do not produce the same value of the rotation. This paper presents an analytical derivation, simulation results, and results from real video data.

- **Summary**: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

- **Summary**: Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a crucial problem in the realm of the virtual metaverse. Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this field with their strong generation capabilities. However, several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference and visual artifacts caused by the implicit latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which complicates the diffusion process; 2) a lack of authentic facial expressions and head movements due to inadequate multi-modal information fusion. In this paper, MoDA handles these challenges by: 1) defining a joint parameter space that bridges motion generation and neural rendering, and leveraging flow matching to simplify diffusion learning; 2) introducing a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, enhancing overall facial expressiveness. In addition, a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy is employed to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring effective feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MoDA improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result, these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene, i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to previous approaches.



### Investigating Redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models with Multiple Vision Encoders

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance, confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.

- **Summary**: The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a meaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on classification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data are two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To tackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with statistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this article. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature extractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is designed to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial information learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR covariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first dynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and pixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature interaction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the classification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected distillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of different frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency data. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher model to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to learn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of dual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on four measured dual-frequency PolSAR data demonstrate that the proposed SKDNet-SSR outperforms other related methods.

- **Summary**: Small vibrations observed in video can unveil information beyond what is visual, such as sound and material properties. It is possible to passively record these vibrations when they are visually perceptible, or actively amplify their visual contribution with a laser beam when they are not perceptible. In this paper, we improve upon the active sensing approach by leveraging event-based cameras, which are designed to efficiently capture fast motion. We demonstrate our method experimentally by recovering audio from vibrations, even for multiple simultaneous sources, and in the presence of environmental distortions. Our approach matches the state-of-the-art reconstruction quality at much faster speeds, approaching real-time processing.

- **Summary**: Current text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks evaluate models on rigid prompts, potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks systematically underestimate model performance in these categories. Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts, indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models. These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more accurate assessment and insights for future development.

- **Summary**: Machine unlearning (MUL) refers to the problem of making a pre-trained model selectively forget some training instances or class(es) while retaining performance on the remaining dataset. Existing MUL research involves fine-tuning using a forget and/or retain set, making it expensive and/or impractical, and often causing performance degradation in the unlearned model. We introduce {\pname}, an unlearning-aware vision transformer-based architecture that can directly perform unlearning for future unlearning requests without any fine-tuning over the requested set. The proposed model is trained by simulating unlearning during the training process itself. It involves randomly separating class(es)/sub-class(es) present in each mini-batch into two disjoint sets: a proxy forget-set and a retain-set, and the model is optimized so that it is unable to predict the forget-set. Forgetting is achieved by withdrawing keys, making unlearning on-the-fly and avoiding performance degradation. The model is trained jointly with learnable keys and original weights, ensuring withholding a key irreversibly erases information, validated by membership inference attack scores. Extensive experiments on various datasets, architectures, and resolutions confirm {\pname}'s superiority over both fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods.

- **Summary**: Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in computational chemistry with critical applications in drug discovery and materials science. While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance.

- **Summary**: One practical approach to infer 3D scene structure from a single image is to retrieve a closely matching 3D model from a database and align it with the object in the image. Existing methods rely on supervised training with images and pose annotations, which limits them to a narrow set of object categories. To address this, we propose a weakly supervised 9-DoF alignment method for inexact 3D models that requires no pose annotations and generalizes to unseen categories. Our approach derives a novel feature space based on foundation features that ensure multi-view consistency and overcome symmetry ambiguities inherent in foundation features using a self-supervised triplet loss. Additionally, we introduce a texture-invariant pose refinement technique that performs dense alignment in normalized object coordinates, estimated through the enhanced feature space. We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world ScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised baselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised approach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%. To assess generalization, we introduce SUN2CAD, a real-world test set with 20 novel object categories, where our method achieves SOTA results without prior training on them.

- **Summary**: Gastrointestinal malignancies constitute a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage prognosis remaining particularly dismal. Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative paradigms for surgical phase recognition.

- **Summary**: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However, traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey aims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers and seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.

- **Summary**: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images) or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution (OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and (2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU, respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/wooseok-shin/SemiOVS

- **Summary**: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enhance model robustness in unseen or distributionally shifted target domains through training exclusively on source domains. Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning strategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they predominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous multi-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key challenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling models trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target distributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences between modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG typically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness during generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to consider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each modality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent generalization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired modalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling synchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally, we introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates modal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment of unified representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization.

- **Summary**: Multi-camera systems are increasingly vital in the environmental perception of autonomous vehicles and robotics. Their physical configuration offers inherent fixed relative pose constraints that benefit Structure-from-Motion (SfM). However, traditional global SfM systems struggle with robustness due to their optimization framework. We propose a novel global motion averaging framework for multi-camera systems, featuring two core components: a decoupled rotation averaging module and a hybrid translation averaging module. Our rotation averaging employs a hierarchical strategy by first estimating relative rotations within rigid camera units and then computing global rigid unit rotations. To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate both camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera positions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and refine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds incremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency. Our framework outperforms existing global SfM methods, establishing itself as a robust solution for real-world multi-camera SfM applications.

- **Summary**: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI. This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) - structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) based methods have received extensive and sufficient attention in the field of PolSAR image classification, which show excellent performance. However, due to the ``black-box" nature of DL methods, the interpretation of the high-dimensional features extracted and the backtracking of the decision-making process based on the features are still unresolved problems. In this study, we first highlight this issue and attempt to achieve the interpretability analysis of DL-based PolSAR image classification technology with the help of Polarimetric Target Decomposition (PTD), a feature extraction method related to the scattering mechanism unique to the PolSAR image processing field. In our work, by constructing the polarimetric conceptual labels and a novel structure named Parallel Concept Bottleneck Networks (PaCBM), the uninterpretable high-dimensional features are transformed into human-comprehensible concepts based on physically verifiable polarimetric scattering mechanisms. Then, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is used to replace Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for achieving a more concise and understandable mapping process between layers and further enhanced non-linear modeling ability. The experimental results on several PolSAR datasets show that the features could be conceptualization under the premise of achieving satisfactory accuracy through the proposed pipeline, and the analytical function for predicting category labels from conceptual labels can be obtained by combining spline functions, thus promoting the research on the interpretability of the DL-based PolSAR image classification model.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information, such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA), which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases. In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017, Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art approaches, respectively.

- **Summary**: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained images are commonly used to detect nuclear or cancerous regions in cells from images captured by a microscope. Identifying cancer cytoplasm is crucial for determining the type of cancer; hence, obtaining accurate cancer cytoplasm regions in cell images is important. While CMOS images often lack detailed information necessary for diagnosis, hyperspectral images provide more comprehensive cell information. Using a deep learning model, we propose a method for detecting cancer cell cytoplasm in hyperspectral images. Deep learning models require large datasets for learning; however, capturing a large number of hyperspectral images is difficult. Additionally, hyperspectral images frequently contain instrumental noise, depending on the characteristics of the imaging devices. We propose a data augmentation method to account for instrumental noise. CMOS images were used for data augmentation owing to their visual clarity, which facilitates manual annotation compared to original hyperspectral images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation method both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Recent generative models such as GPT-4o have shown strong capabilities in producing high-quality images with accurate text rendering. However, commercial design tasks like advertising banners demand more than visual fidelity -- they require structured layouts, precise typography, consistent branding, and more. In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality. Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input, MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing diffusion and LLM-based baselines in real-world banner design scenarios.

- **Summary**: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing, object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173 instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models, and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive cooking systems.

- **Summary**: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets, dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field. However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance on other downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent privacy protection.

- **Summary**: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets (i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Functional ultrasound (fUS) is a neuroimaging technique known for its high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling non-invasive observation of brain activity through neurovascular coupling. Despite its potential in clinical applications such as neonatal monitoring and intraoperative guidance, the development of fUS faces challenges related to data scarcity and limitations in generating realistic fUS images. This paper explores the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework tailored for fUS image synthesis. The proposed method incorporates architectural enhancements, including feature enhancement modules and normalization techniques, aiming to improve the fidelity and physiological plausibility of generated images. The study evaluates the performance of the framework against existing generative models, demonstrating its capability to produce high-quality fUS images under various experimental conditions. Additionally, the synthesized images are assessed for their utility in downstream tasks, showing improvements in classification accuracy when used for data augmentation. Experimental results are based on publicly available fUS datasets, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in addressing data limitations.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years, newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that, we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

- **Summary**: Hardware accelerators are essential for achieving low-latency, energy-efficient inference in edge applications like image recognition. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are particularly promising due to their event-driven and temporally sparse nature, making them well-suited for low-power Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based deployment. This paper explores using the open-source Spiker+ framework to generate optimized SNNs accelerators for handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset. Spiker+ enables high-level specification of network topologies, neuron models, and quantization, automatically generating deployable HDL. We evaluate multiple configurations and analyze trade-offs relevant to edge computing constraints.

- **Summary**: In modern electronic manufacturing, defect detection on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) plays a critical role in ensuring product yield and maintaining the reliability of downstream assembly processes. However, existing methods often suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and insufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that hinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and efficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built upon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation capability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This module improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual structure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture fine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational power of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy caused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive Screening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and aggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level semantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant computations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection accuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data, particularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality dataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources. Our dataset not only supports the training and evaluation of our proposed framework but also serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the challenge of procedure planning in instructional videos, aiming to generate coherent and task-aligned action sequences from start and end visual observations. Previous work has mainly relied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and unobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal relationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features, thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally, we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action sequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on most metrics.

- **Summary**: Estimating normals for noisy point clouds is a persistent challenge in 3D geometry processing, particularly for end-to-end oriented normal estimation. Existing methods generally address relatively clean data and rely on supervised priors to fit local surfaces within specific neighborhoods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning normals from noisy point clouds through local gradient-aware surface filtering. Our method projects noisy points onto the underlying surface by utilizing normals and distances derived from an implicit function constrained by local gradients. We start by introducing a distance measurement operator for global surface fitting on noisy data, which integrates projected distances along normals. Following this, we develop an implicit field-based filtering approach for surface point construction, adding projection constraints on these points during filtering. To address issues of over-smoothing and gradient degradation, we further incorporate local gradient consistency constraints, as well as local gradient orientation and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and point cloud denoising demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

- **Summary**: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility (coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star, a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest, etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics (Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men, and accurate identification of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) is critical for timely intervention. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is widely used for prostate biopsy; however, its low contrast and anisotropic spatial resolution pose diagnostic challenges. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid-view attention (HVA) network for csPCa classification in 3D TRUS that leverages complementary information from transverse and sagittal views. Our approach integrates a CNN-transformer hybrid architecture, where convolutional layers extract fine-grained local features and transformer-based HVA models global dependencies. Specifically, the HVA comprises intra-view attention to refine features within a single view and cross-view attention to incorporate complementary information across views. Furthermore, a hybrid-view adaptive fusion module dynamically aggregates features along both channel and spatial dimensions, enhancing the overall representation. Experiments are conducted on an in-house dataset containing 590 subjects who underwent prostate biopsy. Comparative and ablation results prove the efficacy of our method.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance (EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions, effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE), and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its suitability for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Existing defense methods fail to defend against unknown attacks and thus raise generalization issue of adversarial robustness. To remedy this problem, we attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various attacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low entropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on the universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is elaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower entropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark contrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct existing test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach: Rectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial rectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with clean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified with low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating their adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly classified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward minimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization scheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware weighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy objectives. Experiments on several datasets show that REAL can greatly improve the performance of existing sample rectification models.

- **Summary**: The data appetite for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has continuously scaled up from the early millions to billions today, which faces an untenable trade-off with data quality and inevitably introduces Noisy Correspondence (NC) samples. Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs the performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by estimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such resource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet realistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that seeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs. Specifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning framework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned noisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information, which can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and false negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one unified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our approach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks. Remarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer while with lower computational overhead. The code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Robots and autonomous vehicles should be aware of what happens in their surroundings. The segmentation and tracking of moving objects are essential for reliable path planning, including collision avoidance. We investigate this estimation task for vehicles using radar sensing. We address moving instance tracking in sparse radar point clouds to enhance scene interpretation. We propose a learning-based radar tracker incorporating temporal offset predictions to enable direct center-based association and enhance segmentation performance by including additional motion cues. We implement attention-based tracking for sparse radar scans to include appearance features and enhance performance. The final association combines geometric and appearance features to overcome the limitations of center-based tracking to associate instances reliably. Our approach shows an improved performance on the moving instance tracking benchmark of the RadarScenes dataset compared to the current state of the art.

- **Summary**: Despite significant progress in designing powerful adversarial evasion attacks for robustness verification, the evaluation of these methods often remains inconsistent and unreliable. Many assessments rely on mismatched models, unverified implementations, and uneven computational budgets, which can lead to biased results and a false sense of security. Consequently, robustness claims built on such flawed testing protocols may be misleading and give a false sense of security. As a concrete step toward improving evaluation reliability, we present AttackBench, a benchmark framework developed to assess the effectiveness of gradient-based attacks under standardized and reproducible conditions. AttackBench serves as an evaluation tool that ranks existing attack implementations based on a novel optimality metric, which enables researchers and practitioners to identify the most reliable and effective attack for use in subsequent robustness evaluations. The framework enforces consistent testing conditions and enables continuous updates, making it a reliable foundation for robustness verification.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics. Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple, effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis. By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot, few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.

- **Summary**: The awareness about moving objects in the surroundings of a self-driving vehicle is essential for safe and reliable autonomous navigation. The interpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but typically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in order to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are already installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they directly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate instantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper, we tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point clouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance scene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify moving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform single-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The key to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity information throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise segmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a transformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively combining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse point clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation benchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other state-of-the-art methods. Our network runs faster than the frame rate of the sensor and shows superior segmentation results using only single-scan radar data.

- **Summary**: Image quality assessment (IQA) is crucial in the evaluation stage of novel algorithms operating on images, including traditional and machine learning based methods. Due to the lack of available quality-rated medical images, most commonly used IQA methods employing reference images (i.e. full-reference IQA) have been developed and tested for natural images. Reported application inconsistencies arising when employing such measures for medical images are not surprising, as they rely on different properties than natural images. In photoacoustic imaging (PAI), especially, standard benchmarking approaches for assessing the quality of image reconstructions are lacking. PAI is a multi-physics imaging modality, in which two inverse problems have to be solved, which makes the application of IQA measures uniquely challenging due to both, acoustic and optical, artifacts.   To support the development and testing of full- and no-reference IQA measures we assembled PhotIQA, a data set consisting of 1134 reconstructed photoacoustic (PA) images that were rated by 2 experts across five quality properties (overall quality, edge visibility, homogeneity, inclusion and background intensity), where the detailed rating enables usage beyond PAI. To allow full-reference assessment, highly characterised imaging test objects were used, providing a ground truth. Our baseline experiments show that HaarPSI$_{med}$ significantly outperforms SSIM in correlating with the quality ratings (SRCC: 0.83 vs. 0.62). The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13325196.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions. This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this domain.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video, image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines, with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to robustness and performance.

- **Summary**: Digital pathology has seen the advent of a wealth of foundational models (FM), yet to date their performance on cell phenotyping has not been benchmarked in a unified manner. We therefore propose PhenoBench: A comprehensive benchmark for cell phenotyping on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained histopathology images. We provide both PhenoCell, a new H&E dataset featuring 14 granular cell types identified by using multiplexed imaging, and ready-to-use fine-tuning and benchmarking code that allows the systematic evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as Lizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20. This indicates a much more challenging task not captured by previous benchmarks, establishing PhenoCell as a prime asset for future benchmarking of FMs and supervised models alike. Code and data are available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised action segmentation has recently pushed its limits with ASOT, an optimal transport (OT)-based method that simultaneously learns action representations and performs clustering using pseudo-labels. Unlike other OT-based approaches, ASOT makes no assumptions about action ordering and can decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy cost matrix between video frames and action labels. However, the resulting segmentation lacks segment-level supervision, limiting the effectiveness of feedback between frames and action representations. To address this limitation, we propose Closed Loop Optimal Transport (CLOT), a novel OT-based framework with a multi-level cyclic feature learning mechanism. Leveraging its encoder-decoder architecture, CLOT learns pseudo-labels alongside frame and segment embeddings by solving two separate OT problems. It then refines both frame embeddings and pseudo-labels through cross-attention between the learned frame and segment embeddings, by integrating a third OT problem. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the benefits of cyclical learning for unsupervised action segmentation.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, GPT-4o, Grok-4) compare against a domain-specific face recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task? Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and benchmark datasets, we report the following findings: (a) In all face benchmark datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improved on over-segmented face images compared to tightly cropped faces, thereby suggesting the importance of contextual clues. (c) A simple score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific face recognition model improved the accuracy at low false match rates. (d) Foundation models, such as GPT-4o and Grok-4, are able to provide explainability to the face recognition pipeline. In some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence decisions made by AdaFace, thereby reiterating the importance of combining domain-specific face recognition models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

- **Summary**: Text-based visual descriptors--ranging from simple class names to more descriptive phrases--are widely used in visual concept discovery and image classification with vision-language models (VLMs). Their effectiveness, however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity, presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and (2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation alignment and language understanding, we introduce two alignment-based metrics--Global Alignment and CLIP Similarity--that move beyond accuracy. These metrics shed light on how different descriptor generation strategies interact with foundation model properties, offering new ways to study descriptor effectiveness beyond accuracy evaluations.

- **Summary**: Brain stroke is a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, underscoring the need for precise and rapid prediction techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. Most stroke classification techniques use a single slice-level prediction mechanism, requiring radiologists to manually select the most critical CT slice from the original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques, this study investigates machine learning models for early brain stroke prediction using CT scan images. This research proposes a novel machine learning approach to brain stroke detection, focusing on optimizing classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are used for feature extraction. Feature engineering techniques, including BFO, PCA, and LDA, further enhance model performance. These features are then classified using machine learning algorithms, including SVC, RF, XGB, DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of 97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Pavement skid resistance is of vital importance for road safety. The objective of this study is to propose and validate a texture-based image indicator to predict pavement friction. This index enables pavement friction to be measured easily and inexpensively using digital images. Three different types of asphalt surfaces (dense-graded asphalt mix, open-grade friction course, and chip seal) were evaluated subject to various tire polishing cycles. Images were taken with corresponding friction measured using Dynamic Friction Tester (DFT) in the laboratory. The aggregate protrusion area is proposed as the indicator. Statistical models are established for each asphalt surface type to correlate the proposed indicator with friction coefficients. The results show that the adjusted R-square values of all relationships are above 0.90. Compared to other image-based indicators in the literature, the proposed image indicator more accurately reflects the changes in pavement friction with the number of polishing cycles, proving its cost-effective use for considering pavement friction in mix design stage.

- **Summary**: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage, supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a 2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse lighting and weather conditions.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single, pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five *Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior, and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid to facilitate further research in the development of ViFMs.

- **Summary**: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains. This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder, incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9% of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

- **Summary**: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy. Beyond classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in real-world clinical settings.

- **Summary**: Text-guided image manipulation with diffusion models enables flexible and precise editing based on prompts, but raises ethical and copyright concerns due to potential unauthorized modifications. To address this, we propose SecureT2I, a secure framework designed to prevent unauthorized editing in diffusion-based generative models. SecureT2I is compatible with both general-purpose and domain-specific models and can be integrated via lightweight fine-tuning without architectural changes. We categorize images into a permit set and a forbid set based on editing permissions. For the permit set, the model learns to perform high-quality manipulations as usual. For the forbid set, we introduce training objectives that encourage vague or semantically ambiguous outputs (e.g., blurred images), thereby suppressing meaningful edits. The core challenge is to block unauthorized editing while preserving editing quality for permitted inputs. To this end, we design separate loss functions that guide selective editing behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models show that SecureT2I effectively degrades manipulation quality on forbidden images while maintaining performance on permitted ones. We also evaluate generalization to unseen inputs and find that SecureT2I consistently outperforms baselines. Additionally, we analyze different vagueness strategies and find that resize-based degradation offers the best trade-off for secure manipulation control.

- **Summary**: Continual learning in medical image segmentation involves sequential data acquisition across diverse domains (e.g., clinical sites), where task interference between past and current domains often leads to catastrophic forgetting. Existing continual learning methods fail to capture the complex dependencies between tasks. We introduce a novel framework that mitigates forgetting by establishing and enhancing complex dependencies between historical data and the network in the present task. Our framework features a dual-alignment strategy, the cross-network alignment (CNA) module aligns the features extracted from the bottleneck layers of the current and previous networks, respectively, while the cross-representation alignment (CRA) module aligns the features learned by the current network from historical buffered data and current input data, respectively. Implementing both types of alignment is a non-trivial task. To address this, we further analyze the linear and nonlinear forms of the well-established Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) and deliberately design feature mapping and feature pairing blocks within the CRA module. Experiments on medical image segmentation task demonstrate our framework's effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting under domain shifts.



### Segmentation of separated Lumens in 3D CTA images of Aortic Dissection

- **Summary**: Aortic dissection is a serious pathology and requires an emergency management. It is characterized by one or more tears of the intimal wall of the normal blood duct of the aorta (true lumen); the blood under pressure then creates a second blood lumen (false lumen) in the media tissue. The two lumens are separated by an intimal wall, called flap. From the segmentation of connected lumens (more precisely, blood inside lumens) of an aortic dissection 3D Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) image, our previous studies allow us to retrieve the intimal flap by using Mathematical Morphology operators, and characterize intimal tears by 3d thin surfaces that fill them, these surfaces are obtained by operating the Aktouf et al. closing algorithm proposed in the framework of Digital Topology. Indeed, intimal tears are 3D holes in the intimal flap; although it is impossible to directly segment such non-concrete data, it is nevertheless possible to "materialize" them with these 3D filling surfaces that may be quantified or make easier the visualization of these holes.   In this paper, we use these surfaces that fill tears to cut connections between lumens in order to separate them.   This is the first time that surfaces filling tears are used as an image processing operator (to disconnect several parts of a 3D object). This lumen separation allows us to provide one of the first cartographies of an aortic dissection, that may better visually assist physicians during their diagnosis.   Our method is able to disconnect lumens, that may also lead to enhance several current investigations (registration, segmentation, hemodynamics).

- **Summary**: With the increasing attention to pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), \eg, CLIP, substantial efforts have been devoted to many downstream tasks, especially in test-time adaptation (TTA). However, previous works focus on learning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the ambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual prototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in limited performance. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ProtoMM}, a training-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs during the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over the textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to combine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More importantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream flows. This allows our multimodal prototypes to continually learn from the data, enhancing their generalizability in unseen scenarios. In addition, we quantify the importance of the prototypes and test images by formulating their semantic distance as an optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on 15 zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a 1.03\% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its variant datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces TACTIC-GRAPHS, a system that combines spectral graph theory and multimodal graph neural reasoning for semantic understanding and threat detection in tactical video under high noise and weak structure. The framework incorporates spectral embedding, temporal causal edge modeling, and discriminative path inference across heterogeneous modalities. A semantic-aware keyframe extraction method fuses visual, acoustic, and action cues to construct temporal graphs. Using graph attention and Laplacian spectral mapping, the model performs cross-modal weighting and causal signal analysis. Experiments on TACTIC-AVS and TACTIC-Voice datasets show 89.3 percent accuracy in temporal alignment and over 85 percent recognition of complete threat chains, with node latency within plus-minus 150 milliseconds. The approach enhances structural interpretability and supports applications in surveillance, defense, and intelligent security systems.

- **Summary**: We study whether visual embedding models capture continuous, ordinal attributes along linear directions, which we term _rank axes_. We define a model as _rankable_ for an attribute if projecting embeddings onto such an axis preserves the attribute's order. Across 7 popular encoders and 9 datasets with attributes like age, crowd count, head pose, aesthetics, and recency, we find that many embeddings are inherently rankable. Surprisingly, a small number of samples, or even just two extreme examples, often suffice to recover meaningful rank axes, without full-scale supervision. These findings open up new use cases for image ranking in vector databases and motivate further study into the structure and learning of rankable embeddings. Our code is available at https://github.com/aktsonthalia/rankable-vision-embeddings.

- **Summary**: Recent "segment anything" efforts show promise by learning from large-scale data, but adapting such models directly to medical images remains challenging due to the complexity of medical data, noisy annotations, and continual learning requirements across diverse modalities and anatomical structures. In this work, we propose SAMed-2, a new foundation model for medical image segmentation built upon the SAM-2 architecture. Specifically, we introduce a temporal adapter into the image encoder to capture image correlations and a confidence-driven memory mechanism to store high-certainty features for later retrieval. This memory-based strategy counters the pervasive noise in large-scale medical datasets and mitigates catastrophic forgetting when encountering new tasks or modalities. To train and evaluate SAMed-2, we curate MedBank-100k, a comprehensive dataset spanning seven imaging modalities and 21 medical segmentation tasks. Our experiments on both internal benchmarks and 10 external datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in multi-task scenarios. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhilingYan/Medical-SAM-Bench.

- **Summary**: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

- **Summary**: Existing pre-impact fall detection systems have high accuracy, however they are either intrusive to the subject or require heavy computational resources for fall detection, resulting in prohibitive deployment costs. These factors limit the global adoption of existing fall detection systems. In this work we present a Pre-impact fall detection system that is both non-intrusive and computationally efficient at deployment. Our system utilizes video data of the locality available through cameras, thereby requiring no specialized equipment to be worn by the subject. Further, the fall detection system utilizes minimal fall specific features and simplistic neural network models, designed to reduce the computational cost of the system. A minimal set of fall specific features are derived from the skeletal data, post observing the relative position of human skeleton during fall. These features are shown to have different distributions for Fall and non-fall scenarios proving their discriminative capability. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based network is selected and the network architecture and training parameters are designed after evaluation of performance on standard datasets. In the Pre-impact fall detection system the computation requirement is about 18 times lesser than existing modules with a comparable accuracy of 88%. Given the low computation requirements and higher accuracy levels, the proposed system is suitable for wider adoption in engineering systems related to industrial and residential safety.

- **Summary**: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges. We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components, SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances. Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.

- **Summary**: We present 3D PixBrush, a method for performing image-driven edits of local regions on 3D meshes. 3D PixBrush predicts a localization mask and a synthesized texture that faithfully portray the object in the reference image. Our predicted localizations are both globally coherent and locally precise. Globally - our method contextualizes the object in the reference image and automatically positions it onto the input mesh. Locally - our method produces masks that conform to the geometry of the reference image. Notably, our method does not require any user input (in the form of scribbles or bounding boxes) to achieve accurate localizations. Instead, our method predicts a localization mask on the 3D mesh from scratch. To achieve this, we propose a modification to the score distillation sampling technique which incorporates both the predicted localization and the reference image, referred to as localization-modulated image guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique on a wide variety of meshes and images.

- **Summary**: Fourier ptychography (FP) is a powerful light-based synthetic aperture imaging technique that allows one to reconstruct a high-resolution, wide field-of-view image by computationally integrating a diverse collection of low-resolution, far-field measurements. Typically, FP measurement diversity is introduced by changing the angle of the illumination or the position of the camera; either approach results in sampling different portions of the target's spatial frequency content, but both approaches introduce substantial costs and complexity to the acquisition process. In this work, we introduce Inverse Synthetic Aperture Fourier Ptychography, a novel approach to FP that foregoes changing the illumination angle or camera position and instead generates measurement diversity through target motion. Critically, we also introduce a novel learning-based method for estimating k-space coordinates from dual plane intensity measurements, thereby enabling synthetic aperture imaging without knowing the rotation of the target. We experimentally validate our method in simulation and on a tabletop optical system.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM due to its high-fidelity and real-time novel view synthesis performance. However, some previous 3DGS SLAM methods employ a differentiable rendering pipeline for tracking, lack geometric priors in outdoor scenes. Other approaches introduce separate tracking modules, but they accumulate errors with significant camera movement, leading to scale drift. To address these challenges, we propose a robust RGB-only outdoor 3DGS SLAM method: S3PO-GS. Technically, we establish a self-consistent tracking module anchored in the 3DGS pointmap, which avoids cumulative scale drift and achieves more precise and robust tracking with fewer iterations. Additionally, we design a patch-based pointmap dynamic mapping module, which introduces geometric priors while avoiding scale ambiguity. This significantly enhances tracking accuracy and the quality of scene reconstruction, making it particularly suitable for complex outdoor environments. Our experiments on the Waymo, KITTI, and DL3DV datasets demonstrate that S3PO-GS achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and outperforms other 3DGS SLAM methods in tracking accuracy.

- **Summary**: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs) promise efficient few-step generation but face significant challenges with training instability. We argue this instability stems from a fundamental conflict: by training a network to learn only a shortcut across a probability flow, the model loses its grasp on the instantaneous velocity field that defines the flow. Our solution is to explicitly anchor the model in the underlying flow during training. We introduce the Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM), a simple but effective training strategy that uses a Flow Matching (FM) task as an anchor for the primary CM shortcut objective. This Flow-Anchoring approach requires no architectural modifications and is broadly compatible with standard model architectures. By distilling a pre-trained LightningDiT model, our method achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.32 with two steps (NFE=2) and 1.76 with just one step (NFE=1) on ImageNet 256x256, significantly outperforming previous methods. This provides a general and effective recipe for building high-performance, few-step generative models. Our code and pretrained models: https://github.com/ali-vilab/FACM.

- **Summary**: The global demand for radiologists is increasing rapidly due to a growing reliance on medical imaging services, while the supply of radiologists is not keeping pace. Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies present significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists' capabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs), particularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the primary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel, vision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into a format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT, a deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to classify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The ViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with engineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and localization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning techniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method achieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR dataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by generating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline several task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for scenarios radiologists might encounter. Overall, this framework offers an assistive tool that can lighten radiologists' workload by providing preliminary findings and regions of interest to facilitate their diagnostic process.

- **Summary**: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive generation, and video-to-video.

- **Summary**: Event cameras have recently been introduced into image semantic segmentation, owing to their high temporal resolution and other advantageous properties. However, existing event-based semantic segmentation methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary information provided by frames and events, resulting in complex training strategies and increased computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient hybrid framework for image semantic segmentation, comprising a Spiking Neural Network branch for events and an Artificial Neural Network branch for frames. Specifically, we introduce three specialized modules to facilitate the interaction between these two branches: the Adaptive Temporal Weighting (ATW) Injector, the Event-Driven Sparse (EDS) Injector, and the Channel Selection Fusion (CSF) module. The ATW Injector dynamically integrates temporal features from event data into frame features, enhancing segmentation accuracy by leveraging critical dynamic temporal information. The EDS Injector effectively combines sparse event data with rich frame features, ensuring precise temporal and spatial information alignment. The CSF module selectively merges these features to optimize segmentation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across the DDD17-Seg, DSEC-Semantic, and M3ED-Semantic datasets but also significantly reduces energy consumption, achieving a 65\% reduction on the DSEC-Semantic dataset.

- **Summary**: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve self-supervised learning models robustness.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance over Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various vision-related tasks such as classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their use of self-attention mechanisms. As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected, affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets. Code will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models' capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

- **Summary**: Interactive time-varying volume visualization is challenging due to its complex spatiotemporal features and sheer size of the dataset. Recent works transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression, rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However, training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash, a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the time-varying neural representation.
