- **Summary**: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover, designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation, which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to the development of AI for Science.

- **Summary**: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood. We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution, synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using real data alone.

- **Summary**: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention. To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures, achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

- **Summary**: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving. However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need additional data and significant computational resources. To address these issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame 3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally, we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

- **Summary**: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement, overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal. Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

- **Summary**: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of 90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version will appear in the official conference proceedings.

- **Summary**: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch) with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches. In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method.

- **Summary**: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles. Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement. This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater challenges. Extensive experiments show that MAC-Lookup excels in enhancing underwater images by restoring details and colors better than existing methods.

- **Summary**: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

- **Summary**: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo (Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations, and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while maintaining strong performance.

- **Summary**: The importance of rapid and accurate histologic analysis of surgical tissue in the operating room has been recognized for over a century. Our standard-of-care intraoperative pathology workflow is based on light microscopy and H\&E histology, which is slow, resource-intensive, and lacks real-time digital imaging capabilities. Here, we present an emerging and innovative method for intraoperative histologic analysis, called Intelligent Histology, that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with stimulated Raman histology (SRH). SRH is a rapid, label-free, digital imaging method for real-time microscopic tumor tissue analysis. SRH generates high-resolution digital images of surgical specimens within seconds, enabling AI-driven tumor histologic analysis, molecular classification, and tumor infiltration detection. We review the scientific background, clinical translation, and future applications of intelligent histology in tumor neurosurgery. We focus on the major scientific and clinical studies that have demonstrated the transformative potential of intelligent histology across multiple neurosurgical specialties, including neurosurgical oncology, skull base, spine oncology, pediatric tumors, and periperal nerve tumors. Future directions include the development of AI foundation models through multi-institutional datasets, incorporating clinical and radiologic data for multimodal learning, and predicting patient outcomes. Intelligent histology represents a transformative intraoperative workflow that can reinvent real-time tumor analysis for 21st century neurosurgery.

- **Summary**: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM) and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

- **Summary**: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful, acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically, CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss (resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning. Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically, ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features, enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$, LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods across diverse datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image. However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions. Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

- **Summary**: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3) providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/dohoonkim-ai/DoMIX.

- **Summary**: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change, a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

- **Summary**: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i) spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

- **Summary**: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid adaptation.   We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.   To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift, maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary continual learning environments.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress, reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation, confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully exploit or integrate.



### MAGIC: Mask-Guided Diffusion Inpainting with Multi-Level Perturbations and Context-Aware Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Generation

- **Summary**: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly tasks.

- **Summary**: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions: Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that measurably improve TVR outcomes.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps. Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents, enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++, InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning methods (e.g., edges, depth).

- **Summary**: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs). Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms, Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms (FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and sustainability of rice farming.

- **Summary**: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations. An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of performance on a bifurcation detection task.

- **Summary**: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining detection accuracy, improving computational efficiency. Subsequently, an improved SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism is introduced to further enhance the model's feature extraction capability, enabling more precise identification of disease characteristics. Extensive experiments, including ablation studies and comparative evaluations, are conducted on a self-constructed shrimp disease dataset, with generalization tests extended to the URPC2020 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5 of 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms other lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model size. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency, providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in shrimp aquaculture.

- **Summary**: Vanilla autoregressive image generation models generate visual tokens step-by-step, limiting their ability to capture holistic relationships among token sequences. Moreover, because most visual tokenizers map local image patches into latent tokens, global information is limited. To address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens. Hita incorporates two key strategies to better align with the AR generation process: 1) {arranging} a sequential structure with holistic tokens at the beginning, followed by patch-level tokens, and using causal attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) adopting a lightweight fusion module before feeding the de-quantized tokens into the decoder to control information flow and prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID} and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. Detailed analysis of the holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image properties, such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

- **Summary**: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging. Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application. In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes.

This system aims to enhance safety measures in railway environments by providing real-time alerts for any detected human presence close to the track. The integration of a functionality to identify objects at a longer distance further fortifies the preventative capabilities of the system. With a precise focus on real-time object detection, this method is poised to deliver significant contributions to the existing technologies in railway safety. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a comprehensive evaluation, yielding a remarkable improvement in accuracy over existing methods. These results underscore the potential of this approach to revolutionize safety measures in railway environments, providing a substantial contribution to accident prevention strategies.

- **Summary**: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures, precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence, extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation. Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.

- **Summary**: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However, existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives. First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations, water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second, to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates, resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and prompt engineering will be released publicly.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity. Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability, making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

- **Summary**: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

- **Summary**: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

- **Summary**: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations, as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to that of fully supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision across all downstream tasks. The code is available here https://github.com/pxpana/SSLWildlife.

- **Summary**: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation, which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the representations to regress positional information of the patches from high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

- **Summary**: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution for real-world surveillance applications.

- **Summary**: Echocardiography (echo) plays an indispensable role in the clinical practice of heart diseases. However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation.   To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into a personalized 3D heart model.   We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important breakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of 5.75\% ). This study provides a new way for personalized 3D structure and function analysis from cardiac ultrasound and is of great potential in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

- **Summary**: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

- **Summary**: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity, and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality and consistency throughout animation.

- **Summary**: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation (F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT) framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD) method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA.

- **Summary**: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving. Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time. AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation (BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them suitable for attention mechanisms.

- **Summary**: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images. However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios. Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image, without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR (20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection, non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA) fully-supervised ones.

- **Summary**: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology, watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also significantly improved geometric integrity.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them, pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information, non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution, the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33 videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the foundation models on our dataset.

- **Summary**: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis, enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities. Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored, limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is designed to explicitly attend to the most relevant content. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that MedFormer outperforms existing medical vision transformers in terms of generality and efficiency. Extensive experiments across various imaging modality datasets show that MedFormer consistently enhances performance in all three medical image recognition tasks mentioned above. MedFormer provides an efficient and versatile solution for medical image recognition, with strong potential for clinical application.

- **Summary**: Mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care in patients with stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). However, only 50% of successfully treated patients show a favorable outcome. We developed and evaluated interpretable deep learning models to predict functional outcomes in terms of the modified Rankin Scale score alongside individualized treatment effects (ITEs) using data of 449 LVO stroke patients from a randomized clinical trial. Besides clinical variables, we considered non-contrast CT (NCCT) and angiography (CTA) scans which were integrated using novel foundation models to make use of advanced imaging information. Clinical variables had a good predictive power for binary functional outcome prediction (AUC of 0.719 [0.666, 0.774]) which could slightly be improved when adding CTA imaging (AUC of 0.737 [0.687, 0.795]). Adding NCCT scans or a combination of NCCT and CTA scans to clinical features yielded no improvement. The most important clinical predictor for functional outcome was pre-stroke disability. While estimated ITEs were well calibrated to the average treatment effect, discriminatory ability was limited indicated by a C-for-Benefit statistic of around 0.55 in all models. In summary, the models allowed us to jointly integrate CT imaging and clinical features while achieving state-of-the-art prediction performance and ITE estimates. Yet, further research is needed to particularly improve ITE estimation.

- **Summary**: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages. In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability, leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3) dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on scientific data encoding tasks.

- **Summary**: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence, the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and mAP@50-95 metrics.

- **Summary**: India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases across different crops are critical for improving yield and ensuring food security. This paper proposes a deep learning based solution for detecting multiple diseases in multiple crops, aimed to cover India's diverse agricultural landscape. We first create a unified dataset encompassing images of 17 different crops and 34 different diseases from various available repositories. Proposed deep learning model is trained on this dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops, diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%. Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23 key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units. Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological analysis, enhancing the efficiency of genetic selection and contributing to more sustainable aquaculture practices.The code are available at https://github.com/AbiamRemacheGonzalez/ImaShrimp-public

- **Summary**: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously achieved.

- **Summary**: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The code and data are available at https://www.buzhenhuang.com/works/CloseApp.html.

- **Summary**: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them, meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a framework that joins the three representations under differentiable transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit. Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and brain vessels.

- **Summary**: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology, which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics (semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3 modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in mSSL.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover, it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent embeddings for generated image detection.

- **Summary**: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data, AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

- **Summary**: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and representative datasets containing faulty image data.   This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this private link is available.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the facial attributes.

- **Summary**: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However, existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight, we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing, which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical foundation and practical effectiveness.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

- **Summary**: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to recalibrate semantic features. The key novelties of MEGANet-W include a two-level Haar wavelet head for multi-orientation edge extraction; and Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (W-EGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with boundary and input branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANet-W consistently outperforms existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while introducing no additional learnable parameters. This approach improves reliability in difficult cases and offers a robust solution for medical image segmentation tasks requiring precise boundary detection.

- **Summary**: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models, we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

- **Summary**: Robotic grasping faces challenges in adapting to objects with varying shapes and sizes. In this paper, we introduce MISCGrasp, a volumetric grasping method that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive feature enhancement for self-adaptive grasping. We propose a query-based interaction between high-level and low-level features through the Insight Transformer, while the Empower Transformer selectively attends to the highest-level features, which synergistically strikes a balance between focusing on fine geometric details and overall geometric structures. Furthermore, MISCGrasp utilizes multi-scale contrastive learning to exploit similarities among positive grasp samples, ensuring consistency across multi-scale features. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that MISCGrasp outperforms baseline and variant methods in tabletop decluttering tasks.

- **Summary**: Image-based lighting is a widely used technique to reproduce shading under real-world lighting conditions, especially in real-time rendering applications. A particularly challenging scenario involves materials exhibiting a sparkling or glittering appearance, caused by discrete microfacets scattered across their surface. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based lighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment maps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area light illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques. Crucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be executed on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is partitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the corresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we obtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each region. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically sample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian approximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time approximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material properties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable performance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single directional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our approach requires twice as much memory to store the prefiltered environment map.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm - specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency, while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at inference time.

- **Summary**: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training (APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse images with limited reference data.

- **Summary**: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos. To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically, CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal consistency, and identity preservation.

- **Summary**: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

- **Summary**: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets. First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class scenarios.

- **Summary**: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However, generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training. To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly. Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image generation under different scenarios.

- **Summary**: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative. Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model. Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised approaches.

- **Summary**: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks, from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work, we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in $n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator (MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

- **Summary**: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF) to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional semi-supervised algorithms.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems: movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact, lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs. Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

- **Summary**: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

Existing automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks: highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500 professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.

- **Summary**: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors, as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1) memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP), PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

- **Summary**: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations, complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However, splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'. This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular reflections.

- **Summary**: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information. However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics (segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC), trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining. Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.

- **Summary**: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment. However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed, where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction. Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features, and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised, statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation, thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels. Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs. However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs. Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models, have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content. Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video generation.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs, i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps. To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e., bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables, receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

- **Summary**: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference. Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling, pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora, Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance, reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36% PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video generation in both research and practical applications.

- **Summary**: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas. LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials, and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact, editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark, along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page: https://litereality.github.io; Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecK9m3LXg2c

- **Summary**: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600, UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters, across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

- **Summary**: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is available at: https://github.com/YkiWu/Point3R.

- **Summary**: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the multimodal sim-to-real gap.

- **Summary**: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins. Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy, and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

- **Summary**: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations we observe that the various operators have their own significance while studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

- **Summary**: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency, and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark, we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

- **Summary**: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data, we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual systems.

- **Summary**: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm) critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest, AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics, contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and broader crop applicability.

- **Summary**: Like many countries, Nigeria is naturally endowed with fertile agricultural soil that supports large-scale tomato production. However, the prevalence of disease causing pathogens poses a significant threat to tomato health, often leading to reduced yields and, in severe cases, the extinction of certain species. These diseases jeopardise both the quality and quantity of tomato harvests, contributing to food insecurity. Fortunately, tomato diseases can often be visually identified through distinct forms, appearances, or textures, typically first visible on leaves and fruits. This study presents an enhanced Capsule-YOLO network architecture designed to automatically segment overlapping and occluded tomato leaf images from complex backgrounds using the YOLO framework. It identifies disease symptoms with impressive performance metrics: 99.31% accuracy, 98.78% recall, and 99.09% precision, and a 98.93% F1-score representing improvements of 2.91%, 1.84%, 5.64%, and 4.12% over existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed to allow farmers and users to upload images of affected tomato plants and detect early disease symptoms. The system also provides recommendations for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of this approach promises significant benefits for the agricultural sector by enhancing crop yields and strengthening food security.
