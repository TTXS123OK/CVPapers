- **Summary**: We propose a learnable variational model that learns the features and leverages complementary information from both image and measurement domains for image reconstruction. In particular, we introduce a learned alternating minimization algorithm (LAMA) from our prior work, which tackles two-block nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by incorporating a residual learning architecture in a proximal alternating framework. In this work, our goal is to provide a complete and rigorous convergence proof of LAMA and show that all accumulation points of a specified subsequence of LAMA must be Clarke stationary points of the problem. LAMA directly yields a highly interpretable neural network architecture called LAMA-Net. Notably, in addition to the results shown in our prior work, we demonstrate that the convergence property of LAMA yields outstanding stability and robustness of LAMA-Net in this work. We also show that the performance of LAMA-Net can be further improved by integrating a properly designed network that generates suitable initials, which we call iLAMA-Net. To evaluate LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net, we conduct several experiments and compare them with several state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography.

- **Summary**: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b) self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer. The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods.

- **Summary**: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings. In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks: perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin, and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with 8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and 4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

- **Summary**: This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for automated segmentation of brain regions and classification of amyloid positivity using positron emission tomography (PET) images alone, without the need for structural MRI or CT. A 3D U-Net architecture with four layers of depth was trained and validated on a dataset of 200 F18-florbetapir amyloid-PET scans, with an 130/20/50 train/validation/test split. Segmentation performance was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients across 30 brain regions, with scores ranging from 0.45 to 0.88, demonstrating high anatomical accuracy, particularly in subcortical structures. Quantitative fidelity of PET uptake within clinically relevant regions. Precuneus, prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus, and lateral temporal cortex was assessed using normalized root mean square error, achieving values as low as 0.0011. Furthermore, the model achieved a classification accuracy of 0.98 for amyloid positivity based on regional uptake quantification, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99. These results highlight the model's potential for integration into PET only diagnostic pipelines, particularly in settings where structural imaging is not available. This approach reduces dependence on coregistration and manual delineation, enabling scalable, reliable, and reproducible analysis in clinical and research applications. Future work will focus on clinical validation and extension to diverse PET tracers including C11 PiB and other F18 labeled compounds.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

- **Summary**: Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in multi-temporal satellite imagery is critical for real-world scenarios. However, existing methods typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and (3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal large language models and remote sensing vision-language models.

- **Summary**: Recognizing and differentiating among both familiar and unfamiliar faces is a critical capability for face recognition systems and a key step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Motivated by this ability, this paper introduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face recognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized category discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled known identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen IDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high cardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD approaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method that dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using lightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a HyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned on each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle identity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms existing GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving state-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face recognition.

- **Summary**: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with large video datasets, video dataset distillation aims to capture spatial and temporal information in a significantly smaller dataset, such that training on the distilled data has comparable performance to training on all of the data. We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video distillation method. GVD jointly distills spatial and temporal features, ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC). Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF. Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30 percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video datasets demonstrate that GVD not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without significantly increasing computational cost.

- **Summary**: A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to decode mental states from brain activity. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity -- remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning. Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.

- **Summary**: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end, we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further research. The code and data is available at: https://github.com/katariaak579/GEMS

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection. In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs, underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations, we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to existing frameworks.

- **Summary**: Moir\'e patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive structures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant obstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and industrial defect inspection. With the advancements in deep learning algorithms, numerous studies-predominantly based on convolutional neural networks-have suggested various solutions to address this issue. Despite these efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\'e patterns, primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\'e patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moir\'e patterns. It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block (MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moir\'e structures, and Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together, these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic deployment.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal perception is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations, as it enables a comprehensive understanding of the UAVs' surrounding environment. However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses. These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and novel view synthesis (NVS).

- **Summary**: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries, offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes.

- **Summary**: Computer-generated holography (CGH) represents a transformative visualization approach for next-generation immersive virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) displays, enabling precise wavefront modulation and naturally providing comprehensive physiological depth cues without the need for bulky optical assemblies. Despite significant advancements in computational algorithms enhancing image quality and achieving real-time generation, practical implementations of holographic near-eye displays (NEDs) continue to face substantial challenges arising from finite and dynamically varying pupil apertures, which degrade image quality and compromise user experience. In this study, we introduce an eyepiece-free pupil-optimized holographic NED. Our proposed method employs a customized spherical phase modulation strategy to generate multiple viewpoints within the pupil, entirely eliminating the dependence on conventional optical eyepieces. Through the joint optimization of amplitude and phase distributions across these viewpoints, the method markedly mitigates image degradation due to finite pupil sampling and resolves inapparent depth cues induced by the spherical phase. The demonstrated method signifies a substantial advancement toward the realization of compact, lightweight, and flexible holographic NED systems, fulfilling stringent requirements for future VR/AR display technologies.

- **Summary**: Real-time video analysis remains a challenging problem in computer vision, requiring efficient processing of both spatial and temporal information while maintaining computational efficiency. Existing approaches often struggle to balance accuracy and speed, particularly in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages advanced spatial-temporal modeling techniques for simultaneous action recognition and object tracking. Our approach builds upon recent advances in parallel sequence modeling and introduces a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant spatial regions across temporal sequences. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while maintaining real-time inference speeds. Extensive experiments on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and MOT17 datasets show improvements of 3.2% in action recognition accuracy and 2.8% in tracking precision compared to existing methods, with 40% faster inference time.

- **Summary**: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions, revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss functions, including CE, C\&W, DLR, and MIFPE, in terms of attack potency and robustness evaluation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question: Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data than ours.

- **Summary**: Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation, sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation, we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations. Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain adaptation in real-world motion blur environments.

- **Summary**: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity, demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

- **Summary**: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers. Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology (PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing its scalability for real-world applications. We will release the related codes at https://github.com/IRMVLab/TopoLiDM.

- **Summary**: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs. Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex degradations.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations. While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently, memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM), we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness. Project page: https://github.com/ZhengxyFlow/HMHI-Net .

- **Summary**: Social media platforms increasingly struggle to detect harmful content that promotes muscle dysmorphic behaviors, particularly pro-bigorexia content that disproportionately affects adolescent males. Unlike traditional eating disorder detection focused on the "thin ideal," pro-bigorexia material masquerades as legitimate fitness content through complex multimodal combinations of visual displays, coded language, and motivational messaging that evade text-based detection systems. We address this challenge by developing BigTokDetect, a clinically-informed detection framework for identifying pro-bigorexia content on TikTok. We introduce BigTok, the first expert-annotated multimodal dataset of over 2,200 TikTok videos labeled by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists across five primary categories spanning body image, nutrition, exercise, supplements, and masculinity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art vision language models, we achieve 82.9% accuracy on primary category classification and 69.0% on subcategory detection via domain-specific finetuning. Our ablation studies demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves performance by 5-10% over text-only approaches, with video features providing the most discriminative signals. These findings establish new benchmarks for multimodal harmful content detection and provide both the computational tools and methodological framework needed for scalable content moderation in specialized mental health domains.

- **Summary**: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media, identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

- **Summary**: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465 in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Karl1109/LIDAR-Mamba.

- **Summary**: Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization in zero-shot settings.

- **Summary**: Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems, as even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain degradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs, bitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and understudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and labor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame, resulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery remains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames may mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper, we propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to different types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the framework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich priors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and corruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery. Additionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC) module, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level corruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and high-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our method suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive evaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in bitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask sequence. The demonstrated effectiveness will help to realize improved user experience, wider application scenarios, and more reliable multimedia communication and storage systems.

- **Summary**: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns, driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask, we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions. We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

- **Summary**: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

- **Summary**: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and 46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities. Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile, simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our code is available at: https://github.com/wangzy01/ACTIVE-Action-from-Robotic-View.

- **Summary**: End-to-end (E2E) designed imaging systems integrate coded optical designs with decoding algorithms to enhance imaging fidelity for diverse visual tasks. However, existing E2E designs encounter significant challenges in maintaining high image fidelity at wide fields of view, due to high computational complexity, as well as difficulties in modeling off-axis wave propagation while accounting for off-axis aberrations. In particular, the common approach of placing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a global control of the wavefront. To overcome these limitations, this work explores an additional design choice by positioning a DOE off-aperture, enabling a spatial unmixing of the degrees of freedom and providing local control over the wavefront over the image plane. Our approach further leverages hybrid refractive-diffractive optical systems by linking differentiable ray and wave optics modeling, thereby optimizing depth imaging quality and demonstrating system versatility. Experimental results reveal that the off-aperture DOE enhances the imaging quality by over 5 dB in PSNR at a FoV of approximately $45^\circ$ when paired with a simple thin lens, outperforming traditional on-aperture systems. Furthermore, we successfully recover color and depth information at nearly $28^\circ$ FoV using off-aperture DOE configurations with compound optics. Physical prototypes for both applications validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP) framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a 1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012, ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 69.1%.

- **Summary**: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures. However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently complex task characteristics, few researches have been reported in this domain. To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and 11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The source code and dataset will be publicly available at \{https://github.com/scott-yjyang/HRVVS}.

- **Summary**: Various (text) prompt filters and (image) safety checkers have been implemented to mitigate the misuse of Text-to-Image (T2I) models in creating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. In order to expose potential security vulnerabilities of such safeguards, multimodal jailbreaks have been studied. However, existing jailbreaks are limited to prompt-specific and image-specific perturbations, which suffer from poor scalability and time-consuming optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Universally Unfiltered and Unseen (U3)-Attack, a multimodal jailbreak attack method against T2I safeguards. Specifically, U3-Attack optimizes an adversarial patch on the image background to universally bypass safety checkers and optimizes a safe paraphrase set from a sensitive word to universally bypass prompt filters while eliminating redundant computations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our U3-Attack on both open-source and commercial T2I models. For example, on the commercial Runway-inpainting model with both prompt filter and safety checker, our U3-Attack achieves $~4\times$ higher success rates than the state-of-the-art multimodal jailbreak attack, MMA-Diffusion.

- **Summary**: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods across all scenarios.

- **Summary**: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague. The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map (DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset. The open-source code of this work is released at: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/Low-Cost-Accurate-Radar-Based-Human-Motion-Direction-Determination.

- **Summary**: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier, leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier. We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based OOD detection methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various forms of unseen image degradation.

- **Summary**: Backpropagation-based approaches aim to align diffusion models with reward functions through end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient within the denoising chain, offering a promising perspective. However, due to the computational costs and the risk of gradient explosion associated with the lengthy denoising chain, existing approaches struggle to achieve complete gradient backpropagation, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning strategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model, which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the foundational model. Our method has been rigorously tested and can be effectively applied to various reward functions, significantly improving alignment performance and surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives.

- **Summary**: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD, Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on head samples.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the creation of a new form of digital art: optical illusions--visual tricks that create different perceptions of reality. However, adversaries may misuse such techniques to generate hateful illusions, which embed specific hate messages into harmless scenes and disseminate them across web communities. In this work, we take the first step toward investigating the risks of scalable hateful illusion generation and the potential for bypassing current content moderation models. Specifically, we generate 1,860 optical illusions using Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, conditioned on 62 hate messages. Of these, 1,571 are hateful illusions that successfully embed hate messages, either overtly or subtly, forming the Hateful Illusion dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of six moderation classifiers and nine vision language models (VLMs) in identifying hateful illusions. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities in existing moderation models: the detection accuracy falls below 0.245 for moderation classifiers and below 0.102 for VLMs. We further identify a critical limitation in their vision encoders, which mainly focus on surface-level image details while overlooking the secondary layer of information, i.e., hidden messages. To address this risk, we explore preliminary mitigation measures and identify the most effective approaches from the perspectives of image transformations and training-level strategies.

- **Summary**: Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation, particularly when dealing with missing modalities, remains a critical challenge in medical image analysis. Previous studies have not fully resolved the challenges of tumor boundary segmentation insensitivity and feature transfer in the absence of key imaging modalities. In this study, we introduce MST-KDNet, aimed at addressing these critical issues. Our model features Multi-Scale Transformer Knowledge Distillation to effectively capture attention weights at various resolutions, Dual-Mode Logit Distillation to improve the transfer of knowledge, and a Global Style Matching Module that integrates feature matching with adversarial learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the BraTS and FeTS 2024 datasets demonstrate that MST-KDNet surpasses current leading methods in both Dice and HD95 scores, particularly in conditions with substantial modality loss. Our approach shows exceptional robustness and generalization potential, making it a promising candidate for real-world clinical applications.

- **Summary**: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material, texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a global description with paired localized sketch + text information for conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its unprecedented level of design customization.

- **Summary**: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections, refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a 3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases: self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of drones in civilian airspace has raised urgent security concerns, necessitating robust real-time surveillance systems. In response to the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams, deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality, addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR channels.

- **Summary**: 3D point cloud segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to individual points in a scene for fine-grained spatial understanding. Existing methods typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation. Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various models.

- **Summary**: Recently, large foundation models trained on vast datasets have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in feature extraction and general feature representation. The ongoing advancements in deep learning-driven large models have shown great promise in accelerating unsupervised change detection methods, thereby enhancing the practical applicability of change detection technologies. Building on this progress, this paper introduces MergeSAM, an innovative unsupervised change detection method for high-resolution remote sensing imagery, based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Two novel strategies, MaskMatching and MaskSplitting, are designed to address real-world complexities such as object splitting, merging, and other intricate changes. The proposed method fully leverages SAM's object segmentation capabilities to construct multitemporal masks that capture complex changes, embedding the spatial structure of land cover into the change detection process.

- **Summary**: Leaf wetness detection is a crucial task in agricultural monitoring, as it directly impacts the prediction and protection of plant diseases. However, existing sensing systems suffer from limitations in robustness, accuracy, and environmental resilience when applied to natural leaves under dynamic real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we introduce a new multi-modal dataset specifically designed for evaluating and advancing machine learning algorithms in leaf wetness detection. Our dataset comprises synchronized mmWave raw data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, and RGB images collected over six months from five diverse plant species in both controlled and outdoor field environments. We provide detailed benchmarks using the Hydra model, including comparisons against single modality baselines and multiple fusion strategies, as well as performance under varying scan distances. Additionally, our dataset can serve as a benchmark for future SAR imaging algorithm optimization, enabling a systematic evaluation of detection accuracy under diverse conditions.

- **Summary**: Scoliosis is a prevalent condition that impacts both physical health and appearance, with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) being the most common form. Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant limitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and remote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB images to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible to environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model stability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel pipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back, compensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine morphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the subtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an adaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale Adaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both patch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based Hybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF) module is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our depth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different evaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%, respectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we integrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation. This integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation, achieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.

- **Summary**: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is pivotal for deploying safe vision systems in open-world environments. We revisit diffusion models, not as generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others, highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation models in anomaly detection.

- **Summary**: Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the 3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template. Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at a $400\times$ faster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT. Moreover, when it comes to generating finer details and severe occlusions, our method outperforms the existing methodologies by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Memes are popular in the modern world and are distributed primarily for entertainment. However, harmful ideologies such as misogyny can be propagated through innocent-looking memes. The detection and understanding of why a meme is misogynous is a research challenge due to its multimodal nature (image and text) and its nuanced manifestations across different societal contexts. We introduce a novel multimodal approach, \textit{namely}, \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic content in memes. \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image modalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a cross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily processed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and Large Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed on a newly curated dataset (\textit{\textbf{W}hat's \textbf{B}eneath \textbf{M}isogynous \textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting misogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories, \textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only detects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of how misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing methods. The code and dataset are available at \href{https://github.com/kushalkanwarNS/WhatisBeneathMisogyny/tree/main}{https://github.com/Misogyny}.

- **Summary**: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently, event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at https://github.com/suhang99/AsyncTrack-Motion-Solver.

- **Summary**: Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.

- **Summary**: Advances in Generative AI have made video-level deepfake detection increasingly challenging, exposing the limitations of current detection techniques. In this paper, we present HOLA, our solution to the Video-Level Deepfake Detection track of 2025 1M-Deepfakes Detection Challenge. Inspired by the success of large-scale pre-training in the general domain, we first scale audio-visual self-supervised pre-training in the multimodal video-level deepfake detection, which leverages our self-built dataset of 1.81M samples, thereby leading to a unified two-stage framework. To be specific, HOLA features an iterative-aware cross-modal learning module for selective audio-visual interactions, hierarchical contextual modeling with gated aggregations under the local-global perspective, and a pyramid-like refiner for scale-aware cross-grained semantic enhancements. Moreover, we propose the pseudo supervised singal injection strategy to further boost model performance. Extensive experiments across expert models and MLLMs impressivly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HOLA. We also conduct a series of ablation studies to explore the crucial design factors of our introduced components. Remarkably, our HOLA ranks 1st, outperforming the second by 0.0476 AUC on the TestA set.

- **Summary**: Feature matching is a cornerstone task in computer vision, essential for applications such as image retrieval, stereo matching, 3D reconstruction, and SLAM. This survey comprehensively reviews modality-based feature matching, exploring traditional handcrafted methods and emphasizing contemporary deep learning approaches across various modalities, including RGB images, depth images, 3D point clouds, LiDAR scans, medical images, and vision-language interactions. Traditional methods, leveraging detectors like Harris corners and descriptors such as SIFT and ORB, demonstrate robustness under moderate intra-modality variations but struggle with significant modality gaps. Contemporary deep learning-based methods, exemplified by detector-free strategies like CNN-based SuperPoint and transformer-based LoFTR, substantially improve robustness and adaptability across modalities. We highlight modality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors for depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds, attention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions like the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching. Cross-modal applications, particularly in medical image registration and vision-language tasks, underscore the evolution of feature matching to handle increasingly diverse data interactions.

- **Summary**: Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) presents a complex yet critical challenge in computer vision, requiring robust integration of segmentation and tracking across temporally dynamic frames. Traditional methods have struggled with domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency. The emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its successor, SAM2, has introduced a paradigm shift, enabling prompt-driven segmentation with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon these advances, this survey provides a comprehensive review of SAM/SAM2-based methods for VOST, structured along three temporal dimensions: past, present, and future. We examine strategies for retaining and updating historical information (past), approaches for extracting and optimizing discriminative features from the current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation mechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In doing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to the streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2. We also discuss recent innovations such as motion-aware memory selection and trajectory-guided prompting, which aim to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we identify remaining challenges including memory redundancy, error accumulation, and prompt inefficiency, and suggest promising directions for future research. This survey offers a timely and structured overview of the field, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of VOST through the lens of foundation models.

- **Summary**: Automated polyp segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, yet developing robust models remains challenging due to limited annotated data and significant performance degradation under domain shift. Although semi-supervised learning (SSL) reduces annotation requirements, existing methods rely on generic augmentations that ignore polyp-specific structural properties, resulting in poor generalization to new imaging centers and devices. To address this, we introduce Frequency Prior Guided Matching (FPGM), a novel augmentation framework built on a key discovery: polyp edges exhibit a remarkably consistent frequency signature across diverse datasets. FPGM leverages this intrinsic regularity in a two-stage process. It first learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from the edge regions of labeled polyps. Then, it performs principled spectral perturbations on unlabeled images, aligning their amplitude spectra with this learned prior while preserving phase information to maintain structural integrity. This targeted alignment normalizes domain-specific textural variations, thereby compelling the model to learn the underlying, generalizable anatomical structure. Validated on six public datasets, FPGM establishes a new state-of-the-art against ten competing methods. It demonstrates exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities, achieving over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in data-scarce scenarios. By significantly enhancing cross-domain robustness, FPGM presents a powerful solution for clinically deployable polyp segmentation under limited supervision.

- **Summary**: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers, posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of 0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing prenatal care in resource-limited settings.

- **Summary**: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo (Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious "shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training. Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier; through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to 7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong prior assumptions about triggers.

- **Summary**: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years, geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution, as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic parameter estimation in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: AI-generated face detectors trained via supervised learning typically rely on synthesized images from specific generators, limiting their generalization to emerging generative techniques. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces. In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen generators.

- **Summary**: We propose DepR, a depth-guided single-view scene reconstruction framework that integrates instance-level diffusion within a compositional paradigm. Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout. Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference. Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding, planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy, structural coherence, and code correctness.

- **Summary**: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry, semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate features without image reconstruction.   We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage, we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer. Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without additional training costs.

- **Summary**: In ReLU networks, gradients of output units can be seen as their input-level representations, as they correspond to the units' pullbacks through the active subnetwork. However, gradients of deeper models are notoriously misaligned, significantly contributing to their black-box nature. We claim that this is because active subnetworks are inherently noisy due to the ReLU hard-gating. To tackle that noise, we propose soft-gating in the backward pass only. The resulting input-level vector field (called ''excitation pullback'') exhibits remarkable perceptual alignment, revealing high-resolution input- and target-specific features that ''just make sense'', therefore establishing a compelling novel explanation method. Furthermore, we speculate that excitation pullbacks approximate (directionally) the gradients of a simpler model, linear in the network's path space, learned implicitly during optimization and largely determining the network's decision; thus arguing for the faithfulness of the produced explanations and their overall significance.

- **Summary**: Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide the train and test datasets for the community.

- **Summary**: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%, respectively.

- **Summary**: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality, demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained devices.

- **Summary**: Referring audio-visual segmentation (RAVS) has recently seen significant advancements, yet challenges remain in integrating multimodal information and deeply understanding and reasoning about audiovisual content. To extend the boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset containing 2,104 videos and 61,095 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore, we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of audiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and perform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on other related tasks.

- **Summary**: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization, cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C, while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable, fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban environments.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models for skin disease classification require large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. However, such resources are often limited due to privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs) offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case subgroup performance. Code and data are available here.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification. Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.

- **Summary**: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing, to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous approaches in both efficiency and quality.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence) models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.   Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings. Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.   These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces, primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

- **Summary**: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems, and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation, allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

- **Summary**: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR) techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs. Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet, which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process. Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running power by 61.55\%.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

- **Summary**: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation, maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

- **Summary**: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.   On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate.   Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species, car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem. Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method, Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable and generalizable systems for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them. Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly, surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast. State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis, we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii) cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63% Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at https://pancreasdg.netlify.app.

- **Summary**: We introduce MRpro, an open-source image reconstruction package built upon PyTorch and open data formats. The framework comprises three main areas. First, it provides unified data structures for the consistent manipulation of MR datasets and their associated metadata (e.g., k-space trajectories). Second, it offers a library of composable operators, proximable functionals, and optimization algorithms, including a unified Fourier operator for all common trajectories and an extended phase graph simulation for quantitative MR. These components are used to create ready-to-use implementations of key reconstruction algorithms. Third, for deep learning, MRpro includes essential building blocks such as data consistency layers, differentiable optimization layers, and state-of-the-art backbone networks and integrates public datasets to facilitate reproducibility. MRpro is developed as a collaborative project supported by automated quality control. We demonstrate the versatility of MRpro across multiple applications, including Cartesian, radial, and spiral acquisitions; motion-corrected reconstruction; cardiac MR fingerprinting; learned spatially adaptive regularization weights; model-based learned image reconstruction and quantitative parameter estimation. MRpro offers an extensible framework for MR image reconstruction. With reproducibility and maintainability at its core, it facilitates collaborative development and provides a foundation for future MR imaging research.

- **Summary**: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary method.

- **Summary**: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail, learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models are available for research.

- **Summary**: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and upscale Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key considerations for future advancements in the field.

- **Summary**: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions. One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism. Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial resolution.

- **Summary**: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.
