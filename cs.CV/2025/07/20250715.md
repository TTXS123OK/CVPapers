- **Summary**: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a dominant strategy for self-supervised representation learning in natural images, where models are pre-trained to reconstruct masked patches with a pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) between original and reconstructed RGB values as the loss. We observe that MSE encourages blurred image re-construction, but still works for natural images as it preserves dominant edges. However, in medical imaging, when the texture cues are more important for classification of a visual abnormality, the strategy fails. Taking inspiration from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) feature in Radiomics studies, we propose a novel MAE based pre-training framework, GLCM-MAE, using reconstruction loss based on matching GLCM. GLCM captures intensity and spatial relationships in an image, hence proposed loss helps preserve morphological features. Further, we propose a novel formulation to convert matching GLCM matrices into a differentiable loss function. We demonstrate that unsupervised pre-training on medical images with the proposed GLCM loss improves representations for downstream tasks. GLCM-MAE outperforms the current state-of-the-art across four tasks - gallbladder cancer detection from ultrasound images by 2.1%, breast cancer detection from ultrasound by 3.1%, pneumonia detection from x-rays by 0.5%, and COVID detection from CT by 0.6%.

- **Summary**: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial. Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM, MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure accuracy. We also publicly release our code at \href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.

- **Summary**: Tubular tree structures, such as blood vessels and airways, are essential in human anatomy and accurately tracking them while preserving their topology is crucial for various downstream tasks. Trexplorer is a recurrent model designed for centerline tracking in 3D medical images but it struggles with predicting duplicate branches and terminating tracking prematurely. To address these issues, we present Trexplorer Super, an enhanced version that notably improves performance through novel advancements. However, evaluating centerline tracking models is challenging due to the lack of public datasets. To enable thorough evaluation, we develop three centerline datasets, one synthetic and two real, each with increasing difficulty. Using these datasets, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and compare them with our approach. Trexplorer Super outperforms previous SOTA models on every dataset. Our results also highlight that strong performance on synthetic data does not necessarily translate to real datasets. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/RomStriker/Trexplorer-Super.

StructInbet introduces two key contributions. First, we propose explicit structural guidance to the inbetweening problem to reduce the ambiguity inherent in pixel trajectories. Second, we adopt a temporal attention mechanism that incorporates visual identity from both the preceding and succeeding keyframes, ensuring consistency in character appearance.

- **Summary**: Recently, AI-based weather forecast models have achieved impressive advances. These models have reached accuracy levels comparable to traditional NWP systems, marking a significant milestone in data-driven weather prediction. However, they mostly leverage Transformer-based architectures, which often leads to high training complexity and resource demands due to the massive parameter sizes. In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data. Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting, while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate KAI-a's robust skill in capturing extreme events, reinforcing its practical utility.

- **Summary**: Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency. Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.

- **Summary**: Estimating a person's age from their gait has important applications in healthcare, security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we review fifty-nine studies involving over seventy-five thousand subjects recorded with video, wearable and radar sensors. We observe that convolutional neural networks produce an average error of about 4.2 years, inertial-sensor models about 4.5 years and multi-sensor fusion as low as 3.4 years, with notable differences between lab and real-world data. We then analyse sixty-three thousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population dataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride length, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle entropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a ResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the knee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes. Finally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database, we compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks achieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1 seconds. By combining a broad meta-analysis with new large-scale experiments and interpretable visualizations, we establish solid performance baselines and practical guidelines for reducing gait-age error below three years in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's 3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with satellite images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like autonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on fully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations. In this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self distillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View (FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view localization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image, while the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart created by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those of the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores textureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions and reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas or limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly improves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we introduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative orientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view localization challenges. Code and model can be found at https://github.com/tongshw/GeoDistill.

- **Summary**: Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the binary change detection task to provide not only the change locations but also the detailed "from-to" categories in multi-temporal remote sensing data. Such detailed semantic insights into changes offer considerable advantages for a wide array of applications. However, since SCD involves the simultaneous optimization of multiple tasks, the model is prone to negative transfer due to task-specific learning difficulties and conflicting gradient flows. To address this issue, we propose Graph Aggregation Prototype Learning for Semantic Change Detection in remote sensing(GAPL-SCD). In this framework, a multi-task joint optimization method is designed to optimize the primary task of semantic segmentation and change detection, along with the auxiliary task of graph aggregation prototype learning. Adaptive weight allocation and gradient rotation methods are used to alleviate the conflict between training tasks and improve multi-task learning capabilities. Specifically, the graph aggregation prototype learning module constructs an interaction graph using high-level features. Prototypes serve as class proxies, enabling category-level domain alignment across time points and reducing interference from irrelevant changes. Additionally, the proposed self-query multi-level feature interaction and bi-temporal feature fusion modules further enhance multi-scale feature representation, improving performance in complex scenes. Experimental results on the SECOND and Landsat-SCD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in accuracy and robustness for SCD task.

- **Summary**: The latest developments in Face Restoration have yielded significant advancements in visual quality through the utilization of diverse diffusion priors. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of face identity introduced by identity-obscure inputs and stochastic generative processes remains unresolved. To address this challenge, we present Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration (RIDFR), a novel ID-specific face restoration framework based on diffusion models. Specifically, RIDFR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model in conjunction with two parallel conditioning modules. The Content Injection Module inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module integrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR incorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from multiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the interference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up, hair style). Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, reconstructing high-quality ID-specific results with high identity fidelity and demonstrating strong robustness.

- **Summary**: Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on single-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or recipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at malls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both when and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making process of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering the characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that enforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another that guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the robot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures real-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond decisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches. Our findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social robots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party interactions.

- **Summary**: Sports action classification representing complex body postures and player-object interactions is an emerging area in image-based sports analysis. Some works have contributed to automated sports action recognition using machine learning techniques over the past decades. However, sufficient image datasets representing women sports actions with enough intra- and inter-class variations are not available to the researchers. To overcome this limitation, this work presents a new dataset named WomenSports for women sports classification using small-scale training data. This dataset includes a variety of sports activities, covering wide variations in movements, environments, and interactions among players. In addition, this study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for deep feature extraction. A channel attention scheme upon local contextual regions is applied to refine and enhance feature representation. The experiments are carried out on three different sports datasets and one dance dataset for generalizing the proposed algorithm, and the performances on these datasets are noteworthy. The deep learning method achieves 89.15% top-1 classification accuracy using ResNet-50 on the proposed WomenSports dataset, which is publicly available for research at Mendeley Data.

- **Summary**: Large language models, with their strong reasoning ability and rich knowledge, have brought revolution to many tasks of AI, but their impact on sign language generation remains limited due to its complexity and unique rules. In this paper, we propose TEAch Me Sign (TEAM-Sign), treating sign language as another natural language. By fine-tuning an LLM, we enable it to learn the correspondence between text and sign language, and facilitate generation. Considering the differences between sign and spoken language, we employ a stepwise prompting strategy to extract the inherent sign language knowledge within the LLM, thereby supporting the learning and generation process. Experimental results on How2Sign and Phoenix14T datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages both the sign language knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLM to align the different distribution and grammatical rules between sign and spoken language.

- **Summary**: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is essential for accurately localizing and characterizing interactions between humans and objects, providing a comprehensive understanding of complex visual scenes across various domains. However, existing HOI detectors often struggle to deliver reliable predictions efficiently, relying on resource-intensive training methods and inefficient architectures. To address these challenges, we conceptualize a wavelet attention-like backbone and a novel ray-based encoder architecture tailored for HOI detection. Our wavelet backbone addresses the limitations of expressing middle-order interactions by aggregating discriminative features from the low- and high-order interactions extracted from diverse convolutional filters. Concurrently, the ray-based encoder facilitates multi-scale attention by optimizing the focus of the decoder on relevant regions of interest and mitigating computational overhead. As a result of harnessing the attenuated intensity of learnable ray origins, our decoder aligns query embeddings with emphasized regions of interest for accurate predictions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and HICO-DET, showcase the potential of our proposed architecture. The code is publicly available at [https://github.com/henry-pay/RayEncoder].

- **Summary**: Gait is becoming popular as a method of person re-identification because of its ability to identify people at a distance. However, most current works in gait recognition do not address the practical problem of occlusions. Among those which do, some require paired tuples of occluded and holistic sequences, which are impractical to collect in the real world. Further, these approaches work on occlusions but fail to retain performance on holistic inputs. To address these challenges, we propose RG-Gait, a method for residual correction for occluded gait recognition with holistic retention. We model the problem as a residual learning task, conceptualizing the occluded gait signature as a residual deviation from the holistic gait representation. Our proposed network adaptively integrates the learned residual, significantly improving performance on occluded gait sequences without compromising the holistic recognition accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Gait3D, GREW and BRIAR datasets and show that learning the residual can be an effective technique to tackle occluded gait recognition with holistic retention. We release our code publicly at https://github.com/Ayush-00/rg-gait.

- **Summary**: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife, placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore, closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects. In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model, initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats. This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally, various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

- **Summary**: The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular, on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M parameters. The code is publicly available at [https://github.com/henry-pay/SpaRTAN].

- **Summary**: Service robots are increasingly deployed in diverse and dynamic environments, where both physical layouts and social contexts change over time and across locations. In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that rely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting in degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent approaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional planners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor generalization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective sim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an interpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal large language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to adaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene understanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting strategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the mapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters, enabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate hyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and scenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair platform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on quantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort, while receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social acceptance.

- **Summary**: With the advent of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in zero- and few-shot settings, CLIP has been widely applied to zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) in recent research, where the rare classes are essential and expected in many applications. This study introduces \textbf{FiSeCLIP} for ZSAD with training-free \textbf{CLIP}, combining the feature matching with the cross-modal alignment. Testing with the entire dataset is impractical, while batch-based testing better aligns with real industrial needs, and images within a batch can serve as mutual reference points. Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes other images in the same batch as reference information for the current image. However, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we apply text information to \textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we further explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local \textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection tasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits superior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on anomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction, e.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by +4.6\%$\uparrow$/+5.7\%$\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in automated radiology report generation from chest X-rays using deep learning algorithms have the potential to significantly reduce the arduous workload of radiologists. However, due to the inherent massive data bias in radiology images, where abnormalities are typically subtle and sparsely distributed, existing methods often produce fluent yet medically inaccurate reports, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. To address this issue effectively, we propose a Semantically Informed Salient Regions-guided (SISRNet) report generation method. Specifically, our approach explicitly identifies salient regions with medically critical characteristics using fine-grained cross-modal semantics. Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on these high-information regions during both image modeling and report generation, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the negative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate reports. Compared to its peers, SISRNet demonstrates superior performance on widely used IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

- **Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error, under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited generalization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach introduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages precomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian submatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of Llama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from 51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%. Furthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as GPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging W4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision baselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

- **Summary**: We present a novel framework for CBCT-to-MDCT translation, grounded in the Schrodinger Bridge (SB) formulation, which integrates GAN-derived priors with human-guided conditional diffusion. Unlike conventional GANs or diffusion models, our approach explicitly enforces boundary consistency between CBCT inputs and pseudo targets, ensuring both anatomical fidelity and perceptual controllability. Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free guidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically preferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based preference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying on a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed method selectively attenuates shade artifacts in key anatomical regions while preserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate superior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical datasets -- outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods -- while requiring only 10 sampling steps. These findings underscore the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned medical image translation.

- **Summary**: While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed \textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task, including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and real-time efficiency.

- **Summary**: The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for advancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate surface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is inherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations. Thus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of high-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait. Different from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or lower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of the ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address this, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46 subjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a complete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth) along with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views. This structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud completion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset is designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of state-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and multi-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the challenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D has significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment foot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis, prosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of the foot during motion. The dataset is now available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ljw285/FootGait3D.

- **Summary**: Medical language-guided segmentation, integrating textual clinical reports as auxiliary guidance to enhance image segmentation, has demonstrated significant improvements over unimodal approaches. However, its inherent reliance on paired image-text input, which we refer to as ``textual reliance", presents two fundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired reports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for training; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with paired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where segmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we propose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for language-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At its core, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic Approximation (PSA) module to enable approximation of semantic guidance from textual input. PSA initializes a discrete and compact prototype space by distilling segmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once initialized, it supports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates semantic guidance for images without textual input, thereby alleviating textual reliance. Extensive experiments on QaTa-COV19, MosMedData+ and Kvasir-SEG demonstrate that ProLearn outperforms state-of-the-art language-guided methods when limited text is available.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in 3D neural representations and instance-level editing models have enabled the efficient creation of high-quality 3D content. However, achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction (3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits. Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local 3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

- **Summary**: Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions, ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting. Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning. TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore, despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images. Code and more results are available at https://jeongyun0609.github.io/TRAN-D/.

- **Summary**: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision, automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends, thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing field.

- **Summary**: Log anomaly detection using traditional rule based or deep learning based methods is often challenging due to the large volume and highly complex nature of log sequence. So effective way of detection of anomalous sequence of logs is crucial for system maintenance and development. This paper proposes parameter efficient finetuning specifically low rank adaptation (LoRA) and adapter based approaches for finding contextual anomalies in sequence of logs in large log data set. It compares different tiny large language models (LLMs) on the Thunderbird dataset. The results show that LoRA based finetuning provides substantial performance improvements of 18 to 19 percentage over LogBert based full finetuning approach, achieving accuracy scores between 97.76% and 98.83% compared to 79.37%.

- **Summary**: Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet. Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.

- **Summary**: Monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft is significant for on-orbit service (OOS) tasks, such as satellite maintenance, space debris removal, and station assembly. Considering the high demands on pose estimation accuracy, mainstream monocular pose estimation methods typically consist of keypoint detectors and PnP solver. However, current keypoint detectors remain vulnerable to structural symmetry and partial occlusion of non-cooperative spacecraft. To this end, we propose a graph-based keypoints network for the monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft, GKNet, which leverages the geometric constraint of keypoints graph. In order to better validate keypoint detectors, we present a moderate-scale dataset for the spacecraft keypoint detection, named SKD, which consists of 3 spacecraft targets, 90,000 simulated images, and corresponding high-precise keypoint annotations. Extensive experiments and an ablation study have demonstrated the high accuracy and effectiveness of our GKNet, compared to the state-of-the-art spacecraft keypoint detectors. The code for GKNet and the SKD dataset is available at https://github.com/Dongzhou-1996/GKNet.

- **Summary**: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become a rapid and non-destructive solution for road subsurface distress (RSD) detection. However, RSD recognition from GPR images is labor-intensive and heavily relies on inspectors' expertise. Deep learning offers the possibility for automatic RSD recognition, but its current performance is limited by two factors: Scarcity of high-quality dataset for network training and insufficient capability of network to distinguish RSD. In this study, a rigorously validated 3D GPR dataset containing 2134 samples of diverse types was constructed through field scanning. Based on the finding that the YOLO model trained with one of the three scans of GPR images exhibits varying sensitivity to specific type of RSD, we proposed a novel cross-verification strategy with outstanding accuracy in RSD recognition, achieving recall over 98.6% in field tests. The approach, integrated into an online RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.

- **Summary**: Atmospheric structure, represented by backscatter coefficients (BC) recovered from satellite LiDAR attenuated backscatter (ATB), provides a volumetric view of clouds, aerosols, and molecules, playing a critical role in human activities, climate understanding, and extreme weather forecasting. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary inputs and simplified physics-based approximations, and lack a standardized 3D benchmark for fair evaluation. However, such approaches may introduce additional uncertainties and insufficiently capture realistic radiative transfer and atmospheric scattering-absorption effects. To bridge these gaps, we present Atmos-Bench: the first 3D atmospheric benchmark, along with a novel FourCastX: Frequency-enhanced Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts Network that (a) generates 921,600 image slices from 3D scattering volumes simulated at 532 nm and 355 nm by coupling WRF with an enhanced COSP simulator over 384 land-ocean time steps, yielding high-quality voxel-wise references; (b) embeds ATB-BC physical constraints into the model architecture, promoting energy consistency during restoration; (c) achieves consistent improvements on the Atmos-Bench dataset across both 355 nm and 532 nm bands, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline models without relying on auxiliary inputs. Atmos-Bench establishes a new standard for satellite-based 3D atmospheric structure recovery and paves the way for deeper climate insight.

- **Summary**: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation, facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches. Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL) from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.

- **Summary**: In recent years, visual recognition methods have advanced significantly, finding applications across diverse fields. While researchers seek to understand the mechanisms behind the success of these models, there is also a growing impetus to deploy them in critical areas like autonomous driving and medical diagnostics to better diagnose failures, which promotes the development of interpretability research. This paper systematically reviews existing research on the interpretability of visual recognition models and proposes a taxonomy of methods from a human-centered perspective. The proposed taxonomy categorizes interpretable recognition methods based on Intent, Object, Presentation, and Methodology, thereby establishing a systematic and coherent set of grouping criteria for these XAI methods. Additionally, we summarize the requirements for evaluation metrics and explore new opportunities enabled by recent technologies, such as large multimodal models. We aim to organize existing research in this domain and inspire future investigations into the interpretability of visual recognition models.

- **Summary**: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized image understanding by bridging textual and visual modalities. However, these models often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as the precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects, particularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as fine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In this paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that specifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the integration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By unifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself as an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The model is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first interprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise positions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push the boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over 500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles, and scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++ to unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization. Comprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified solution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative implications for human-AI interaction.

- **Summary**: Jellyfish, a diverse group of gelatinous marine organisms, play a crucial role in maintaining marine ecosystems but pose significant challenges for biodiversity and conservation due to their rapid proliferation and ecological impact. Accurate identification of jellyfish species is essential for ecological monitoring and management. In this study, we proposed a deep learning framework for jellyfish species detection and classification using an underwater image dataset. The framework integrates advanced feature extraction techniques, including MobileNetV3, ResNet50, EfficientNetV2-B0, and VGG16, combined with seven traditional machine learning classifiers and three Feedforward Neural Network classifiers for precise species identification. Additionally, we activated the softmax function to directly classify jellyfish species using the convolutional neural network models. The combination of the Artificial Neural Network with MobileNetV3 is our best-performing model, achieving an exceptional accuracy of 98%, significantly outperforming other feature extractor-classifier combinations. This study demonstrates the efficacy of deep learning and hybrid frameworks in addressing biodiversity challenges and advancing species detection in marine environments.

- **Summary**: Hard samples pose a significant challenge in person re-identification (ReID) tasks, particularly in clothing-changing person Re-ID (CC-ReID). Their inherent ambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes them a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of targeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under clothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which is the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly define, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL comprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation (DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent samples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives for effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2) Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware optimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic labels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives closer in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability and robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the potential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust CC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the targeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PRCC and LTCC datasets.

- **Summary**: Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts, arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality. Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to additional modalities.

- **Summary**: In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the extreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of human activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural resources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the extremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or highland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model which explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide events. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain free resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote sensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for two tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our proposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie, and Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23, 93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU scores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense, Nepal datasets. These experimental results prove potential to integrate our proposed model into real-life landslide observation systems.

- **Summary**: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical settings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D spatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant time consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based on sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from researchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent years, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have demonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction. Nonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent representation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT modalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment within the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature contrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray images and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental results indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art generative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing the effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but can also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as text-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research and applications in other domains.

- **Summary**: With the widespread adoption of large vision-language models, the capacity for color vision in these models is crucial. However, the color vision abilities of large visual-language models have not yet been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we define a color vision testing task for large vision-language models and construct a dataset \footnote{Anonymous Github Showing some of the data https://anonymous.4open.science/r/color-vision-test-dataset-3BCD} that covers multiple categories of test questions and tasks of varying difficulty levels. Furthermore, we analyze the types of errors made by large vision-language models and propose fine-tuning strategies to enhance their performance in color vision tests.

- **Summary**: Citrus, as one of the most economically important fruit crops globally, suffers severe yield depressions due to various diseases. Accurate disease detection and classification serve as critical prerequisites for implementing targeted control measures. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning-based computer vision algorithms, have substantially decreased time and labor requirements while maintaining the accuracy of detection and classification. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly rely on massive, high-quality annotated training examples to attain promising performance. By introducing two key designs: contrasting with cluster centroids and a multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) paradigm, this paper proposes a novel clustering-guided self-supervised multi-layer contrastive representation learning (CMCRL) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates several advantages over existing counterparts: (1) optimizing with massive unannotated samples; (2) effective adaptation to the symptom similarity across distinct citrus diseases; (3) hierarchical feature representation learning. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public citrus image set CDD, outperforming existing methods by 4.5\%-30.1\% accuracy. Remarkably, our method narrows the performance gap with fully supervised counterparts (all samples are labeled). Beyond classification accuracy, our method shows great performance on other evaluation metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall), highlighting the robustness against the class imbalance challenge.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale corpora excel at natural image tasks and are increasingly repurposed for healthcare; however, their competence in medical tasks remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs, ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert, OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third, performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation protocols.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

- **Summary**: Within a legal framework, fairness in datasets and models is typically assessed by dividing observations into predefined groups and then computing fairness measures (e.g., Disparate Impact or Equality of Odds with respect to gender). However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous, dividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination experienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we propose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly multidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed levels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a novel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby isolating the most critical subgroups.   We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and demonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing how discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes. Furthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the case of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging the skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that the proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than previously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for a given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose, aiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The results demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal impact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door for industrial deployment.

- **Summary**: Smoke is the first visible indicator of a wildfire.With the advancement of deep learning, image-based smoke detection has become a crucial method for detecting and preventing forest fires. However, the scarcity of smoke image data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations, particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic dataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection models.

- **Summary**: 3D visual grounding aims to identify and localize objects in a 3D space based on textual descriptions. However, existing methods struggle with disentangling targets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving inconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To tackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D visual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor queries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a structured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional relationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates textual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal Consistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a Textual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a unified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding datasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

- **Summary**: Automatic Target Detection (ATD) and Recognition (ATR) from Thermal Infrared (TI) imagery in the defense and surveillance domain is a challenging computer vision (CV) task in comparison to the commercial autonomous vehicle perception domain. Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific challenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater distances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution and resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather, temperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios all result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class similarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly, contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform in the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector, called YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the detection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR dataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing protocols. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art ATR performance of up to 99.6%.

- **Summary**: Observer bias and inconsistencies in traditional plant phenotyping methods limit the accuracy and reproducibility of fine-grained plant analysis. To overcome these challenges, we developed TomatoMAP, a comprehensive dataset for Solanum lycopersicum using an Internet of Things (IoT) based imaging system with standardized data acquisition protocols. Our dataset contains 64,464 RGB images that capture 12 different plant poses from four camera elevation angles. Each image includes manually annotated bounding boxes for seven regions of interest (ROIs), including leaves, panicle, batch of flowers, batch of fruits, axillary shoot, shoot and whole plant area, along with 50 fine-grained growth stage classifications based on the BBCH scale. Additionally, we provide 3,616 high-resolution image subset with pixel-wise semantic and instance segmentation annotations for fine-grained phenotyping. We validated our dataset using a cascading model deep learning framework combining MobileNetv3 for classification, YOLOv11 for object detection, and MaskRCNN for segmentation. Through AI vs. Human analysis involving five domain experts, we demonstrate that the models trained on our dataset achieve accuracy and speed comparable to the experts. Cohen's Kappa and inter-rater agreement heatmap confirm the reliability of automated fine-grained phenotyping using our approach.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study task-oriented human grasp synthesis, a new grasp synthesis task that demands both task and context awareness. At the core of our method is the task-aware contact maps. Unlike traditional contact maps that only reason about the manipulated object and its relation with the hand, our enhanced maps take into account scene and task information. This comprehensive map is critical for hand-object interaction, enabling accurate grasping poses that align with the task. We propose a two-stage pipeline that first constructs a task-aware contact map informed by the scene and task. In the subsequent stage, we use this contact map to synthesize task-oriented human grasps. We introduce a new dataset and a metric for the proposed task to evaluate our approach. Our experiments validate the importance of modeling both scene and task, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both grasp quality and task performance.

- **Summary**: In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR), which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the 3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning (DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages: i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$ is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.

- **Summary**: Fluvial erosion is a natural process that can generate significant impacts on soil stability and strategic infrastructures. The detection and monitoring of this phenomenon is traditionally addressed by photogrammetric methods and analysis in geographic information systems. These tasks require specific knowledge and intensive manual processing. This study proposes an artificial intelligence-based approach for automatic identification of eroded zones and estimation of their area. The state-of-the-art computer vision model YOLOv11, adjusted by fine-tuning and trained with photographs and LiDAR images, is used. This combined dataset was segmented and labeled using the Roboflow platform. Experimental results indicate efficient detection of erosion patterns with an accuracy of 70%, precise identification of eroded areas and reliable calculation of their extent in pixels and square meters. As a final product, the EROSCAN system has been developed, an interactive web application that allows users to upload images and obtain automatic segmentations of fluvial erosion, together with the estimated area. This tool optimizes the detection and quantification of the phenomenon, facilitating decision making in risk management and territorial planning.

- **Summary**: Vision is an essential part of attitude control for many flying animals, some of which have no dedicated sense of gravity. Flying robots, on the other hand, typically depend heavily on accelerometers and gyroscopes for attitude stabilization. In this work, we present the first vision-only approach to flight control for use in generic environments. We show that a quadrotor drone equipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and rotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without inertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural network trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests demonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network is capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight control loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across different environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view. While networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best performance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative generalization. Our work showcases vision-only flight control as a promising candidate for enabling autonomous, insect-scale flying robots.

- **Summary**: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has received a lot of attention in surface reconstruction. However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes in the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type of splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent object surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that this can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality. Thus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian Splatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its surface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first propose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and rendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. In addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based initialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its surface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging different types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our framework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance.

- **Summary**: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the 3D-IRCADb-01 dataset obtains an average Dice of 87.45%, IoU of 80.30%, ASSD of 1.525 mm, and VOE of 19.71%, indicating strong generalization across different datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor segmentation.

- **Summary**: Learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods aim to predict depth maps for a sequence of calibrated images to recover dense point clouds. However, existing MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as textureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In contrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature matching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these regions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature and depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular foundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of the reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention mechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the monocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the depth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a relative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to supervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and Tanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate and Advanced benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Real-world user-generated videos, especially on platforms like TikTok, often feature rich and intertwined audio visual content. However, existing video captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric, overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight, capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets, UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities, featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in unconstrained real-world UGC settings.

- **Summary**: Face Recognition (FR) tasks have made significant progress with the advent of Deep Neural Networks, particularly through margin-based triplet losses that embed facial images into high-dimensional feature spaces. During training, these contrastive losses focus exclusively on identity information as labels. However, we observe a multiscale geometric structure emerging in the embedding space, influenced by interpretable facial (e.g., hair color) and image attributes (e.g., contrast). We propose a geometric approach to describe the dependence or invariance of FR models to these attributes and introduce a physics-inspired alignment metric. We evaluate the proposed metric on controlled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with synthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that the models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes, providing insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper interpretability.

- **Summary**: Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified 64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring, nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.

- **Summary**: Achieving equity in healthcare accessibility requires lightweight yet high-performance solutions for medical image segmentation, particularly in resource-limited settings. Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often suffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their ability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV, a novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV) architecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N) computational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the Direction-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan mechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional bias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational efficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature extraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic relationship capture. Experiments demonstrate that U-RWKV achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for democratizing advanced medical imaging technologies in resource-constrained environments.

- **Summary**: Vision AutoRegressive model (VAR) was recently introduced as an alternative to Diffusion Models (DMs) in image generation domain. In this work we focus on its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR.

- **Summary**: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images, thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios. To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images), a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First, recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm, mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.

- **Summary**: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are implicit neural networks with fixed points, which have recently gained attention for learning image regularization functionals, particularly in settings involving Gaussian fidelities, where assumptions on the forward operator ensure contractiveness of standard (proximal) Gradient Descent operators. In this work, we extend the application of DEQs to Poisson inverse problems, where the data fidelity term is more appropriately modeled by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To this end, we introduce a novel DEQ formulation based on Mirror Descent defined in terms of a tailored non-Euclidean geometry that naturally adapts with the structure of the data term. This enables the learning of neural regularizers within a principled training framework. We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee the convergence of the learned reconstruction scheme and propose computational strategies that enable both efficient training and fully parameter-free inference. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms traditional model-based approaches and it is comparable to the performance of Bregman Plug-and-Play methods, while mitigating their typical drawbacks - namely, sensitivity to initialization and careful tuning of hyperparameters.

- **Summary**: High-quality 3D assets are essential for various applications in computer graphics and 3D vision but remain scarce due to significant acquisition costs. To address this shortage, we introduce Elevate3D, a novel framework that transforms readily accessible low-quality 3D assets into higher quality. At the core of Elevate3D is HFS-SDEdit, a specialized texture enhancement method that significantly improves texture quality while preserving the appearance and geometry while fixing its degradations. Furthermore, Elevate3D operates in a view-by-view manner, alternating between texture and geometry refinement. Unlike previous methods that have largely overlooked geometry refinement, our framework leverages geometric cues from images refined with HFS-SDEdit by employing state-of-the-art monocular geometry predictors. This approach ensures detailed and accurate geometry that aligns seamlessly with the enhanced texture. Elevate3D outperforms recent competitors by achieving state-of-the-art quality in 3D model refinement, effectively addressing the scarcity of high-quality open-source 3D assets.

- **Summary**: Accurate characterization of vascular geometry is essential for cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional statistical shape modeling (SSM) methods rely on linear assumptions, limiting their expressivity and scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures. We introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular geometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with diffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained aortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the fundamental computer vision challenge of robust circle detection and fitting in degraded imaging conditions. We present Combinatorial Convolution-based Circle Fitting for Blurry Images (3C-FBI), an algorithm that bridges the gap between circle detection and precise parametric fitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling and (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.   We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world medical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos), (2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks, and (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier contamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3 fps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a standard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost 1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher than 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.   In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989 across contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al. (2024, 0.991), and surpassing RHT (0.964). This combination of accuracy, speed, and robustness makes 3C-FBI ideal for medical imaging, robotics, and industrial inspection under challenging conditions.

- **Summary**: Colors are omnipresent in today's world and play a vital role in how humans perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, it is challenging for computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization. Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical.

- **Summary**: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in various applications, such as motor imagery and cognitive state monitoring. However, decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel 5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking, (4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. We enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment and re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates high-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic alignment and image quality.

- **Summary**: In text-to-image generation, producing a series of consistent contents that preserve the same identity is highly valuable for real-world applications. Although a few works have explored training-free methods to enhance the consistency of generated subjects, we observe that they suffer from the following problems. First, they fail to maintain consistent background details, which limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character undergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing details become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist, which employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with decoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the generation of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in discrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first consistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability to maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of latest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs, broadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g., FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics, autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution, and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models": deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo, multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research and applications.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs, and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

- **Summary**: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node (LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP' achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85 +/- 0.05.

- **Summary**: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains. Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over 80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline. Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior analysis across various fields.

- **Summary**: Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in scenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different session or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the correlation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges, we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline, followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a 69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a compact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most memory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time implementation on resource-constrained platforms.

- **Summary**: Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning. However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty, and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes. Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

- **Summary**: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the field of LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. While solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed, LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced resimulation capabilities, such as generating high resolution LiDAR scans in the camera perspective.   Our code and the resulting dataset are available at https://github.com/richardmarcus/PBNLiDAR.

- **Summary**: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that (1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2) grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3) restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected in the masked image. Experiments on the DocVQA dataset demonstrate that our best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics but also enhances transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without additional model fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B, InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline (PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and evaluation code publicly.

- **Summary**: Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication, capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain, revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies, LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives. This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I systems. Content Warning: The paper includes sensitive content that may be harmful.

- **Summary**: Vision Mamba models promise transformer-level performance at linear computational cost, but their reliance on serializing 2D images into 1D sequences introduces a critical, yet overlooked, design choice: the patch scan order. In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong anatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first systematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures that facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational cost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public datasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our analysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant factor (Friedman test: $\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance varying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple horizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal scans. We conclude that scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter, and provide an evidence-based shortlist of optimal paths to maximize the performance of Mamba models in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures, which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver (UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

- **Summary**: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data. A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery (SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.
