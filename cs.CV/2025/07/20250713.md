- **Summary**: High-resolution image synthesis with diffusion models often suffers from energy instabilities and guidance artifacts that degrade visual quality. We analyze the latent energy landscape during sampling and propose adaptive classifier-free guidance (CFG) schedules that maintain stable energy trajectories. Our approach introduces energy-aware scheduling strategies that modulate guidance strength over time, achieving superior stability scores (0.9998) and consistency metrics (0.9873) compared to fixed-guidance approaches. We demonstrate that DPM++ 2M with linear-decreasing CFG scheduling yields optimal performance, providing sharper, more faithful images while reducing artifacts. Our energy profiling framework serves as a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding and improving diffusion model behavior.

- **Summary**: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual branches that learn local and global representations for individual and multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while significantly reducing the computational cost.

- **Summary**: Efficiently re-identifying and tracking objects across a network of cameras is crucial for applications like traffic surveillance. Spatula is the state-of-the-art video database management system (VDBMS) for processing Re-ID queries. However, it suffers from two limitations. Its spatio-temporal filtering scheme has limited accuracy on large camera networks due to localized camera history. It is not suitable for critical video analytics applications that require high recall due to a lack of support for adaptive query processing.   In this paper, we present Tracer, a novel VDBMS for efficiently processing Re-ID queries using an adaptive query processing framework. Tracer selects the optimal camera to process at each time step by training a recurrent network to model long-term historical correlations. To accelerate queries under a high recall constraint, Tracer incorporates a probabilistic adaptive search model that processes camera feeds in incremental search windows and dynamically updates the sampling probabilities using an exploration-exploitation strategy. To address the paucity of benchmarks for the Re-ID task due to privacy concerns, we present a novel synthetic benchmark for generating multi-camera Re-ID datasets based on real-world traffic distribution. Our evaluation shows that Tracer outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-camera analytics system by 3.9x on average across diverse datasets.

- **Summary**: We propose SegVec3D, a novel framework for 3D point cloud instance segmentation that integrates attention mechanisms, embedding learning, and cross-modal alignment. The approach builds a hierarchical feature extractor to enhance geometric structure modeling and enables unsupervised instance segmentation via contrastive clustering. It further aligns 3D data with natural language queries in a shared semantic space, supporting zero-shot retrieval. Compared to recent methods like Mask3D and ULIP, our method uniquely unifies instance segmentation and multimodal understanding with minimal supervision and practical deployability.

- **Summary**: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1) Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training. (2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

- **Summary**: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner. For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study, MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy. However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network (HMID-Net), a novel and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification and retrieval.

- **Summary**: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over 4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy, but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model, GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts, causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA) method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under real-world distribution shifts. Code: https://github.com/Evelyn1ywliang/ReTA.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team, HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

- **Summary**: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions. However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2% accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with existing DAT acceleration methods.

- **Summary**: The brain can only be fully understood through the lens of the behavior it generates -- a guiding principle in modern neuroscience research that nevertheless presents significant technical challenges. Many studies capture behavior with cameras, but video analysis approaches typically rely on specialized models requiring extensive labeled data. We address this limitation with BEAST (BEhavioral Analysis via Self-supervised pretraining of Transformers), a novel and scalable framework that pretrains experiment-specific vision transformers for diverse neuro-behavior analyses. BEAST combines masked autoencoding with temporal contrastive learning to effectively leverage unlabeled video data. Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple species, we demonstrate improved performance in three critical neuro-behavioral tasks: extracting behavioral features that correlate with neural activity, and pose estimation and action segmentation in both the single- and multi-animal settings. Our method establishes a powerful and versatile backbone model that accelerates behavioral analysis in scenarios where labeled data remains scarce.

  International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11% speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure, where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe, QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without compromising transferability.

- **Summary**: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas. Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important, some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module, complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal traffic prediction.



### Landmark Detection for Medical Images using a General-purpose Segmentation Model

- **Summary**: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics, with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization, which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code: https://github.com/ywxjm/DehazeSB.

- **Summary**: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model weights will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution for collaborative medical image classification while preserving data privacy. However, label noise, which arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric, extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for real-world medical federated learning scenarios.

- **Summary**: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing, industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network (DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets. Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy.

- **Summary**: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST) groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper, we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group. However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge. In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%.

- **Summary**: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation (EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available at https://github.com/SereinNout/EHPE.

- **Summary**: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods, have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation. We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality, stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative possibilities for artists and designers.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment, followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability. Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark, outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.

- **Summary**: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery, essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical surgical applications.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel framework for phase retrieval that leverages Langevin dynamics to enable efficient posterior sampling, yielding reconstructions that explicitly balance distortion and perceptual quality. Unlike conventional approaches that prioritize pixel-wise accuracy, our method navigates the perception-distortion tradeoff through a principled combination of stochastic sampling, learned denoising, and model-based updates. The framework comprises three variants of increasing complexity, integrating theoretically grounded Langevin inference, adaptive noise schedule learning, parallel reconstruction sampling, and warm-start initialization from classical solvers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, both in terms of fidelity and perceptual quality.

- **Summary**: Phase retrieval involves recovering a signal from intensity-only measurements, crucial in many fields such as imaging, holography, optical computing, crystallography, and microscopy. Although there are several well-known phase retrieval algorithms, including classical iterative solvers, the reconstruction performance often remains sensitive to initialization and measurement noise. Recently, image-to-image diffusion models have gained traction in various image reconstruction tasks, yielding significant theoretical insights and practical breakthroughs. In this work, we introduce a novel phase retrieval approach based on an image-to-image diffusion framework called Inversion by Direct Iteration. Our method begins with an enhanced initialization stage that leverages a hybrid iterative technique, combining the Hybrid Input-Output and Error Reduction methods and incorporating a novel acceleration mechanism to obtain a robust crude estimate. Then, it iteratively refines this initial crude estimate using the learned image-to-image pipeline. Our method achieves substantial improvements in both training efficiency and reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our approach utilizes aggregation techniques to refine quality metrics and demonstrates superior results compared to both classical and contemporary techniques. This highlights its potential for effective and efficient phase retrieval across various applications.

- **Summary**: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding (DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on CPU devices.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining. Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

- **Summary**: Deploying transformer-based neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices presents a significant challenge. This challenge is often addressed through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization (MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies, enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks, while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and classification.

- **Summary**: Next-generation wireless technologies such as 6G aim to meet demanding requirements such as ultra-high data rates, low latency, and enhanced connectivity. Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and energy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control over the wireless environment via passive reflective elements. However, realizing their full potential depends on accurate Channel State Information (CSI). Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated efficient cascaded channel estimation. However, the scalability and practical deployment of existing estimation models in XL-MIMO systems remain limited. The growing number of antennas and RIS elements introduces a significant barrier to real-time and efficient channel estimation, drastically increasing data volume, escalating computational complexity, requiring advanced hardware, and resulting in substantial energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for efficient cascaded channel estimation in XL-MIMO systems, designed to minimize computational complexity and make it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Using spatial correlations in the channel, we introduce a patch-based training mechanism that reduces the dimensionality of input to patch-level representations while preserving essential information, allowing scalable training for large-scale systems. Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our framework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational complexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in XL-MIMO systems.

- **Summary**: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework, particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

- **Summary**: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing (up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77% AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10% AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2 and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable healthcare solutions.

- **Summary**: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with: motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations, existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior. Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing previous approaches.

- **Summary**: WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints. To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric, outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset. Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks. The proposed system provides a reliable and privacy-aware solution for continuous human motion analysis in indoor environments. Our codes are available in https://github.com/CarmenQing/VST-Pose.

- **Summary**: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with < 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S. and Israel.

- **Summary**: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures, delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment instruction.

- **Summary**: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length, these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain. First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g., pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs. plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g., ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks for edge AI and AI agent applications.

- **Summary**: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual homing.

- **Summary**: Medical Imagings are considered one of the crucial diagnostic tools for different bones-related diseases, especially bones fractures. This paper investigates the robustness of pre-trained deep learning models for classifying bone fractures in X-ray images and seeks to address global healthcare disparity through the lens of technology. Three deep learning models have been tested under varying simulated equipment quality conditions. ResNet50, VGG16 and EfficientNetv2 are the three pre-trained architectures which are compared. These models were used to perform bone fracture classification as images were progressively degraded using noise. This paper specifically empirically studies how the noise can affect the bone fractures detection and how the pre-trained models performance can be changes due to the noise that affect the quality of the X-ray images. This paper aims to help replicate real world challenges experienced by medical imaging technicians across the world. Thus, this paper establishes a methodological framework for assessing AI model degradation using transfer learning and controlled noise augmentation. The findings provide practical insight into how robust and generalizable different pre-trained deep learning powered computer vision models can be when used in different contexts.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present the first foundational AI model for universal physics simulation that learns physical laws directly from boundary-condition data without requiring a priori equation encoding. Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions.   By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics simulation framework.

- **Summary**: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation (VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD). $L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

- **Summary**: Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in children under five, requiring accurate chest X-ray diagnosis. This study presents a machine learning-based Pediatric Chest Pneumonia Classification System to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The CNN-based model was trained on 5,863 labeled chest X-ray images from children aged 0-5 years from the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center. To address limited data, we applied augmentation techniques (rotation, zooming, shear, horizontal flipping) and employed GANs to generate synthetic images, addressing class imbalance. The system achieved optimal performance using combined original, augmented, and GAN-generated data, evaluated through accuracy and F1 score metrics. The final model was deployed via a Flask web application, enabling real-time classification with probability estimates. Results demonstrate the potential of deep learning and GANs in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency for pediatric pneumonia classification, particularly valuable in resource-limited clinical settings https://github.com/AbdulManaf12/Pediatric-Chest-Pneumonia-Classification

- **Summary**: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases, compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial) approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance improvements.

- **Summary**: Accurately estimating hand pose and hand-object contact events is essential for robot data-collection, immersive virtual environments, and biomechanical analysis, yet remains challenging due to visual occlusion, subtle contact cues, limitations in vision-only sensing, and the lack of accessible and flexible tactile sensing. We therefore introduce VibeMesh, a novel wearable system that fuses vision with active acoustic sensing for dense, per-vertex hand contact and pose estimation. VibeMesh integrates a bone-conduction speaker and sparse piezoelectric microphones, distributed on a human hand, emitting structured acoustic signals and capturing their propagation to infer changes induced by contact. To interpret these cross-modal signals, we propose a graph-based attention network that processes synchronized audio spectra and RGB-D-derived hand meshes to predict contact with high spatial resolution. We contribute: (i) a lightweight, non-intrusive visuo-acoustic sensing platform; (ii) a cross-modal graph network for joint pose and contact inference; (iii) a dataset of synchronized RGB-D, acoustic, and ground-truth contact annotations across diverse manipulation scenarios; and (iv) empirical results showing that VibeMesh outperforms vision-only baselines in accuracy and robustness, particularly in occluded or static-contact settings.

- **Summary**: Computer-aided design (CAD) is the digital construction of 2D and 3D objects, and is central to a wide range of engineering and manufacturing applications like automobile and aviation. Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information. Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. The code is available at https://github.com/ah-ansari/NegRefine.

- **Summary**: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories (with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

- **Summary**: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition. We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2). Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.
