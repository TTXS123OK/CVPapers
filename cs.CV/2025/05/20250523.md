- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as leading generative models for images and other modalities, but aligning their outputs with human preferences and safety constraints remains a critical challenge. This thesis proposal investigates methods to align diffusion models using reinforcement learning (RL) and reward modeling. We survey recent advances in fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models with human feedback, including reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback, direct preference optimization, and differentiable reward approaches. We classify these methods based on the type of feedback (human, automated, binary or ranked preferences), the fine-tuning technique (policy gradient, reward-weighted likelihood, direct backpropagation, etc.), and their efficiency and safety outcomes. We compare key algorithms and frameworks, highlighting how they improve alignment with user intent or safety standards, and discuss inter-relationships such as how newer methods build on or diverge from earlier ones. Based on the survey, we identify five promising research directions for the next two years: (1) multi-objective alignment with combined rewards, (2) efficient human feedback usage and active learning, (3) robust safety alignment against adversarial inputs, (4) continual and online alignment of diffusion models, and (5) interpretable and trustworthy reward modeling for generative images. Each direction is elaborated with its problem statement, challenges, related work, and a proposed research plan. The proposal is organized as a comprehensive document with literature review, comparative tables of methods, and detailed research plans, aiming to contribute new insights and techniques for safer and value-aligned diffusion-based generative AI.

- **Summary**: Ill-posed inverse problems are fundamental in many domains, ranging from astrophysics to medical imaging. Emerging diffusion models provide a powerful prior for solving these problems. Existing maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) or posterior sampling approaches, however, rely on different computational approximations, leading to inaccurate or suboptimal samples. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach to solving MAP problems with diffusion model priors using a dual ascent optimization framework. Our framework achieves better image quality as measured by various metrics for image restoration problems, it is more robust to high levels of measurement noise, it is faster, and it estimates solutions that represent the observations more faithfully than the state of the art.

- **Summary**: With the rise of IoT-based botnet attacks, researchers have explored various learning models for detection, including traditional machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid approaches. A key advancement involves deploying attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies among features, significantly improving detection accuracy. However, most models treat attack instances independently, overlooking inter-instance relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) address this limitation by learning an embedding space via iterative message passing where similar instances are placed closer based on node features and relationships, enhancing classification performance. To further improve detection, attention mechanisms have been embedded within GNNs, leveraging both long-range dependencies and inter-instance connections. However, transforming the high dimensional IoT attack datasets into a graph structured dataset poses challenges, such as large graph structures leading computational overhead. To mitigate this, this paper proposes a framework that first reduces dimensionality of the NetFlow-based IoT attack dataset before transforming it into a graph dataset. We evaluate three dimension reduction techniques--Variational Autoencoder (VAE-encoder), classical autoencoder (AE-encoder), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)--and compare their effects on a Graph Attention neural network (GAT) model for botnet attack detection

- **Summary**: Recent monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) methods have made notable progress towards zero-shot generalization. However, they still exhibit a significant performance drop on out-of-distribution datasets. We address this limitation by injecting defocus blur cues at inference time into Marigold, a \textit{pre-trained} diffusion model for zero-shot, scale-invariant monocular depth estimation (MDE). Our method effectively turns Marigold into a metric depth predictor in a training-free manner. To incorporate defocus cues, we capture two images with a small and a large aperture from the same viewpoint. To recover metric depth, we then optimize the metric depth scaling parameters and the noise latents of Marigold at inference time using gradients from a loss function based on the defocus-blur image formation model. We compare our method against existing state-of-the-art zero-shot MMDE methods on a self-collected real dataset, showing quantitative and qualitative improvements.

- **Summary**: Due to the exponential rise in IoT-based botnet attacks, researchers have explored various advanced techniques for both dimensionality reduction and attack detection to enhance IoT security. Among these, Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Vision Transformers (ViT), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN), including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), have garnered significant research attention in the domain of attack detection. This study evaluates the effectiveness of four state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for IoT botnet detection: a VAE encoder with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a VAE encoder with a GCN, a VAE encoder with a GAT, and a ViT encoder with an MLP. The evaluation is conducted on a widely studied IoT benchmark dataset--the N-BaIoT dataset for both binary and multiclass tasks. For the binary classification task, all models achieved over 99.93% in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, with no notable differences in performance. In contrast, for the multiclass classification task, GNN-based models showed significantly lower performance compared to VAE-MLP and ViT-MLP, with accuracies of 86.42%, 89.46%, 99.72%, and 98.38% for VAE-GCN, VAE-GAT, VAE-MLP, and ViT-MLP, respectively.

- **Summary**: Parking space occupancy detection is a critical component in the development of intelligent parking management systems. Traditional object detection approaches, such as YOLOv8, provide fast and accurate vehicle detection across parking lots but can struggle with borderline cases, such as partially visible vehicles, small vehicles (e.g., motorcycles), and poor lighting conditions. In this work, we perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of customized backbone architectures integrated with YOLOv8. Specifically, we evaluate various backbones -- ResNet-18, VGG16, EfficientNetV2, Ghost -- on the PKLot dataset in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results highlight each architecture's strengths and trade-offs, providing insight into selecting suitable models for parking occupancy.

- **Summary**: Medical image classification is critical for clinical decision-making, yet demands for accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability remain challenging. This paper introduces EVM-Fusion, an Explainable Vision Mamba architecture featuring a novel Neural Algorithmic Fusion (NAF) mechanism for multi-organ medical image classification. EVM-Fusion leverages a multipath design, where DenseNet and U-Net based pathways, enhanced by Vision Mamba (Vim) modules, operate in parallel with a traditional feature pathway. These diverse features are dynamically integrated via a two-stage fusion process: cross-modal attention followed by the iterative NAF block, which learns an adaptive fusion algorithm. Intrinsic explainability is embedded through path-specific spatial attention, Vim {\Delta}-value maps, traditional feature SE-attention, and cross-modal attention weights. Experiments on a diverse 9-class multi-organ medical image dataset demonstrate EVM-Fusion's strong classification performance, achieving 99.75% test accuracy and provide multi-faceted insights into its decision-making process, highlighting its potential for trustworthy AI in medical diagnostics.

- **Summary**: Discrete diffusion models have recently shown great promise for modeling complex discrete data, with masked diffusion models (MDMs) offering a compelling trade-off between quality and generation speed. MDMs denoise by progressively unmasking multiple dimensions from an all-masked input, but their performance can degrade when using few denoising steps due to limited modeling of inter-dimensional dependencies. In this paper, we propose Variational Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion (VADD), a novel framework that enhances discrete diffusion with latent variable modeling to implicitly capture correlations among dimensions. By introducing an auxiliary recognition model, VADD enables stable training via variational lower bounds maximization and amortized inference over the training set. Our approach retains the efficiency of traditional MDMs while significantly improving sample quality, especially when the number of denoising steps is small. Empirical results on 2D toy data, pixel-level image generation, and text generation demonstrate that VADD consistently outperforms MDM baselines.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a novel dual-sensing driver fatigue detection method combining computer vision and physiological signal analysis is proposed. The system exploits the complementary advantages of the two sensing modalities and breaks through the limitations of existing single-modality methods. We introduce an innovative architecture that combines real-time facial feature analysis with physiological signal processing, combined with advanced fusion strategies, for robust fatigue detection. The system is designed to run efficiently on existing hardware while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional methods in both controlled environments and real-world conditions, while maintaining high accuracy. The practical applicability of the system has been verified through extensive tests in various driving scenarios and shows great potential in reducing fatigue-related accidents. This study contributes to the field by providing a more reliable, cost-effective, and humane solution for driver fatigue detection.

- **Summary**: The critical need for sophisticated detection techniques has been highlighted by the rising frequency and intensity of wildfires in the US, especially in California. In 2023, wildfires caused 130 deaths nationwide, the highest since 1990. In January 2025, Los Angeles wildfires which included the Palisades and Eaton fires burnt approximately 40,000 acres and 12,000 buildings, and caused loss of human lives. The devastation underscores the urgent need for effective detection and prevention strategies. Deep learning models, such as Vision Transformers (ViTs), can enhance early detection by processing complex image data with high accuracy. However, wildfire detection faces challenges, including the availability of high-quality, real-time data. Wildfires often occur in remote areas with limited sensor coverage, and environmental factors like smoke and cloud cover can hinder detection. Additionally, training deep learning models is computationally expensive, and issues like false positives/negatives and scaling remain concerns. Integrating detection systems with real-time alert mechanisms also poses difficulties. In this work, we used the wildfire dataset consisting of 10.74 GB high-resolution images categorized into 'fire' and 'nofire' classes is used for training the ViT model. To prepare the data, images are resized to 224 x 224 pixels, converted into tensor format, and normalized using ImageNet statistics.

- **Summary**: High-fidelity 3D reconstruction is critical for aerial inspection tasks such as infrastructure monitoring, structural assessment, and environmental surveying. While traditional photogrammetry techniques enable geometric modeling, they lack semantic interpretability, limiting their effectiveness for automated inspection workflows. Recent advances in neural rendering and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer efficient, photorealistic reconstructions but similarly lack scene-level understanding.   In this work, we present a UAV-based pipeline that extends Feature-3DGS for language-guided 3D segmentation. We leverage LSeg-based feature fields with CLIP embeddings to generate heatmaps in response to language prompts. These are thresholded to produce rough segmentations, and the highest-scoring point is then used as a prompt to SAM or SAM2 for refined 2D segmentation on novel view renderings. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of various feature field backbones (CLIP-LSeg, SAM, SAM2) in capturing meaningful structure in large-scale outdoor environments. We demonstrate that this hybrid approach enables flexible, language-driven interaction with photorealistic 3D reconstructions, opening new possibilities for semantic aerial inspection and scene understanding.

- **Summary**: Generating high resolution 3D shapes using volumetric representations such as Signed Distance Functions presents substantial computational and memory challenges. We introduce Direct3D S2, a scalable 3D generation framework based on sparse volumes that achieves superior output quality with dramatically reduced training costs. Our key innovation is the Spatial Sparse Attention mechanism, which greatly enhances the efficiency of Diffusion Transformer computations on sparse volumetric data. SSA allows the model to effectively process large token sets within sparse volumes, significantly reducing computational overhead and achieving a 3.9x speedup in the forward pass and a 9.6x speedup in the backward pass. Our framework also includes a variational autoencoder that maintains a consistent sparse volumetric format across input, latent, and output stages. Compared to previous methods with heterogeneous representations in 3D VAE, this unified design significantly improves training efficiency and stability. Our model is trained on public available datasets, and experiments demonstrate that Direct3D S2 not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generation quality and efficiency, but also enables training at 1024 resolution using only 8 GPUs, a task typically requiring at least 32 GPUs for volumetric representations at 256 resolution, thus making gigascale 3D generation both practical and accessible.

- **Summary**: Many decision-making tasks, where both accuracy and efficiency matter, still require human supervision. For example, tasks like traffic officers reviewing hour-long dashcam footage or researchers screening conference videos can benefit from concise summaries that reduce cognitive load and save time. Yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often produce verbose, redundant outputs that hinder task performance. Existing video caption evaluation depends on costly human annotations and overlooks the summaries' utility in downstream tasks. We address these gaps with Video-to-text Information Bottleneck Evaluation (VIBE), an annotation-free method that scores VLM outputs using two metrics: grounding (how well the summary aligns with visual content) and utility (how informative it is for the task). VIBE selects from randomly sampled VLM outputs by ranking them according to the two scores to support effective human decision-making. Human studies on LearningPaper24, SUTD-TrafficQA, and LongVideoBench show that summaries selected by VIBE consistently improve performance-boosting task accuracy by up to 61.23% and reducing response time by 75.77% compared to naive VLM summaries or raw video.

- **Summary**: Multimodal models like CLIP have gained significant attention due to their remarkable zero-shot performance across various tasks. However, studies have revealed that CLIP can inadvertently learn spurious associations between target variables and confounding factors. To address this, we introduce \textsc{Locate-Then-Correct} (LTC), a contrastive framework that identifies spurious attention heads in Vision Transformers via mechanistic insights and mitigates them through targeted ablation. Furthermore, LTC identifies salient, task-relevant attention heads, enabling the integration of discriminative features through orthogonal projection to improve classification performance. We evaluate LTC on benchmarks with inherent background and gender biases, achieving over a $>50\%$ gain in worst-group accuracy compared to non-training post-hoc baselines. Additionally, we visualize the representation of selected heads and find that the presented interpretation corroborates our contrastive mechanism for identifying both spurious and salient attention heads.

- **Summary**: The widespread adoption of mobile devices and data collection technologies has led to an exponential increase in trajectory data, presenting significant challenges in spatio-temporal data mining, particularly for efficient and accurate trajectory retrieval. However, existing methods for trajectory retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories, topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream tasks and applications.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation, yet their vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises significant robustness concerns. While existing effective attacks always focus on task-specific white-box settings, these approaches are limited in the context of LVLMs, which are designed for diverse downstream tasks and require expensive full-model gradient computations. Motivated by the pivotal role and wide adoption of the vision encoder in LVLMs, we propose a simple yet effective Vision Encoder Attack (VEAttack), which targets the vision encoder of LVLMs only. Specifically, we propose to generate adversarial examples by minimizing the cosine similarity between the clean and perturbed visual features, without accessing the following large language models, task information, and labels. It significantly reduces the computational overhead while eliminating the task and label dependence of traditional white-box attacks in LVLMs. To make this simple attack effective, we propose to perturb images by optimizing image tokens instead of the classification token. We provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that VEAttack can easily generalize to various tasks. VEAttack has achieved a performance degradation of 94.5% on image caption task and 75.7% on visual question answering task. We also reveal some key observations to provide insights into LVLM attack/defense: 1) hidden layer variations of LLM, 2) token attention differential, 3) M\"obius band in transfer attack, 4) low sensitivity to attack steps.

- **Summary**: Regarding intelligent transportation systems for vehicle networking, low-bitrate transmission via lossy point cloud compression is vital for facilitating real-time collaborative perception among vehicles with restricted bandwidth. In existing compression transmission systems, the sender lossily compresses point coordinates and reflectance to generate a transmission code stream, which faces transmission burdens from reflectance encoding and limited detection robustness due to information loss. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 3D object detection framework with reflectance prediction-based knowledge distillation (RPKD). We compress point coordinates while discarding reflectance during low-bitrate transmission, and feed the decoded non-reflectance compressed point clouds into a student detector. The discarded reflectance is then reconstructed by a geometry-based reflectance prediction (RP) module within the student detector for precise detection. A teacher detector with the same structure as student detector is designed for performing reflectance knowledge distillation (RKD) and detection knowledge distillation (DKD) from raw to compressed point clouds. Our RPKD framework jointly trains detectors on both raw and compressed point clouds to improve the student detector's robustness. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method can boost detection accuracy for compressed point clouds across multiple code rates. Notably, at a low code rate of 2.146 Bpp on the KITTI dataset, our RPKD-PV achieves the highest mAP of 73.6, outperforming existing detection methods with the PV-RCNN baseline.

- **Summary**: In the United States, as of 2023, pet ownership has reached 66% of households and continues to rise annually. This trend underscores the critical need for effective pet identification and monitoring methods, particularly as nearly 10 million cats and dogs are reported stolen or lost each year. However, traditional methods for finding lost animals like GPS tags or ID photos have limitations-they can be removed, face signal issues, and depend on someone finding and reporting the pet. To address these limitations, we introduce PawPrint and PawPrint+, the first publicly available datasets focused on individual-level footprint identification for dogs and cats. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both modern deep neural networks (e.g., CNN, Transformers) and classical local features, we observe varying advantages and drawbacks depending on substrate complexity and data availability. These insights suggest future directions for combining learned global representations with local descriptors to enhance reliability across diverse, real-world conditions. As this approach provides a non-invasive alternative to traditional ID tags, we anticipate promising applications in ethical pet management and wildlife conservation efforts.

- **Summary**: Following the rising popularity of YouTube, there is an emerging problem on this platform called clickbait, which provokes users to click on videos using attractive titles and thumbnails. As a result, users ended up watching a video that does not have the content as publicized in the title. This issue is addressed in this study by proposing an algorithm called BaitRadar, which uses a deep learning technique where six inference models are jointly consulted to make the final classification decision. These models focus on different attributes of the video, including title, comments, thumbnail, tags, video statistics and audio transcript. The final classification is attained by computing the average of multiple models to provide a robust and accurate output even in situation where there is missing data. The proposed method is tested on 1,400 YouTube videos. On average, a test accuracy of 98% is achieved with an inference time of less than 2s.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of anticipating traffic accidents, which aims to forecast potential accidents before they happen. Real-time anticipation is crucial for safe autonomous driving, yet most methods rely on computationally heavy modules like optical flow and intermediate feature extractors, making real-world deployment challenging. In this paper, we thus introduce RARE (Real-time Accident anticipation with Reused Embeddings), a lightweight framework that capitalizes on intermediate features from a single pre-trained object detector. By eliminating additional feature-extraction pipelines, RARE significantly reduces latency. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Attention Score Ranking Loss, which prioritizes higher attention on accident-related objects over non-relevant ones. This loss enhances both accuracy and interpretability. RARE demonstrates a 4-8 times speedup over existing approaches on the DAD and CCD benchmarks, achieving a latency of 13.6ms per frame (73.3 FPS) on an RTX 6000. Moreover, despite its reduced complexity, it attains state-of-the-art Average Precision and reliably anticipates imminent collisions in real time. These results highlight RARE's potential for safety-critical applications where timely and explainable anticipation is essential.

- **Summary**: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology present a significant challenge for large-scale medical image analysis due to their high resolution, large size, and complex tile relationships. Existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based models, face limitations in scalability and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose the WSI-GMamba framework, which synergistically combines the relational modeling strengths of GNNs with the efficiency of Mamba, the State Space Model designed for sequence learning. The proposed GMamba block integrates Message Passing, Graph Scanning & Flattening, and feature aggregation via a Bidirectional State Space Model (Bi-SSM), achieving Transformer-level performance with 7* fewer FLOPs. By leveraging the complementary strengths of lightweight GNNs and Mamba, the WSI-GMamba framework delivers a scalable solution for large-scale WSI analysis, offering both high accuracy and computational efficiency for slide-level classification.

- **Summary**: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly being applied to a wide range of real-world multimodal applications, involving complex visual and linguistic reasoning. As these models become more integrated into practical use, they are expected to handle complex aspects of human interaction. Among these, color perception is a fundamental yet highly variable aspect of visual understanding. It differs across individuals due to biological factors such as Color Vision Deficiencies (CVDs), as well as differences in culture and language. Despite its importance, perceptual diversity has received limited attention. In our study, we evaluate LVLMs' ability to account for individual level perceptual variation using the Ishihara Test, a widely used method for detecting CVDs. Our results show that LVLMs can explain CVDs in natural language, but they cannot simulate how people with CVDs perceive color in image based tasks. These findings highlight the need for multimodal systems that can account for color perceptual diversity and support broader discussions on perceptual inclusiveness and fairness in multimodal AI.

- **Summary**: High-quality 3D fetal brain MRI reconstruction from motion-corrupted 2D slices is crucial for clinical diagnosis. Reliable slice-to-volume registration (SVR)-based motion correction and super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods are essential. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing SVR and SRR when compared to conventional methods. However, it requires large-scale external training datasets, which are difficult to obtain for clinical fetal MRI. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised iterative SVR-SRR framework for isotropic HR volume reconstruction. Specifically, SVR is formulated as a function mapping a 2D slice and a 3D target volume to a rigid transformation matrix, which aligns the slice to the underlying location in the target volume. The function is parameterized by a convolutional neural network, which is trained by minimizing the difference between the volume slicing at the predicted position and the input slice. In SRR, a decoding network embedded within a deep image prior framework is incorporated with a comprehensive image degradation model to produce the high-resolution (HR) volume. The deep image prior framework offers a local consistency prior to guide the reconstruction of HR volumes. By performing a forward degradation model, the HR volume is optimized by minimizing loss between predicted slices and the observed slices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on large-magnitude motion-corrupted simulation data and clinical data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art fetal brain reconstruction frameworks.

- **Summary**: Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication contexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements, including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce OrionBench, a benchmark designed to support the development of accurate object detection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 26,250 real and 78,750 synthetic infographics, with over 6.9 million bounding box annotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop and programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of OrionBench through three applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the chart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection models, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI element detection.

- **Summary**: We study multi-dataset training (MDT) for pose estimation, where skeletal heterogeneity presents a unique challenge that existing methods have yet to address. In traditional domains, \eg regression and classification, MDT typically relies on dataset merging or multi-head supervision. However, the diversity of skeleton types and limited cross-dataset supervision complicate integration in pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce PoseBH, a new MDT framework that tackles keypoint heterogeneity and limited supervision through two key techniques. First, we propose nonparametric keypoint prototypes that learn within a unified embedding space, enabling seamless integration across skeleton types. Second, we develop a cross-type self-supervision mechanism that aligns keypoint predictions with keypoint embedding prototypes, providing supervision without relying on teacher-student models or additional augmentations. PoseBH substantially improves generalization across whole-body and animal pose datasets, including COCO-WholeBody, AP-10K, and APT-36K, while preserving performance on standard human pose benchmarks (COCO, MPII, and AIC). Furthermore, our learned keypoint embeddings transfer effectively to hand shape estimation (InterHand2.6M) and human body shape estimation (3DPW).

- **Summary**: The detection and grounding of multimedia manipulation has emerged as a critical challenge in combating AI-generated disinformation. While existing methods have made progress in recent years, we identify two fundamental limitations in current approaches: (1) Underestimation of MLLM-driven deception risk: prevailing techniques primarily address rule-based text manipulations, yet fail to account for sophisticated misinformation synthesized by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can dynamically generate semantically coherent, contextually plausible yet deceptive narratives conditioned on manipulated images; (2) Unrealistic misalignment artifacts: currently focused scenarios rely on artificially misaligned content that lacks semantic coherence, rendering them easily detectable. To address these gaps holistically, we propose a new adversarial pipeline that leverages MLLMs to generate high-risk disinformation. Our approach begins with constructing the MLLM-Driven Synthetic Multimodal (MDSM) dataset, where images are first altered using state-of-the-art editing techniques and then paired with MLLM-generated deceptive texts that maintain semantic consistency with the visual manipulations. Building upon this foundation, we present the Artifact-aware Manipulation Diagnosis via MLLM (AMD) framework featuring two key innovations: Artifact Pre-perception Encoding strategy and Manipulation-Oriented Reasoning, to tame MLLMs for the MDSM problem. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's superior generalization capabilities as a unified architecture for detecting MLLM-powered multimodal deceptions.

- **Summary**: Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorders (PAS) pose significant risks during pregnancy, frequently leading to postpartum hemorrhage during cesarean deliveries and other severe clinical complications, with bleeding severity correlating to the degree of placental invasion. Consequently, accurate prenatal diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes-placenta accreta (PA), placenta increta (PI), and placenta percreta (PP)-is crucial. However, existing guidelines and methodologies predominantly focus on the presence of PAS, with limited research addressing subtype recognition. Additionally, previous multi-class diagnostic efforts have primarily relied on inefficient two-stage cascaded binary classification tasks. In this study, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for efficient one-stage multiclass diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes, based on 4,140 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slices. Our model features two branches: the main classification branch utilizes a residual block architecture comprising multiple residual blocks, while the second branch integrates anatomical features of the uteroplacental area and the adjacent uterine serous layer to enhance the model's attention during classification. Furthermore, we implement a multitask learning strategy to leverage both branches effectively. Experiments conducted on a real clinical dataset demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: The motor control board has various defects such as inconsistent color differences, incorrect plug-in positions, solder short circuits, and more. These defects directly affect the performance and stability of the motor control board, thereby having a negative impact on product quality. Therefore, studying the defect detection technology of the motor control board is an important means to improve the quality control level of the motor control board. Firstly, the processing methods of digital images about the motor control board were studied, and the noise suppression methods that affect image feature extraction were analyzed. Secondly, a specific model for defect feature extraction and color difference recognition of the tested motor control board was established, and qualified or defective products were determined based on feature thresholds. Thirdly, the search algorithm for defective images was optimized. Finally, comparative experiments were conducted on the typical motor control board, and the experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of the motor control board defect detection model-based on image processing established in this paper reached over 99%. It is suitable for timely image processing of large quantities of motor control boards on the production line, and achieved efficient defect detection. The defect detection method can not only be used for online detection of the motor control board defects, but also provide solutions for the integrated circuit board defect processing for the industry.

- **Summary**: Multimodal emotion recognition analyzes emotions by combining data from multiple sources. However, real-world noise or sensor failures often cause missing or corrupted data, creating the Incomplete Multimodal Emotion Recognition (IMER) challenge. In this paper, we propose Robust Hybrid Diffusion Recovery (RoHyDR), a novel framework that performs missing-modality recovery at unimodal, multimodal, feature, and semantic levels. For unimodal representation recovery of missing modalities, RoHyDR exploits a diffusion-based generator to generate distribution-consistent and semantically aligned representations from Gaussian noise, using available modalities as conditioning. For multimodal fusion recovery, we introduce adversarial learning to produce a realistic fused multimodal representation and recover missing semantic content. We further propose a multi-stage optimization strategy that enhances training stability and efficiency. In contrast to previous work, the hybrid diffusion and adversarial learning-based recovery mechanism in RoHyDR allows recovery of missing information in both unimodal representation and multimodal fusion, at both feature and semantic levels, effectively mitigating performance degradation caused by suboptimal optimization. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two widely used multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art IMER methods, achieving robust recognition performance under various missing-modality scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Large pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) have excellent generalization capabilities but are highly susceptible to adversarial examples, presenting potential security risks. To improve the robustness of VLMs against adversarial examples, adversarial prompt tuning methods are proposed to align the text feature with the adversarial image feature without changing model parameters. However, when facing various adversarial attacks, a single learnable text prompt has insufficient generalization to align well with all adversarial image features, which finally leads to the overfitting phenomenon. To address the above challenge, in this paper, we empirically find that increasing the number of learned prompts can bring more robustness improvement than a longer prompt. Then we propose an adversarial tuning method named Adversarial Mixture Prompt Tuning (AMPT) to enhance the generalization towards various adversarial attacks for VLMs. AMPT aims to learn mixture text prompts to obtain more robust text features. To further enhance the adaptability, we propose a conditional weight router based on the input adversarial image to predict the mixture weights of multiple learned prompts, which helps obtain sample-specific aggregated text features aligning with different adversarial image features. A series of experiments show that our method can achieve better adversarial robustness than state-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets under different experimental settings.



### DECT-based Space-Squeeze Method for Multi-Class Classification of Metastatic Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer

- **Summary**: Background: Accurate assessment of metastatic burden in axillary lymph nodes is crucial for guiding breast cancer treatment decisions, yet conventional imaging modalities struggle to differentiate metastatic burden levels and capture comprehensive lymph node characteristics. This study leverages dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to exploit spectral-spatial information for improved multi-class classification. Purpose: To develop a noninvasive DECT-based model classifying sentinel lymph nodes into three categories: no metastasis ($N_0$), low metastatic burden ($N_{+(1-2)}$), and heavy metastatic burden ($N_{+(\geq3)}$), thereby aiding therapeutic planning. Methods: We propose a novel space-squeeze method combining two innovations: (1) a channel-wise attention mechanism to compress and recalibrate spectral-spatial features across 11 energy levels, and (2) virtual class injection to sharpen inter-class boundaries and compact intra-class variations in the representation space. Results: Evaluated on 227 biopsy-confirmed cases, our method achieved an average test AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91) across three cross-validation folds, outperforming established CNNs (VGG, ResNet, etc). The channel-wise attention and virtual class components individually improved AUC by 5.01% and 5.87%, respectively, demonstrating complementary benefits. Conclusions: The proposed framework enhances diagnostic AUC by effectively integrating DECT's spectral-spatial data and mitigating class ambiguity, offering a promising tool for noninvasive metastatic burden assessment in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly expanded their utility in tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. However, they still struggle with object hallucination, where models generate descriptions that inaccurately reflect the visual content by including nonexistent objects or misrepresenting existing ones. While previous methods, such as data augmentation and training-free approaches, strive to tackle this issue, they still encounter scalability challenges and often depend on additional external modules. In this work, we propose Ensemble Decoding (ED), a novel strategy that splits the input image into sub-images and combines logit distributions by assigning weights through the attention map. Furthermore, we introduce ED adaptive plausibility constraint to calibrate logit distribution and FastED, a variant designed for speed-critical applications. Extensive experiments across hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a pioneering exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) via group relative policy optimization for unified multimodal large language models (ULMs), aimed at simultaneously reinforcing generation and understanding capabilities. Through systematic pilot studies, we uncover the significant potential of ULMs to enable the synergistic co-evolution of dual capabilities within a shared policy optimization framework. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{CoRL}, a co-reinforcement learning framework comprising a unified RL stage for joint optimization and a refined RL stage for task-specific enhancement. With the proposed CoRL, our resulting model, \textbf{ULM-R1}, achieves average improvements of \textbf{7%} on three text-to-image generation datasets and \textbf{23%} on nine multimodal understanding benchmarks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRL and highlight the substantial benefit of reinforcement learning in facilitating cross-task synergy and optimization for ULMs.

- **Summary**: Despite recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation, existing models often struggle to faithfully capture user intentions from short and under-specified prompts. While prior work has attempted to enhance prompts using large language models (LLMs), these methods frequently generate stylistic or unrealistic content due to insufficient grounding in visual semantics and real-world composition. Inspired by recent advances in reasoning for language model, we propose RePrompt, a novel reprompting framework that introduces explicit reasoning into the prompt enhancement process via reinforcement learning. Instead of relying on handcrafted rules or stylistic rewrites, our method trains a language model to generate structured, self-reflective prompts by optimizing for image-level outcomes. The tailored reward models assesse the generated images in terms of human preference, semantic alignment, and visual composition, providing indirect supervision to refine prompt generation. Our approach enables end-to-end training without human-annotated data. Experiments on GenEval and T2I-Compbench show that RePrompt significantly boosts spatial layout fidelity and compositional generalization across diverse T2I backbones, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation faces persistent challenges due to severe class imbalance and the frequency-specific distribution of anatomical structures. Most conventional CNN-based methods operate in the spatial domain and struggle to capture minority class signals, often affected by frequency aliasing and limited spectral selectivity. Transformer-based models, while powerful in modeling global dependencies, tend to overlook critical local details necessary for fine-grained segmentation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FreqU-FNet, a novel U-shaped segmentation architecture operating in the frequency domain. Our framework incorporates a Frequency Encoder that leverages Low-Pass Frequency Convolution and Daubechies wavelet-based downsampling to extract multi-scale spectral features. To reconstruct fine spatial details, we introduce a Spatial Learnable Decoder (SLD) equipped with an adaptive multi-branch upsampling strategy. Furthermore, we design a frequency-aware loss (FAL) function to enhance minority class learning. Extensive experiments on multiple medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that FreqU-FNet consistently outperforms both CNN and Transformer baselines, particularly in handling under-represented classes, by effectively exploiting discriminative frequency bands.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have significantly enhanced the quality of generated videos. However, their ability to produce explicit or harmful content raises concerns about misuse and potential rights violations. Inspired by the success of unlearning techniques in erasing undesirable concepts from text-to-image (T2I) models, we extend unlearning to T2V models and propose a robust and precise unlearning method. Specifically, we adopt negatively-guided velocity prediction fine-tuning and enhance it with prompt augmentation to ensure robustness against LLM-refined prompts. To achieve precise unlearning, we incorporate a localization and a preservation regularization to preserve the model's ability to generate non-target concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively erases a specific concept while preserving the model's generation capability for all other concepts, outperforming existing methods. We provide the unlearned models in \href{https://github.com/VDIGPKU/T2VUnlearning.git}{https://github.com/VDIGPKU/T2VUnlearning.git}.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in the inspection of industrial images. Most existing methods require separate models for each category, resulting in multiplied deployment costs. This highlights the challenge of developing a unified model for multi-class anomaly detection. However, the significant increase in inter-class interference leads to severe missed detections. Furthermore, the intra-class overlap between normal and abnormal samples, particularly in synthesis-based methods, cannot be ignored and may lead to over-detection. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Center-aware Residual Anomaly Synthesis (CRAS) method for multi-class anomaly detection. CRAS leverages center-aware residual learning to couple samples from different categories into a unified center, mitigating the effects of inter-class interference. To further reduce intra-class overlap, CRAS introduces distance-guided anomaly synthesis that adaptively adjusts noise variance based on normal data distribution. Experimental results on diverse datasets and real-world industrial applications demonstrate the superior detection accuracy and competitive inference speed of CRAS. The source code and the newly constructed dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CRAS.

- **Summary**: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) aims to detect the start and end timestamps of actions in a video. However, the training of TAL models requires a substantial amount of manually annotated data. Data programming is an efficient method to create training labels with a series of human-defined labeling functions. However, its application in TAL faces difficulties of defining complex actions in the context of temporal video frames. In this paper, we propose ProTAL, a drag-and-link video programming framework for TAL. ProTAL enables users to define \textbf{key events} by dragging nodes representing body parts and objects and linking them to constrain the relations (direction, distance, etc.). These definitions are used to generate action labels for large-scale unlabelled videos. A semi-supervised method is then employed to train TAL models with such labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProTAL through a usage scenario and a user study, providing insights into designing video programming framework.

- **Summary**: Accurate prediction of wildfire spread is crucial for effective risk management, emergency response, and strategic resource allocation. In this study, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework for forecasting the final extent of burned areas, using data available at the time of ignition. We leverage a spatio-temporal dataset that covers the Mediterranean region from 2006 to 2022, incorporating remote sensing data, meteorological observations, vegetation maps, land cover classifications, anthropogenic factors, topography data, and thermal anomalies. To evaluate the influence of temporal context, we conduct an ablation study examining how the inclusion of pre- and post-ignition data affects model performance, benchmarking the temporal-aware DL models against a baseline trained exclusively on ignition-day inputs. Our results indicate that multi-day observational data substantially improve predictive accuracy. Particularly, the best-performing model, incorporating a temporal window of four days before to five days after ignition, improves both the F1 score and the Intersection over Union by almost 5% in comparison to the baseline on the test dataset. We publicly release our dataset and models to enhance research into data-driven approaches for wildfire modeling and response.

- **Summary**: Despite the impressive performance of generative Diffusion Models (DMs), their internal working is still not well understood, which is potentially problematic. This paper focuses on exploring the important notion of bias-variance tradeoff in diffusion models. Providing a systematic foundation for this exploration, it establishes that at one extreme the diffusion models may amplify the inherent bias in the training data and, on the other, they may compromise the presumed privacy of the training samples. Our exploration aligns with the memorization-generalization understanding of the generative models, but it also expands further along this spectrum beyond ``generalization'', revealing the risk of bias amplification in deeper models. Building on the insights, we also introduce a training-free method to improve output quality in text-to-image and image-to-image generation. By progressively encouraging temporary high variance in the generation process with partial bypassing of the mid-block's contribution in the denoising process of DMs, our method consistently improves generative image quality with zero training cost. Our claims are validated both theoretically and empirically.

- **Summary**: The choice of initial noise significantly affects the quality and prompt alignment of video diffusion models, where different noise seeds for the same prompt can lead to drastically different generations. While recent methods rely on externally designed priors such as frequency filters or inter-frame smoothing, they often overlook internal model signals that indicate which noise seeds are inherently preferable. To address this, we propose ANSE (Active Noise Selection for Generation), a model-aware framework that selects high-quality noise seeds by quantifying attention-based uncertainty. At its core is BANSA (Bayesian Active Noise Selection via Attention), an acquisition function that measures entropy disagreement across multiple stochastic attention samples to estimate model confidence and consistency. For efficient inference-time deployment, we introduce a Bernoulli-masked approximation of BANSA that enables score estimation using a single diffusion step and a subset of attention layers. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B and 5B demonstrate that ANSE improves video quality and temporal coherence with only an 8% and 13% increase in inference time, respectively, providing a principled and generalizable approach to noise selection in video diffusion.

- **Summary**: In radar systems, high resolution in the Doppler dimension is important for detecting slow-moving targets as it allows for more distinct separation between these targets and clutter, or stationary objects. However, achieving sufficient resolution is constrained by hardware capabilities and physical factors, leading to the development of processing techniques to enhance the resolution after acquisition. In this work, we leverage artificial intelligence to increase the Doppler resolution in range-Doppler maps. Based on a zero-padded FFT, a refinement via the generative neural networks of diffusion models is achieved. We demonstrate that our method overcomes the limitations of traditional FFT, generating data where closely spaced targets are effectively separated.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-video generation, particularly with autoregressive models, have enabled the synthesis of high-quality videos depicting individual scenes. However, extending these models to generate long, cross-scene videos remains a significant challenge. As the context length grows during autoregressive decoding, computational costs rise sharply, and the model's ability to maintain consistency and adhere to evolving textual prompts deteriorates. We introduce InfLVG, an inference-time framework that enables coherent long video generation without requiring additional long-form video data. InfLVG leverages a learnable context selection policy, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to dynamically identify and retain the most semantically relevant context throughout the generation process. Instead of accumulating the entire generation history, the policy ranks and selects the top-$K$ most contextually relevant tokens, allowing the model to maintain a fixed computational budget while preserving content consistency and prompt alignment. To optimize the policy, we design a hybrid reward function that jointly captures semantic alignment, cross-scene consistency, and artifact reduction. To benchmark performance, we introduce the Cross-scene Video Benchmark (CsVBench) along with an Event Prompt Set (EPS) that simulates complex multi-scene transitions involving shared subjects and varied actions/backgrounds. Experimental results show that InfLVG can extend video length by up to 9$\times$, achieving strong consistency and semantic fidelity across scenes.

- **Summary**: Restoring images degraded by adverse weather remains a significant challenge due to the highly non-uniform and spatially heterogeneous nature of weather-induced artifacts, e.g., fine-grained rain streaks versus widespread haze. Accurately estimating the underlying degradation can intuitively provide restoration models with more targeted and effective guidance, enabling adaptive processing strategies. To this end, we propose a Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism (MODEM) for adverse weather image restoration. Central to MODEM is the Morton-Order 2D-Selective-Scan Module (MOS2D), which integrates Morton-coded spatial ordering with selective state-space models to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local structural coherence. Complementing MOS2D, we introduce a Dual Degradation Estimation Module (DDEM) that disentangles and estimates both global and local degradation priors. These priors dynamically condition the MOS2D modules, facilitating adaptive and context-aware restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MODEM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks and weather types, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex degradation dynamics. Our code will be released at https://github.com/hainuo-wang/MODEM.git.

- **Summary**: With the growing adoption of autonomous driving, the advancement of sensor technology is crucial for ensuring safety and reliable operation. Sensor fusion techniques that combine multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and cameras have proven effective, but the integration of multiple devices increases both hardware complexity and cost. Therefore, developing a single sensor capable of performing multiple roles is highly desirable for cost-efficient and scalable autonomous driving systems.   Event cameras have emerged as a promising solution due to their unique characteristics, including high dynamic range, low latency, and high temporal resolution. These features enable them to perform well in challenging lighting conditions, such as low-light or backlit environments. Moreover, their ability to detect fine-grained motion events makes them suitable for applications like pedestrian detection and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication via visible light.   In this study, we present a method for distance estimation using a monocular event camera and a roadside LED bar. By applying a phase-only correlation technique to the event data, we achieve sub-pixel precision in detecting the spatial shift between two light sources. This enables accurate triangulation-based distance estimation without requiring stereo vision. Field experiments conducted in outdoor driving scenarios demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves over 90% success rate with less than 0.5-meter error for distances ranging from 20 to 60 meters.   Future work includes extending this method to full position estimation by leveraging infrastructure such as smart poles equipped with LEDs, enabling event-camera-based vehicles to determine their own position in real time. This advancement could significantly enhance navigation accuracy, route optimization, and integration into intelligent transportation systems.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D GANs based on 3D Gaussian splatting have been proposed for high quality synthesis of human heads. However, existing methods stabilize training and enhance rendering quality from steep viewpoints by conditioning the random latent vector on the current camera position. This compromises 3D consistency, as we observe significant identity changes when re-synthesizing the 3D head with each camera shift. Conversely, fixing the camera to a single viewpoint yields high-quality renderings for that perspective but results in poor performance for novel views. Removing view-conditioning typically destabilizes GAN training, often causing the training to collapse. In response to these challenges, we introduce CGS-GAN, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting GAN framework that enables stable training and high-quality 3D-consistent synthesis of human heads without relying on view-conditioning. To ensure training stability, we introduce a multi-view regularization technique that enhances generator convergence with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we adapt the conditional loss used in existing 3D Gaussian splatting GANs and propose a generator architecture designed to not only stabilize training but also facilitate efficient rendering and straightforward scaling, enabling output resolutions up to $2048^2$. To evaluate the capabilities of CGS-GAN, we curate a new dataset derived from FFHQ. This dataset enables very high resolutions, focuses on larger portions of the human head, reduces view-dependent artifacts for improved 3D consistency, and excludes images where subjects are obscured by hands or other objects. As a result, our approach achieves very high rendering quality, supported by competitive FID scores, while ensuring consistent 3D scene generation.

- **Summary**: In autonomous navigation systems, the solution of the place recognition problem is crucial for their safe functioning. But this is not a trivial solution, since it must be accurate regardless of any changes in the scene, such as seasonal changes and different weather conditions, and it must be generalizable to other environments. This paper presents our method, MinkUNeXt-SI, which, starting from a LiDAR point cloud, preprocesses the input data to obtain its spherical coordinates and intensity values normalized within a range of 0 to 1 for each point, and it produces a robust place recognition descriptor. To that end, a deep learning approach that combines Minkowski convolutions and a U-net architecture with skip connections is used. The results of MinkUNeXt-SI demonstrate that this method reaches and surpasses state-of-the-art performance while it also generalizes satisfactorily to other datasets. Additionally, we showcase the capture of a custom dataset and its use in evaluating our solution, which also achieves outstanding results. Both the code of our solution and the runs of our dataset are publicly available for reproducibility purposes.

- **Summary**: Automatically evaluating multimodal generation presents a significant challenge, as automated metrics often struggle to align reliably with human evaluation, especially for complex tasks that involve multiple modalities. To address this, we present MMMG, a comprehensive and human-aligned benchmark for multimodal generation across 4 modality combinations (image, audio, interleaved text and image, interleaved text and audio), with a focus on tasks that present significant challenges for generation models, while still enabling reliable automatic evaluation through a combination of models and programs. MMMG encompasses 49 tasks (including 29 newly developed ones), each with a carefully designed evaluation pipeline, and 937 instructions to systematically assess reasoning, controllability, and other key capabilities of multimodal generation models. Extensive validation demonstrates that MMMG is highly aligned with human evaluation, achieving an average agreement of 94.3%. Benchmarking results on 24 multimodal generation models reveal that even though the state-of-the-art model, GPT Image, achieves 78.3% accuracy for image generation, it falls short on multimodal reasoning and interleaved generation. Furthermore, results suggest considerable headroom for improvement in audio generation, highlighting an important direction for future research.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised pathology detection trains models on non-pathological data to flag deviations as pathologies, offering strong generalizability for identifying novel diseases and avoiding costly annotations. However, building reliable normality models requires vast healthy datasets, as hospitals' data is inherently biased toward symptomatic populations, while privacy regulations hinder the assembly of representative healthy cohorts. To address this limitation, we propose PathoSCOPE, a few-shot unsupervised pathology detection framework that requires only a small set of non-pathological samples (minimum 2 shots), significantly improving data efficiency. We introduce Global-Local Contrastive Loss (GLCL), comprised of a Local Contrastive Loss to reduce the variability of non-pathological embeddings and a Global Contrastive Loss to enhance the discrimination of pathological regions. We also propose a Pathology-informed Embedding Generation (PiEG) module that synthesizes pathological embeddings guided by the global loss, better exploiting the limited non-pathological samples. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 and ChestXray8 datasets, PathoSCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods while maintaining computational efficiency (2.48 GFLOPs, 166 FPS).

- **Summary**: As the marginal cost of scaling computation (data and parameters) during model pre-training continues to increase substantially, test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising direction for improving generative model performance by allocating additional computation at inference time. While TTS has demonstrated significant success across multiple language tasks, there remains a notable gap in understanding the test-time scaling behaviors of image and video generative models (diffusion-based or flow-based models). Although recent works have initiated exploration into inference-time strategies for vision tasks, these approaches face critical limitations: being constrained to task-specific domains, exhibiting poor scalability, or falling into reward over-optimization that sacrifices sample diversity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Evo}lutionary \textbf{Search} (EvoSearch), a novel, generalist, and efficient TTS method that effectively enhances the scalability of both image and video generation across diffusion and flow models, without requiring additional training or model expansion. EvoSearch reformulates test-time scaling for diffusion and flow models as an evolutionary search problem, leveraging principles from biological evolution to efficiently explore and refine the denoising trajectory. By incorporating carefully designed selection and mutation mechanisms tailored to the stochastic differential equation denoising process, EvoSearch iteratively generates higher-quality offspring while preserving population diversity. Through extensive evaluation across both diffusion and flow architectures for image and video generation tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieves higher diversity, and shows strong generalizability to unseen evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Synthetic X-ray angiographies generated by modern generative models hold great potential to reduce the use of contrast agents in vascular interventional procedures. However, low-quality synthetic angiographies can significantly increase procedural risk, underscoring the need for reliable image quality assessment (IQA) methods. Existing IQA models, however, fail to leverage auxiliary images as references during evaluation and lack fine-grained, task-specific metrics necessary for clinical relevance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes CAS-IQA, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework that predicts fine-grained quality scores by effectively incorporating auxiliary information from related images. In the absence of angiography datasets, CAS-3K is constructed, comprising 3,565 synthetic angiographies along with score annotations. To ensure clinically meaningful assessment, three task-specific evaluation metrics are defined. Furthermore, a Multi-path featUre fuSion and rouTing (MUST) module is designed to enhance image representations by adaptively fusing and routing visual tokens to metric-specific branches. Extensive experiments on the CAS-3K dataset demonstrate that CAS-IQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA methods by a considerable margin.

- **Summary**: With recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and growing interest in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the ability to understand table structures has become increasingly important. This is especially critical in financial domains such as securities reports, where highly accurate question answering (QA) over tables is required. However, tables exist in various formats-including HTML, images, and plain text-making it difficult to preserve and extract structural information. Therefore, multimodal LLMs are essential for robust and general-purpose table understanding. Despite their promise, current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are major representatives of multimodal LLMs, still face challenges in accurately understanding characters and their spatial relationships within documents. In this study, we propose a method to enhance LVLM-based table understanding by incorporating in-table textual content and layout features. Experimental results demonstrate that these auxiliary modalities significantly improve performance, enabling robust interpretation of complex document layouts without relying on explicitly structured input formats.

- **Summary**: Medical image reconstruction from measurement data is a vital but challenging inverse problem. Deep learning approaches have achieved promising results, but often requires paired measurement and high-quality images, which is typically simulated through a forward model, i.e., retrospective reconstruction. However, training on simulated pairs commonly leads to performance degradation on real prospective data due to the retrospective-to-prospective gap caused by incomplete imaging knowledge in simulation. To address this challenge, this paper introduces imaging Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport (KIDOT), a novel dynamic optimal transport framework with optimality in the sense of preserving consistency with imaging physics in transport, that conceptualizes reconstruction as finding a dynamic transport path. KIDOT learns from unpaired data by modeling reconstruction as a continuous evolution path from measurements to images, guided by an imaging knowledge-informed cost function and transport equation. This dynamic and knowledge-aware approach enhances robustness and better leverages unpaired data while respecting acquisition physics. Theoretically, we demonstrate that KIDOT naturally generalizes dynamic optimal transport, ensuring its mathematical rationale and solution existence. Extensive experiments on MRI and CT reconstruction demonstrate KIDOT's superior performance.

- **Summary**: Embodied agents operating in smart homes must understand human behavior through diverse sensory inputs and communicate via natural language. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled impressive language-grounded perception, their reliance on visual data limits robustness in real-world scenarios with occlusions, poor lighting, or privacy constraints. In this paper, we introduce HoloLLM, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates uncommon but powerful sensing modalities, such as LiDAR, infrared, mmWave radar, and WiFi, to enable seamless human perception and reasoning across heterogeneous environments. We address two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of aligned modality-text data for rare sensors, and (2) the heterogeneity of their physical signal representations. To overcome these, we design a Universal Modality-Injection Projector (UMIP) that enhances pre-aligned modality embeddings with fine-grained, text-aligned features from tailored encoders via coarse-to-fine cross-attention without introducing significant alignment overhead. We further introduce a human-VLM collaborative data curation pipeline to generate paired textual annotations for sensing datasets. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmarks show that HoloLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, improving language-grounded human sensing accuracy by up to 30%. This work establishes a new foundation for real-world, language-informed multisensory embodied intelligence.

- **Summary**: Images are often obstructed by various obstacles due to capture limitations, hindering the observation of objects of interest. Most existing methods address occlusions from specific elements like fences or raindrops, but are constrained by the wide range of real-world obstructions, making comprehensive data collection impractical. To overcome these challenges, we propose Instruct2See, a novel zero-shot framework capable of handling both seen and unseen obstacles. The core idea of our approach is to unify obstruction removal by treating it as a soft-hard mask restoration problem, where any obstruction can be represented using multi-modal prompts, such as visual semantics and textual instructions, processed through a cross-attention unit to enhance contextual understanding and improve mode control. Additionally, a tunable mask adapter allows for dynamic soft masking, enabling real-time adjustment of inaccurate masks. Extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution obstacles show that Instruct2See consistently achieves strong performance and generalization in obstruction removal, regardless of whether the obstacles were present during the training phase.

- **Summary**: Safe and feasible trajectory planning is essential for real-world autonomous driving systems. However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: High-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) image segmentation is challenging due to complex spatial layouts and diverse object appearances. While CNNs excel at capturing local features, they struggle with long-range dependencies, whereas Transformers can model global context but often neglect local details and are computationally expensive.We propose a novel approach, Region-Aware Proxy Network (RAPNet), which consists of two components: Contextual Region Attention (CRA) and Global Class Refinement (GCR). Unlike traditional methods that rely on grid-based layouts, RAPNet operates at the region level for more flexible segmentation. The CRA module uses a Transformer to capture region-level contextual dependencies, generating a Semantic Region Mask (SRM). The GCR module learns a global class attention map to refine multi-class information, combining the SRM and attention map for accurate segmentation.Experiments on three public datasets show that RAPNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior multi-class segmentation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based multi-view coarse-grained 3D shape classification has achieved remarkable success over the past decade, leveraging the powerful feature learning capabilities of CNN-based and ViT-based backbones. However, as a challenging research area critical for detailed shape understanding, fine-grained 3D classification remains understudied due to the limited discriminative information captured during multi-view feature aggregation, particularly for subtle inter-class variations, class imbalance, and inherent interpretability limitations of parametric model. To address these problems, we propose the first prototype-based framework named Proto-FG3D for fine-grained 3D shape classification, achieving a paradigm shift from parametric softmax to non-parametric prototype learning. Firstly, Proto-FG3D establishes joint multi-view and multi-category representation learning via Prototype Association. Secondly, prototypes are refined via Online Clustering, improving both the robustness of multi-view feature allocation and inter-subclass balance. Finally, prototype-guided supervised learning is established to enhance fine-grained discrimination via prototype-view correlation analysis and enables ad-hoc interpretability through transparent case-based reasoning. Experiments on FG3D and ModelNet40 show Proto-FG3D surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, transparent predictions, and ad-hoc interpretability with visualizations, challenging conventional fine-grained 3D recognition approaches.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way to extract 3D spatio-temporal features. However, existing SNNs still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to inadequate pre-training strategies. These limitations manifest as restricted generalization ability, task specificity, and a lack of multimodal understanding, particularly in challenging tasks such as multimodal question answering and zero-shot 3D classification. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Spike-based Vision-Language (SVL) pretraining framework that empowers SNNs with open-world 3D understanding while maintaining spike-driven efficiency. SVL introduces two key components: (i) Multi-scale Triple Alignment (MTA) for label-free triplet-based contrastive learning across 3D, image, and text modalities, and (ii) Re-parameterizable Vision-Language Integration (Rep-VLI) to enable lightweight inference without relying on large text encoders. Extensive experiments show that SVL achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.4% in zero-shot 3D classification, surpassing advanced ANN models, and consistently outperforms prior SNNs on downstream tasks, including 3D classification (+6.1%), DVS action recognition (+2.1%), 3D detection (+1.1%), and 3D segmentation (+2.1%) with remarkable efficiency. Moreover, SVL enables SNNs to perform open-world 3D question answering, sometimes outperforming ANNs. To the best of our knowledge, SVL represents the first scalable, generalizable, and hardware-friendly paradigm for 3D open-world understanding, effectively bridging the gap between SNNs and ANNs in complex open-world understanding tasks.

- **Summary**: Accurate 3D reconstruction of hands and instruments is critical for vision-based analysis of ophthalmic microsurgery, yet progress has been hampered by the lack of realistic, large-scale datasets and reliable annotation tools. In this work, we introduce OphNet-3D, the first extensive RGB-D dynamic 3D reconstruction dataset for ophthalmic surgery, comprising 41 sequences from 40 surgeons and totaling 7.1 million frames, with fine-grained annotations of 12 surgical phases, 10 instrument categories, dense MANO hand meshes, and full 6-DoF instrument poses. To scalably produce high-fidelity labels, we design a multi-stage automatic annotation pipeline that integrates multi-view data observation, data-driven motion prior with cross-view geometric consistency and biomechanical constraints, along with a combination of collision-aware interaction constraints for instrument interactions. Building upon OphNet-3D, we establish two challenging benchmarks-bimanual hand pose estimation and hand-instrument interaction reconstruction-and propose two dedicated architectures: H-Net for dual-hand mesh recovery and OH-Net for joint reconstruction of two-hand-two-instrument interactions. These models leverage a novel spatial reasoning module with weak-perspective camera modeling and collision-aware center-based representation. Both architectures outperform existing methods by substantial margins, achieving improvements of over 2mm in Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and up to 23% in ADD-S metrics for hand and instrument reconstruction, respectively.

- **Summary**: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe neurological complication among premature infants, necessitating early and accurate detection from brain ultrasound (US) images to improve clinical outcomes. While recent deep learning methods offer promise for computer-aided diagnosis, challenges remain in capturing both local spatial details and global contextual dependencies critical for segmenting brain anatomies. In this work, we propose an enhanced Residual U-Net architecture incorporating two complementary attention mechanisms: the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a Sparse Attention Layer (SAL). The CBAM improves the model's ability to refine spatial and channel-wise features, while the SAL introduces a dual-branch design, sparse attention filters out low-confidence query-key pairs to suppress noise, and dense attention ensures comprehensive information propagation. Extensive experiments on the Brain US dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with a Dice score of 89.04% and IoU of 81.84% for ventricle region segmentation. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating spatial refinement and attention sparsity for robust brain anatomy detection.

- **Summary**: Indoor positioning based on 5G data has achieved high accuracy through the adoption of recent machine learning (ML) techniques. However, the performance of learning-based methods degrades significantly when environmental conditions change, thereby hindering their applicability to new scenarios. Acquiring new training data for each environmental change and fine-tuning ML models is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. This paper introduces a domain incremental learning (DIL) approach for dynamic 5G indoor localization, called 5G-DIL, enabling rapid adaptation to environmental changes. We present a novel similarity-aware sampling technique based on the Chebyshev distance, designed to efficiently select specific exemplars from the previous environment while training only on the modified regions of the new environment. This avoids the need to train on the entire region, significantly reducing the time and resources required for adaptation without compromising localization accuracy. This approach requires as few as 50 exemplars from adaptation domains, significantly reducing training time while maintaining high positioning accuracy in previous environments. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art DIL techniques on a challenging real-world indoor dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sample selection method. Our approach is adaptable to real-world non-line-of-sight propagation scenarios and achieves an MAE positioning error of 0.261 meters, even under dynamic environmental conditions.

- **Summary**: Visual language models (VLMs) have attracted increasing interest in autonomous driving due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states: where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.

- **Summary**: Traditional supervised medical image segmentation models require large amounts of labeled data for training; however, obtaining such large-scale labeled datasets in the real world is extremely challenging. Recent semi-supervised segmentation models also suffer from noisy pseudo-label issue and limited supervision in feature space. To solve these challenges, we propose an innovative semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation method to reduce the dependency on large, expert-labeled datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-network architecture to address the limitations of existing methods in using contextual information and generating reliable pseudo-labels. In addition, a self-supervised contrastive learning strategy is used to enhance the representation of the network and reduce prediction uncertainty by distinguishing between reliable and unreliable predictions. Experiments on clinical magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at https://github.com/AIPMLab/Semi-supervised-Segmentation.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to detect anomalies without any target domain training samples, relying solely on external auxiliary data. Existing CLIP-based methods attempt to activate the model's ZSAD potential via handcrafted or static learnable prompts. The former incur high engineering costs and limited semantic coverage, whereas the latter apply identical descriptions across diverse anomaly types, thus fail to adapt to complex variations. Furthermore, since CLIP is originally pretrained on large-scale classification tasks, its anomaly segmentation quality is highly sensitive to the exact wording of class names, severely constraining prompting strategies that depend on class labels. To address these challenges, we introduce ViP$^{2}$-CLIP. The key insight of ViP$^{2}$-CLIP is a Visual-Perception Prompting (ViP-Prompt) mechanism, which fuses global and multi-scale local visual context to adaptively generate fine-grained textual prompts, eliminating manual templates and class-name priors. This design enables our model to focus on precise abnormal regions, making it particularly valuable when category labels are ambiguous or privacy-constrained. Extensive experiments on 15 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that ViP$^{2}$-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust cross-domain generalization.

- **Summary**: Despite the advances in Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) benchmarks, their evaluation protocols remain constrained, primarily focusing on either single targets with short queries (containing minimal attributes) or multiple targets from distinctly different queries on a single domain. This limitation significantly hinders the assessment of more complex reasoning capabilities in RES models. We introduce WildRES, a novel benchmark that incorporates long queries with diverse attributes and non-distinctive queries for multiple targets. This benchmark spans diverse application domains, including autonomous driving environments and robotic manipulation scenarios, thus enabling more rigorous evaluation of complex reasoning capabilities in real-world settings. Our analysis reveals that current RES models demonstrate substantial performance deterioration when evaluated on WildRES. To address this challenge, we introduce SynRES, an automated pipeline generating densely paired compositional synthetic training data through three innovations: (1) a dense caption-driven synthesis for attribute-rich image-mask-expression triplets, (2) reliable semantic alignment mechanisms rectifying caption-pseudo mask inconsistencies via Image-Text Aligned Grouping, and (3) domain-aware augmentations incorporating mosaic composition and superclass replacement to emphasize generalization ability and distinguishing attributes over object categories. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with SynRES achieve state-of-the-art performance, improving gIoU by 2.0% on WildRES-ID and 3.8% on WildRES-DS.

- **Summary**: The advent of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling will significantly transform the design of industrial products. The recent research endeavor has extended into the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). In contrast to fine-tuning methods, training-free approaches typically utilize the advanced closed-source LLMs, thereby offering enhanced flexibility and efficiency in the development of AI agents for generating CAD parametric models. However, the substantial cost and limitations of local deployment of the top-tier closed-source LLMs pose challenges in practical applications. The Seek-CAD is the pioneer exploration of locally deployed open-source inference LLM DeepSeek-R1 for CAD parametric model generation with a training-free methodology. This study is the first investigation to incorporate both visual and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) feedback within the self-refinement mechanism for generating CAD models. Specifically, the initial generated parametric CAD model is rendered into a sequence of step-wise perspective images, which are subsequently processed by a Vision Language Model (VLM) alongside the corresponding CoTs derived from DeepSeek-R1 to assess the CAD model generation. Then, the feedback is utilized by DeepSeek-R1 to refine the initial generated model for the next round of generation. Moreover, we present an innovative 3D CAD model dataset structured around the SSR (Sketch, Sketch-based feature, and Refinements) triple design paradigm. This dataset encompasses a wide range of CAD commands, thereby aligning effectively with industrial application requirements and proving suitable for the generation of LLMs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Seek-CAD under various metrics.

- **Summary**: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have achieved significant success in point cloud generation, enabling numerous downstream applications, such as generative data augmentation and 3D model editing. However, little attention has been given to generating point clouds with point-wise segmentation labels, as well as to developing evaluation metrics for this task. Therefore, in this paper, we present SeaLion, a novel diffusion model designed to generate high-quality and diverse point clouds with fine-grained segmentation labels. Specifically, we introduce the semantic part-aware latent point diffusion technique, which leverages the intermediate features of the generative models to jointly predict the noise for perturbed latent points and associated part segmentation labels during the denoising process, and subsequently decodes the latent points to point clouds conditioned on part segmentation labels. To effectively evaluate the quality of generated point clouds, we introduce a novel point cloud pairwise distance calculation method named part-aware Chamfer distance (p-CD). This method enables existing metrics, such as 1-NNA, to measure both the local structural quality and inter-part coherence of generated point clouds. Experiments on the large-scale synthetic dataset ShapeNet and real-world medical dataset IntrA demonstrate that SeaLion achieves remarkable performance in generation quality and diversity, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art model, DiffFacto, by 13.33% and 6.52% on 1-NNA (p-CD) across the two datasets. Experimental analysis shows that SeaLion can be trained semi-supervised, thereby reducing the demand for labeling efforts. Lastly, we validate the applicability of SeaLion in generative data augmentation for training segmentation models and the capability of SeaLion to serve as a tool for part-aware 3D shape editing.

In particular, vision-language MLLMs have been developed to generate not only text but also visual outputs from multimodal inputs. This advancement requires efficient image tokens that LLMs can process effectively both in input and output. However, existing image tokenization methods for MLLMs typically capture only global abstract concepts or uniformly segmented image patches, restricting MLLMs' capability to effectively understand or generate detailed visual content, particularly at the object level. To address this limitation, we propose an object-centric visual tokenizer based on Slot Attention specifically for MLLMs. In particular, based on the Q-Former encoder, diffusion decoder, and residual vector quantization, our proposed discretized slot tokens can encode local visual details while maintaining high-level semantics, and also align with textual data to be integrated seamlessly within a unified next-token prediction framework of LLMs. The resulting Slot-MLLM demonstrates significant performance improvements over baselines with previous visual tokenizers across various vision-language tasks that entail local detailed comprehension and generation. Notably, this work is the first demonstration of the feasibility of object-centric slot attention performed with MLLMs and in-the-wild natural images.

- **Summary**: Safety-critical scenarios are rare yet pivotal for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of autonomous driving systems. While existing methods generate safety-critical driving trajectories, simulations, or single-view videos, they fall short of meeting the demands of advanced end-to-end autonomous systems (E2E AD), which require real-world, multi-view video data. To bridge this gap, we introduce SafeMVDrive, the first framework designed to generate high-quality, safety-critical, multi-view driving videos grounded in real-world domains. SafeMVDrive strategically integrates a safety-critical trajectory generator with an advanced multi-view video generator. To tackle the challenges inherent in this integration, we first enhance scene understanding ability of the trajectory generator by incorporating visual context -- which is previously unavailable to such generator -- and leveraging a GRPO-finetuned vision-language model to achieve more realistic and context-aware trajectory generation. Second, recognizing that existing multi-view video generators struggle to render realistic collision events, we introduce a two-stage, controllable trajectory generation mechanism that produces collision-evasion trajectories, ensuring both video quality and safety-critical fidelity. Finally, we employ a diffusion-based multi-view video generator to synthesize high-quality safety-critical driving videos from the generated trajectories. Experiments conducted on an E2E AD planner demonstrate a significant increase in collision rate when tested with our generated data, validating the effectiveness of SafeMVDrive in stress-testing planning modules.

- **Summary**: Accurate, fast, and reliable 3D perception is essential for autonomous driving. Recently, bird's-eye view (BEV)-based perception approaches have emerged as superior alternatives to perspective-based solutions, offering enhanced spatial understanding and more natural outputs for planning. Existing BEV-based 3D object detection methods, typically adhering to angle-based representation, directly estimate the size and orientation of rotated bounding boxes. We observe that BEV-based 3D object detection is analogous to aerial oriented object detection, where angle-based methods are recognized for being affected by discontinuities in their loss functions. Drawing inspiration from this domain, we propose Restricted Quadrilateral Representation to define 3D regression targets. RQR3D regresses the smallest horizontal bounding box encapsulating the oriented box, along with the offsets between the corners of these two boxes, thereby transforming the oriented object detection problem into a keypoint regression task. RQR3D is compatible with any 3D object detection approach. We employ RQR3D within an anchor-free single-stage object detection method and introduce an objectness head to address class imbalance problem. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified radar fusion backbone that eliminates the need for voxel grouping and processes the BEV-mapped point cloud with standard 2D convolutions, rather than sparse convolutions. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that RQR3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera-radar 3D object detection, outperforming the previous best method by +4% in NDS and +2.4% in mAP, and significantly reducing the translation and orientation errors, which are crucial for safe autonomous driving. These consistent gains highlight the robustness, precision, and real-world readiness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for high-stakes applications like medicine, often surpassing human performance. However, most explanation methods rely on post-hoc attribution, approximating the decision-making process of already trained black-box models. These methods are often sensitive, unreliable, and fail to reflect true model reasoning, limiting their trustworthiness in critical applications. In this work, we introduce SoftCAM, a straightforward yet effective approach that makes standard CNN architectures inherently interpretable. By removing the global average pooling layer and replacing the fully connected classification layer with a convolution-based class evidence layer, SoftCAM preserves spatial information and produces explicit class activation maps that form the basis of the model's predictions. Evaluated on three medical datasets, SoftCAM maintains classification performance while significantly improving both the qualitative and quantitative explanation compared to existing post-hoc methods. Our results demonstrate that CNNs can be inherently interpretable without compromising performance, advancing the development of self-explainable deep learning for high-stakes decision-making.

- **Summary**: While recent advances in image editing have enabled impressive visual synthesis capabilities, current methods remain constrained by explicit textual instructions and limited editing operations, lacking deep comprehension of implicit user intentions and contextual reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new image editing paradigm: reasoning-guided generative editing, which synthesizes images based on complex, multi-faceted textual queries accepting world knowledge and intention inference. To facilitate this task, we first construct a comprehensive dataset featuring over 1,000 image-instruction-edit triples that incorporate rich reasoning contexts and real-world knowledge. We then propose R-Genie: a reasoning-guided generative image editor, which synergizes the generation power of diffusion models with advanced reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models. R-Genie incorporates a reasoning-attention mechanism to bridge linguistic understanding with visual synthesis, enabling it to handle intricate editing requests involving abstract user intentions and contextual reasoning relations. Extensive experimental results validate that R-Genie can equip diffusion models with advanced reasoning-based editing capabilities, unlocking new potentials for intelligent image synthesis.

- **Summary**: Topology reasoning, which unifies perception and structured reasoning, plays a vital role in understanding intersections for autonomous driving. However, its performance heavily relies on the accuracy of lane detection, particularly at connected lane endpoints. Existing methods often suffer from lane endpoints deviation, leading to incorrect topology construction. To address this issue, we propose TopoPoint, a novel framework that explicitly detects lane endpoints and jointly reasons over endpoints and lanes for robust topology reasoning. During training, we independently initialize point and lane query, and proposed Point-Lane Merge Self-Attention to enhance global context sharing through incorporating geometric distances between points and lanes as an attention mask . We further design Point-Lane Graph Convolutional Network to enable mutual feature aggregation between point and lane query. During inference, we introduce Point-Lane Geometry Matching algorithm that computes distances between detected points and lanes to refine lane endpoints, effectively mitigating endpoint deviation. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that TopoPoint achieves state-of-the-art performance in topology reasoning (48.8 on OLS). Additionally, we propose DET$_p$ to evaluate endpoint detection, under which our method significantly outperforms existing approaches (52.6 v.s. 45.2 on DET$_p$). The code is released at https://github.com/Franpin/TopoPoint.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based scene text synthesis has progressed rapidly, yet existing methods commonly rely on additional visual conditioning modules and require large-scale annotated data to support multilingual generation. In this work, we revisit the necessity of complex auxiliary modules and further explore an approach that simultaneously ensures glyph accuracy and achieves high-fidelity scene integration, by leveraging diffusion models' inherent capabilities for contextual reasoning. To this end, we introduce TextFlux, a DiT-based framework that enables multilingual scene text synthesis. The advantages of TextFlux can be summarized as follows: (1) OCR-free model architecture. TextFlux eliminates the need for OCR encoders (additional visual conditioning modules) that are specifically used to extract visual text-related features. (2) Strong multilingual scalability. TextFlux is effective in low-resource multilingual settings, and achieves strong performance in newly added languages with fewer than 1,000 samples. (3) Streamlined training setup. TextFlux is trained with only 1% of the training data required by competing methods. (4) Controllable multi-line text generation. TextFlux offers flexible multi-line synthesis with precise line-level control, outperforming methods restricted to single-line or rigid layouts. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that TextFlux outperforms previous methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound is a widely-used imaging modality critical to global healthcare, yet its interpretation remains challenging due to its varying image quality on operators, noises, and anatomical structures. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities across natural and medical domains, their performance on ultrasound remains largely unexplored. We introduce U2-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LVLMs on ultrasound understanding across classification, detection, regression, and text generation tasks. U2-BENCH aggregates 7,241 cases spanning 15 anatomical regions and defines 8 clinically inspired tasks, such as diagnosis, view recognition, lesion localization, clinical value estimation, and report generation, across 50 ultrasound application scenarios. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art LVLMs, both open- and closed-source, general-purpose and medical-specific. Our results reveal strong performance on image-level classification, but persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and clinical language generation. U2-BENCH establishes a rigorous and unified testbed to assess and accelerate LVLM research in the uniquely multimodal domain of medical ultrasound imaging.

- **Summary**: Ground deformation is regarded in volcanology as a key precursor signal preceding volcanic eruptions. Satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) enables consistent, global-scale deformation tracking; however, deep learning methods remain largely unexplored in this domain, mainly due to the lack of a curated machine learning dataset. In this work, we build on the existing Hephaestus dataset, and introduce Hephaestus Minicubes, a global collection of 38 spatiotemporal datacubes offering high resolution, multi-source and multi-temporal information, covering 44 of the world's most active volcanoes over a 7-year period. Each spatiotemporal datacube integrates InSAR products, topographic data, as well as atmospheric variables which are known to introduce signal delays that can mimic ground deformation in InSAR imagery. Furthermore, we provide expert annotations detailing the type, intensity and spatial extent of deformation events, along with rich text descriptions of the observed scenes. Finally, we present a comprehensive benchmark, demonstrating Hephaestus Minicubes' ability to support volcanic unrest monitoring as a multi-modal, multi-temporal classification and semantic segmentation task, establishing strong baselines with state-of-the-art architectures. This work aims to advance machine learning research in volcanic monitoring, contributing to the growing integration of data-driven methods within Earth science applications.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation is widely used to train deep learning models to address data scarcity. However, traditional data augmentation (TDA) typically relies on simple geometric transformation, such as random rotation and rescaling, resulting in minimal data diversity enrichment and limited model performance improvement. State-of-the-art generative models for 3D shape generation rely on the denoising diffusion probabilistic models and manage to generate realistic novel point clouds for 3D content creation and manipulation. Nevertheless, the generated 3D shapes lack associated point-wise semantic labels, restricting their usage in enlarging the training data for point cloud segmentation tasks. To bridge the gap between data augmentation techniques and the advanced diffusion models, we extend the state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model, Lion, to a part-aware generative model that can generate high-quality point clouds conditioned on given segmentation masks. Leveraging the novel generative model, we introduce a 3-step generative data augmentation (GDA) pipeline for point cloud segmentation training. Our GDA approach requires only a small amount of labeled samples but enriches the training data with generated variants and pseudo-labeled samples, which are validated by a novel diffusion-based pseudo-label filtering method. Extensive experiments on two large-scale synthetic datasets and a real-world medical dataset demonstrate that our GDA method outperforms TDA approach and related semi-supervised and self-supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images from a gallery based on a reference image and modification text as a combined query. Recent approaches focus on balancing global information from two modalities and encode the query into a unified feature for retrieval. However, due to insufficient attention to fine-grained details, these coarse fusion methods often struggle with handling subtle visual alterations or intricate textual instructions. In this work, we propose DetailFusion, a novel dual-branch framework that effectively coordinates information across global and detailed granularities, thereby enabling detail-enhanced CIR. Our approach leverages atomic detail variation priors derived from an image editing dataset, supplemented by a detail-oriented optimization strategy to develop a Detail-oriented Inference Branch. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Feature Compositor that dynamically fuses global and detailed features based on fine-grained information of each unique multimodal query. Extensive experiments and ablation analyses not only demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CIRR and FashionIQ datasets but also validate the effectiveness and cross-domain adaptability of detail enhancement for CIR.

- **Summary**: Coreset selection targets the challenge of finding a small, representative subset of a large dataset that preserves essential patterns for effective machine learning. Although several surveys have examined data reduction strategies before, most focus narrowly on either classical geometry-based methods or active learning techniques. In contrast, this survey presents a more comprehensive view by unifying three major lines of coreset research, namely, training-free, training-oriented, and label-free approaches, into a single taxonomy. We present subfields often overlooked by existing work, including submodular formulations, bilevel optimization, and recent progress in pseudo-labeling for unlabeled datasets. Additionally, we examine how pruning strategies influence generalization and neural scaling laws, offering new insights that are absent from prior reviews. Finally, we compare these methods under varying computational, robustness, and performance demands and highlight open challenges, such as robustness, outlier filtering, and adapting coreset selection to foundation models, for future research.



### Temporal Consistency Constrained Transferable Adversarial Attacks with Background Mixup for Action Recognition

- **Summary**: Action recognition models using deep learning are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are transferable across other models trained on the same data modality. Existing transferable attack methods face two major challenges: 1) they heavily rely on the assumption that the decision boundaries of the surrogate (a.k.a., source) model and the target model are similar, which limits the adversarial transferability; and 2) their decision boundary difference makes the attack direction uncertain, which may result in the gradient oscillation, weakening the adversarial attack. This motivates us to propose a Background Mixup-induced Temporal Consistency (BMTC) attack method for action recognition. From the input transformation perspective, we design a model-agnostic background adversarial mixup module to reduce the surrogate-target model dependency. In particular, we randomly sample one video from each category and make its background frame, while selecting the background frame with the top attack ability for mixup with the clean frame by reinforcement learning. Moreover, to ensure an explicit attack direction, we leverage the background category as guidance for updating the gradient of adversarial example, and design a temporal gradient consistency loss, which strengthens the stability of the attack direction on subsequent frames. Empirical studies on two video datasets, i.e., UCF101 and Kinetics-400, and one image dataset, i.e., ImageNet, demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the transferability of adversarial examples across several action/image recognition models. Our code is available at https://github.com/mlvccn/BMTC_TransferAttackVid.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success but continue to struggle with object hallucination (OH), generating outputs inconsistent with visual inputs. While previous work has proposed methods to reduce OH, the visual decision-making mechanisms that lead to hallucinations remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose VaLSe, a Vision-aware Latent Steering framework that adopts an interpretation-then-mitigation strategy to address OH in LVLMs. By tackling dual challenges of modeling complex vision-language interactions and eliminating spurious activation artifacts, VaLSe can generate visual contribution maps that trace how specific visual inputs influence individual output tokens. These maps reveal the model's vision-aware focus regions, which are then used to perform latent space steering, realigning internal representations toward semantically relevant content and reducing hallucinated outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaLSe is a powerful interpretability tool and an effective method for enhancing model robustness against OH across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers limitations in existing OH evaluation metrics, underscoring the need for more nuanced, interpretable, and visually grounded OH benchmarks in future work.

- **Summary**: Multi-spectral object re-identification (ReID) brings a new perception perspective for smart city and intelligent transportation applications, effectively addressing challenges from complex illumination and adverse weather. However, complex modal differences between heterogeneous spectra pose challenges to efficiently utilizing complementary and discrepancy of spectra information. Most existing methods fuse spectral data through intricate modal interaction modules, lacking fine-grained semantic understanding of spectral information (\textit{e.g.}, text descriptions, part masks, and object keypoints). To solve this challenge, we propose a novel Identity-Conditional text Prompt Learning framework (ICPL), which exploits the powerful cross-modal alignment capability of CLIP, to unify different spectral visual features from text semantics. Specifically, we first propose the online prompt learning using learnable text prompt as the identity-level semantic center to bridge the identity semantics of different spectra in online manner. Then, in lack of concrete text descriptions, we propose the multi-spectral identity-condition module to use identity prototype as spectral identity condition to constraint prompt learning. Meanwhile, we construct the alignment loop mutually optimizing the learnable text prompt and spectral visual encoder to avoid online prompt learning disrupting the pre-trained text-image alignment distribution. In addition, to adapt to small-scale multi-spectral data and mitigate style differences between spectra, we propose multi-spectral adapter that employs a low-rank adaption method to learn spectra-specific features. Comprehensive experiments on 5 benchmarks, including RGBNT201, Market-MM, MSVR310, RGBN300, and RGBNT100, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The task of grading atopic dermatitis (or AD, a form of eczema) from patient images is difficult even for trained dermatologists. Research on automating this task has progressed in recent years with the development of deep learning solutions; however, the rapid evolution of multimodal models and more specifically vision-language models (VLMs) opens the door to new possibilities in terms of explainable assessment of medical images, including dermatology. This report describes experiments carried out to evaluate the ability of seven VLMs to assess the severity of AD on a set of test images.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning is a representational learning paradigm in which a neural network maps data elements to feature vectors. It improves the feature space by forming lots with an anchor and examples that are either positive or negative based on class similarity. Hard negative examples, which are close to the anchor in the feature space but from a different class, improve learning performance. Finding such examples of high quality efficiently in large, high-dimensional datasets is computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose a GPU-friendly Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) scheme that quantizes real-valued feature vectors into binary representations for approximate nearest neighbor search. We investigate its theoretical properties and evaluate it on several datasets from textual and visual domain. Our approach achieves comparable or better performance while requiring significantly less computation than existing hard negative mining strategies.

- **Summary**: Generating realistic human motion with high-level controls is a crucial task for social understanding, robotics, and animation. With high-quality MOCAP data becoming more available recently, a wide range of data-driven approaches have been presented. However, modelling multi-person interactions still remains a less explored area. In this paper, we present Graph-driven Interaction Sampling, a method that can generate realistic and diverse multi-person interactions by leveraging existing two-person motion diffusion models as motion priors. Instead of training a new model specific to multi-person interaction synthesis, our key insight is to spatially and temporally separate complex multi-person interactions into a graph structure of two-person interactions, which we name the Pairwise Interaction Graph. We thus decompose the generation task into simultaneous single-person motion generation conditioned on one other's motion. In addition, to reduce artifacts such as interpenetrations of body parts in generated multi-person interactions, we introduce two graph-dependent guidance terms into the diffusion sampling scheme. Unlike previous work, our method can produce various high-quality multi-person interactions without having repetitive individual motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in reducing artifacts when generating a wide range of two-person and multi-person interactions.

- **Summary**: In practical applications, computer vision tasks often need to be addressed simultaneously. Multitask learning typically achieves this by jointly training a single deep neural network to learn shared representations, providing efficiency and improving generalization. Although action and gesture recognition are closely related tasks, since they focus on body and hand movements, current state-of-the-art methods handle them separately. In this paper, we show that employing a multi-task learning paradigm for action and gesture recognition results in more efficient, robust and generalizable visual representations, by leveraging the synergies between these tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple action and gesture datasets demonstrate that handling actions and gestures in a single architecture can achieve better performance for both tasks in comparison to their single-task learning variants.

- **Summary**: In recent years, tensor decomposition-based approaches for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) have gained significant attention in the field of remote sensing. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage both the global correlations and local smoothness of the background components in hyperspectral images (HSIs), which exist in both the spectral and spatial domains. This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To mitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named HAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR) factors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first decomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then employed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background component. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex regularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to simultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR factors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables the interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and smoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we design a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group sparsity of the anomaly component. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex model, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of detection accuracy.

- **Summary**: Concepts such as objects, patterns, and shapes are how humans understand the world. Building on this intuition, concept-based explainability methods aim to study representations learned by deep neural networks in relation to human-understandable concepts. Here, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are an important tool and can identify whether a model learned a concept or not. However, the computational cost and time requirements of existing CAV computation pose a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale, high-dimensional architectures. To address this limitation, we introduce FastCAV, a novel approach that accelerates the extraction of CAVs by up to 63.6x (on average 46.4x). We provide a theoretical foundation for our approach and give concrete assumptions under which it is equivalent to established SVM-based methods. Our empirical results demonstrate that CAVs calculated with FastCAV maintain similar performance while being more efficient and stable. In downstream applications, i.e., concept-based explanation methods, we show that FastCAV can act as a replacement leading to equivalent insights. Hence, our approach enables previously infeasible investigations of deep models, which we demonstrate by tracking the evolution of concepts during model training.

- **Summary**: Purpose: To evaluate the impact of harmonization and multi-region CT image feature integration on survival prediction in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, using handcrafted radiomics, pretrained foundation model (FM) features, and clinical data from a multicenter dataset.   Methods: We analyzed CT scans and clinical data from 876 NSCLC patients (604 training, 272 test) across five centers. Features were extracted from the whole lung, tumor, mediastinal nodes, coronary arteries, and coronary artery calcium (CAC). Handcrafted radiomics and FM deep features were harmonized using ComBat, reconstruction kernel normalization (RKN), and RKN+ComBat. Regularized Cox models predicted overall survival; performance was assessed using the concordance index (C-index), 5-year time-dependent area under the curve (t-AUC), and hazard ratio (HR). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values explained feature contributions. A consensus model used agreement across top region of interest (ROI) models to stratify patient risk.   Results: TNM staging showed prognostic utility (C-index = 0.67; HR = 2.70; t-AUC = 0.85). The clinical + tumor radiomics model with ComBat achieved a C-index of 0.7552 and t-AUC of 0.8820. FM features (50-voxel cubes) combined with clinical data yielded the highest performance (C-index = 0.7616; t-AUC = 0.8866). An ensemble of all ROIs and FM features reached a C-index of 0.7142 and t-AUC of 0.7885. The consensus model, covering 78% of valid test cases, achieved a t-AUC of 0.92, sensitivity of 97.6%, and specificity of 66.7%.   Conclusion: Harmonization and multi-region feature integration improve survival prediction in multicenter NSCLC data. Combining interpretable radiomics, FM features, and consensus modeling enables robust risk stratification across imaging centers.

- **Summary**: In real-world scenarios, pixel-level labeling is not always available. Sometimes, we need a semantic segmentation network, and even a visual encoder can have a high compatibility, and can be trained using various types of feedback beyond traditional labels, such as feedback that indicates the quality of the parsing results. To tackle this issue, we proposed RSS (Reward in Semantic Segmentation), the first practical application of reward-based reinforcement learning on pure semantic segmentation offered in two granular levels (pixel-level and image-level). RSS incorporates various novel technologies, such as progressive scale rewards (PSR) and pair-wise spatial difference (PSD), to ensure that the reward facilitates the convergence of the semantic segmentation network, especially under image-level rewards. Experiments and visualizations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed RSS can successfully ensure the convergence of the semantic segmentation network on two levels of rewards. Additionally, the RSS, which utilizes an image-level reward, outperforms existing weakly supervised methods that also rely solely on image-level signals during training.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of generative models, general-purpose generation has gained increasing attention as a promising approach to unify diverse tasks across modalities within a single system. Despite this progress, existing open-source frameworks often remain fragile and struggle to support complex real-world applications due to the lack of structured workflow planning and execution-level feedback. To address these limitations, we present ComfyMind, a collaborative AI system designed to enable robust and scalable general-purpose generation, built on the ComfyUI platform. ComfyMind introduces two core innovations: Semantic Workflow Interface (SWI) that abstracts low-level node graphs into callable functional modules described in natural language, enabling high-level composition and reducing structural errors; Search Tree Planning mechanism with localized feedback execution, which models generation as a hierarchical decision process and allows adaptive correction at each stage. Together, these components improve the stability and flexibility of complex generative workflows. We evaluate ComfyMind on three public benchmarks: ComfyBench, GenEval, and Reason-Edit, which span generation, editing, and reasoning tasks. Results show that ComfyMind consistently outperforms existing open-source baselines and achieves performance comparable to GPT-Image-1. ComfyMind paves a promising path for the development of open-source general-purpose generative AI systems. Project page: https://github.com/LitaoGuo/ComfyMind

- **Summary**: Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL) has recently shown great potential in aligning model outputs with human preferences across various generative tasks. In this work, we introduce a ReFL framework, named DiffusionReward, to the Blind Face Restoration task for the first time. DiffusionReward effectively overcomes the limitations of diffusion-based methods, which often fail to generate realistic facial details and exhibit poor identity consistency. The core of our framework is the Face Reward Model (FRM), which is trained using carefully annotated data. It provides feedback signals that play a pivotal role in steering the optimization process of the restoration network. In particular, our ReFL framework incorporates a gradient flow into the denoising process of off-the-shelf face restoration methods to guide the update of model parameters. The guiding gradient is collaboratively determined by three aspects: (i) the FRM to ensure the perceptual quality of the restored faces; (ii) a regularization term that functions as a safeguard to preserve generative diversity; and (iii) a structural consistency constraint to maintain facial fidelity. Furthermore, the FRM undergoes dynamic optimization throughout the process. It not only ensures that the restoration network stays precisely aligned with the real face manifold, but also effectively prevents reward hacking. Experiments on synthetic and wild datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving identity consistency and facial details.

- **Summary**: Cross-view geo-localization determines the location of a query image, captured by a drone or ground-based camera, by matching it to a geo-referenced satellite image. While traditional approaches focus on image-level localization, many applications, such as search-and-rescue, infrastructure inspection, and precision delivery, demand object-level accuracy. This enables users to prompt a specific object with a single click on a drone image to retrieve precise geo-tagged information of the object. However, variations in viewpoints, timing, and imaging conditions pose significant challenges, especially when identifying visually similar objects in extensive satellite imagery. To address these challenges, we propose an Object-level Cross-view Geo-localization Network (OCGNet). It integrates user-specified click locations using Gaussian Kernel Transfer (GKT) to preserve location information throughout the network. This cue is dually embedded into the feature encoder and feature matching blocks, ensuring robust object-specific localization. Additionally, OCGNet incorporates a Location Enhancement (LE) module and a Multi-Head Cross Attention (MHCA) module to adaptively emphasize object-specific features or expand focus to relevant contextual regions when necessary. OCGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset, CVOGL. It also demonstrates few-shot learning capabilities, effectively generalizing from limited examples, making it suitable for diverse applications (https://github.com/ZheyangH/OCGNet).

- **Summary**: Background: Bone surface reconstruction plays a critical role in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. Compared to traditional imaging modalities such as CT and MRI, ultrasound offers a radiation-free, cost-effective, and portable alternative. Continuous bone surface reconstruction can be employed for many clinical applications. However, due to the inherent limitations of ultrasound imaging, B-mode ultrasound typically capture only partial bone surfaces. Existing reconstruction methods struggle with such incomplete data, leading to artifacts and increased reconstruction errors. Effective techniques for accurately reconstructing thin and open bone surfaces from real-world 3D ultrasound volumes remain lacking. Methods: We propose UltraBoneUDF, a self-supervised framework designed for reconstructing open bone surfaces from ultrasound using neural Unsigned Distance Functions. To enhance reconstruction quality, we introduce a novel global feature extractor that effectively fuses ultrasound-specific image characteristics. Additionally, we present a novel loss function based on local tangent plane optimization that substantially improves surface reconstruction quality. UltraBoneUDF and baseline models are extensively evaluated on four open-source datasets. Results: Qualitative results highlight the limitations of the state-of-the-art methods for open bone surface reconstruction and demonstrate the effectiveness of UltraBoneUDF. Quantitatively, UltraBoneUDF significantly outperforms competing methods across all evaluated datasets for both open and closed bone surface reconstruction in terms of mean Chamfer distance error: 1.10 mm on the UltraBones100k dataset (39.6\% improvement compared to the SOTA), 0.23 mm on the OpenBoneCT dataset (69.3\% improvement), 0.18 mm on the ClosedBoneCT dataset (70.2\% improvement), and 0.05 mm on the Prostate dataset (55.3\% improvement).

- **Summary**: Automated segmentation of cancer on medical images can aid targeted diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, its adoption is limited by the high cost of expert annotations required for training and inter-observer variability in datasets. While weakly-supervised methods mitigate some challenges, using binary histology labels for training as opposed to requiring full segmentation, they require large paired datasets of histology and images, which are difficult to curate. Similarly, promptable segmentation aims to allow segmentation with no re-training for new tasks at inference, however, existing models perform poorly on pathological regions, again necessitating large datasets for training. In this work we propose a novel approach for promptable segmentation requiring only 24 fully-segmented images, supplemented by 8 weakly-labelled images, for training. Curating this minimal data to a high standard is relatively feasible and thus issues with the cost and variability of obtaining labels can be mitigated. By leveraging two classifiers, one weakly-supervised and one fully-supervised, our method refines segmentation through a guided search process initiated by a single-point prompt. Our approach outperforms existing promptable segmentation methods, and performs comparably with fully-supervised methods, for the task of prostate cancer segmentation, while using substantially less annotated data (up to 100X less). This enables promptable segmentation with very minimal labelled data, such that the labels can be curated to a very high standard.

- **Summary**: Determining the type of kidney stones is crucial for prescribing appropriate treatments to prevent recurrence. Currently, various approaches exist to identify the type of kidney stones. However, obtaining results through the reference ex vivo identification procedure can take several weeks, while in vivo visual recognition requires highly trained specialists. For this reason, deep learning models have been developed to provide urologists with an automated classification of kidney stones during ureteroscopies. Nevertheless, a common issue with these models is the lack of training data. This contribution presents a deep learning method based on few-shot learning, aimed at producing sufficiently discriminative features for identifying kidney stone types in endoscopic images, even with a very limited number of samples. This approach was specifically designed for scenarios where endoscopic images are scarce or where uncommon classes are present, enabling classification even with a limited training dataset. The results demonstrate that Prototypical Networks, using up to 25% of the training data, can achieve performance equal to or better than traditional deep learning models trained with the complete dataset.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep learning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through annotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for each new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation foundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., "segment the optic disc in an eye fundus image"), our method uses a grounding model to generate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module that enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation model to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and result verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a set of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model representations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization, guided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our pipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot medical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on seven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper decomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline performs competitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.

- **Summary**: We present SplatCo, a structure-view collaborative Gaussian splatting framework for high-fidelity rendering of complex outdoor environments. SplatCo builds upon two novel components: (1) a cross-structure collaboration module that combines global tri-plane representations, which capture coarse scene layouts, with local context grid features that represent fine surface details. This fusion is achieved through a novel hierarchical compensation strategy, ensuring both global consistency and local detail preservation; and (2) a cross-view assisted training strategy that enhances multi-view consistency by synchronizing gradient updates across viewpoints, applying visibility-aware densification, and pruning overfitted or inaccurate Gaussians based on structural consistency. Through joint optimization of structural representation and multi-view coherence, SplatCo effectively reconstructs fine-grained geometric structures and complex textures in large-scale scenes. Comprehensive evaluations on 13 diverse large-scale scenes, including Mill19, MatrixCity, Tanks & Temples, WHU, and custom aerial captures, demonstrate that SplatCo consistently achieves higher reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art methods, with PSNR improvements of 1-2 dB and SSIM gains of 0.1 to 0.2. These results establish a new benchmark for high-fidelity rendering of large-scale unbounded scenes. Code and additional information are available at https://github.com/SCUT-BIP-Lab/SplatCo.

- **Summary**: Understanding visual scenes is fundamental to human intelligence. While discriminative models have significantly advanced computer vision, they often struggle with compositional understanding. In contrast, recent generative text-to-image diffusion models excel at synthesizing complex scenes, suggesting inherent compositional capabilities. Building on this, zero-shot diffusion classifiers have been proposed to repurpose diffusion models for discriminative tasks. While prior work offered promising results in discriminative compositional scenarios, these results remain preliminary due to a small number of benchmarks and a relatively shallow analysis of conditions under which the models succeed. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of the discriminative capabilities of diffusion classifiers on a wide range of compositional tasks. Specifically, our study covers three diffusion models (SD 1.5, 2.0, and, for the first time, 3-m) spanning 10 datasets and over 30 tasks. Further, we shed light on the role that target dataset domains play in respective performance; to isolate the domain effects, we introduce a new diagnostic benchmark Self-Bench comprised of images created by diffusion models themselves. Finally, we explore the importance of timestep weighting and uncover a relationship between domain gap and timestep sensitivity, particularly for SD3-m. To sum up, diffusion classifiers understand compositionality, but conditions apply! Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/eugene6923/Diffusion-Classifiers-Compositionality.

- **Summary**: Owing to the typical long-tail data distribution issues, simulating domain-gap-free synthetic data is crucial in robotics, photogrammetry, and computer vision research. The fundamental challenge pertains to credibly measuring the difference between real and simulated data. Such a measure is vital for safety-critical applications, such as automated driving, where out-of-domain samples may impact a car's perception and cause fatal accidents. Previous work has commonly focused on simulating data on one scene and analyzing performance on a different, real-world scene, hampering the disjoint analysis of domain gap coming from networks' deficiencies, class definitions, and object representation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to measuring the domain gap between the real world sensor observations and simulated data representing the same location, enabling comprehensive domain gap analysis. To measure such a domain gap, we introduce a novel metric DoGSS-PCL and evaluation assessing the geometric and semantic quality of the simulated point cloud. Our experiments corroborate that the introduced approach can be used to measure the domain gap. The tests also reveal that synthetic semantic point clouds may be used for training deep neural networks, maintaining the performance at the 50/50 real-to-synthetic ratio. We strongly believe that this work will facilitate research on credible data simulation and allow for at-scale deployment in automated driving testing and digital twinning.

- **Summary**: This paper evaluates single-view mesh reconstruction models for creating digital twin environments in robot manipulation. Recent advances in computer vision for 3D reconstruction from single viewpoints present a potential breakthrough for efficiently creating virtual replicas of physical environments for robotics contexts. However, their suitability for physics simulations and robotics applications remains unexplored. We establish benchmarking criteria for 3D reconstruction in robotics contexts, including handling typical inputs, producing collision-free and stable reconstructions, managing occlusions, and meeting computational constraints. Our empirical evaluation using realistic robotics datasets shows that despite success on computer vision benchmarks, existing approaches fail to meet robotics-specific requirements. We quantitively examine limitations of single-view reconstruction for practical robotics implementation, in contrast to prior work that focuses on multi-view approaches. Our findings highlight critical gaps between computer vision advances and robotics needs, guiding future research at this intersection.

- **Summary**: We present a fully automated, anatomically guided deep learning pipeline for prostate cancer (PCa) risk stratification using routine MRI. The pipeline integrates three key components: an nnU-Net module for segmenting the prostate gland and its zones on axial T2-weighted MRI; a classification module based on the UMedPT Swin Transformer foundation model, fine-tuned on 3D patches with optional anatomical priors and clinical data; and a VAE-GAN framework for generating counterfactual heatmaps that localize decision-driving image regions. The system was developed using 1,500 PI-CAI cases for segmentation and 617 biparametric MRIs with metadata from the CHAIMELEON challenge for classification (split into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% testing). Segmentation achieved mean Dice scores of 0.95 (gland), 0.94 (peripheral zone), and 0.92 (transition zone). Incorporating gland priors improved AUC from 0.69 to 0.72, with a three-scale ensemble achieving top performance (AUC = 0.79, composite score = 0.76), outperforming the 2024 CHAIMELEON challenge winners. Counterfactual heatmaps reliably highlighted lesions within segmented regions, enhancing model interpretability. In a prospective multi-center in-silico trial with 20 clinicians, AI assistance increased diagnostic accuracy from 0.72 to 0.77 and Cohen's kappa from 0.43 to 0.53, while reducing review time per case by 40%. These results demonstrate that anatomy-aware foundation models with counterfactual explainability can enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient PCa risk assessment, supporting their potential use as virtual biopsies in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Feature engineering for generalized seizure detection models remains a significant challenge. Recently proposed models show variable performance depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end model, ''Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet),'' which efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram (EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution. The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly score-based post-classification processing technique was introduced to reduce the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results were reported and analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177 to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9% and 20.62%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Feature matching is a necessary step for many computer vision and photogrammetry applications such as image registration, structure-from-motion, and visual localization. Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature detection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC outlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With recent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and proven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions. Despite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical and learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D building camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission systematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching techniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use standard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets consisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and drone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute pose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric ground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data. The results indicate that the learnable feature matching methods vastly outperform traditional approaches regarding accuracy and robustness on our challenging custom datasets with zero to 12 RANSAC-inliers and zero to 0.16 area under the curve. We believe that this work will foster the development of model-based visual localization methods. Link to the code: https://github.com/simBauer/To\_Glue\_or\_not\_to\_Glue

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

- **Summary**: 3D reconstruction from 2D inputs, especially for non-rigid objects like humans, presents unique challenges due to the significant range of possible deformations. Traditional methods often struggle with non-rigid shapes, which require extensive training data to cover the entire deformation space. This study addresses these limitations by proposing a canonical pose reconstruction model that transforms single-view depth images of deformable shapes into a canonical form. This alignment facilitates shape reconstruction by enabling the application of rigid object reconstruction techniques, and supports recovering the input pose in voxel representation as part of the reconstruction task, utilizing both the original and deformed depth images. Notably, our model achieves effective results with only a small dataset of approximately 300 samples. Experimental results on animal and human datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Open-set image segmentation poses a significant challenge because existing methods often demand extensive training or fine-tuning and generally struggle to segment unified objects consistently across diverse text reference expressions. Motivated by this, we propose Segment Anyword, a novel training-free visual concept prompt learning approach for open-set language grounded segmentation that relies on token-level cross-attention maps from a frozen diffusion model to produce segmentation surrogates or mask prompts, which are then refined into targeted object masks. Initial prompts typically lack coherence and consistency as the complexity of the image-text increases, resulting in suboptimal mask fragments. To tackle this issue, we further introduce a novel linguistic-guided visual prompt regularization that binds and clusters visual prompts based on sentence dependency and syntactic structural information, enabling the extraction of robust, noise-tolerant mask prompts, and significant improvements in segmentation accuracy. The proposed approach is effective, generalizes across different open-set segmentation tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art results of 52.5 (+6.8 relative) mIoU on Pascal Context 59, 67.73 (+25.73 relative) cIoU on gRefCOCO, and 67.4 (+1.1 relative to fine-tuned methods) mIoU on GranDf, which is the most complex open-set grounded segmentation task in the field.

- **Summary**: Accurate, real-time monitoring of tissue ischemia is crucial to understand tissue health and guide surgery. Spectral imaging shows great potential for contactless and intraoperative monitoring of tissue oxygenation. Due to the difficulty of obtaining direct reference oxygenation values, conventional methods are based on linear unmixing techniques. These are prone to assumptions and these linear relations may not always hold in practice. In this work, we present deep learning approaches for real-time tissue oxygenation estimation using Monte-Carlo simulated spectra. We train a fully connected neural network (FCN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for this task and propose a domain-adversarial training approach to bridge the gap between simulated and real clinical spectral data. Results demonstrate that these deep learning models achieve a higher correlation with capillary lactate measurements, a well-known marker of hypoxia, obtained during spectral imaging in surgery, compared to traditional linear unmixing. Notably, domain-adversarial training effectively reduces the domain gap, optimizing performance in real clinical settings.

- **Summary**: Reliability and generalization in deep learning are predominantly studied in the context of image classification. Yet, real-world applications in safety-critical domains involve a broader set of semantic tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, which come with a diverse set of dedicated model architectures. To facilitate research towards robust model design in segmentation and detection, our primary objective is to provide benchmarking tools regarding robustness to distribution shifts and adversarial manipulations. We propose the benchmarking tools SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH, along with the most extensive evaluation to date on the reliability and generalization of semantic segmentation and object detection models. In particular, we benchmark 76 segmentation models across four datasets and 61 object detectors across two datasets, evaluating their performance under diverse adversarial attacks and common corruptions. Our findings reveal systematic weaknesses in state-of-the-art models and uncover key trends based on architecture, backbone, and model capacity. SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH are open-sourced in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/benchmarking_reliability_generalization) along with our complete set of total 6139 evaluations. We anticipate the collected data to foster and encourage future research towards improved model reliability beyond classification.

- **Summary**: Accurate information on the number of building floors, or above-ground storeys, is essential for household estimation, utility provision, risk assessment, evacuation planning, and energy modeling. Yet large-scale floor-count data are rarely available in cadastral and 3D city databases. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that infers floor numbers directly from unrestricted, crowdsourced street-level imagery, avoiding hand-crafted features and generalizing across diverse facade styles. To enable benchmarking, we release the Munich Building Floor Dataset, a public set of over 6800 geo-tagged images collected from Mapillary and targeted field photography, each paired with a verified storey label. On this dataset, the proposed classification-regression network attains 81.2% exact accuracy and predicts 97.9% of buildings within +/-1 floor. The method and dataset together offer a scalable route to enrich 3D city models with vertical information and lay a foundation for future work in urban informatics, remote sensing, and geographic information science.

- **Summary**: We aim to develop a robust yet flexible visual foundation model for Earth observation. It should possess strong capabilities in recognizing and localizing diverse visual targets while providing compatibility with various input-output interfaces required across different task scenarios. Current systems cannot meet these requirements, as they typically utilize task-specific architecture trained on narrow data domains with limited semantic coverage. Our study addresses these limitations from two aspects: data and modeling. We first introduce an automatic data engine that enjoys significantly better scalability compared to previous human annotation or rule-based approaches. It has enabled us to create the largest dataset of its kind to date, comprising 270K image-text-mask triplets covering an unprecedented range of diverse semantic categories and attribute specifications. Based on this data foundation, we further propose a task unification paradigm that centers around referring expression segmentation. It effectively handles a wide range of vision-centric perception tasks, including classification, detection, segmentation, grounding, etc, using a single model without any task-specific heads. Combining these innovations on data and modeling, we present RemoteSAM, a foundation model that establishes new SoTA on several earth observation perception benchmarks, outperforming other foundation models such as Falcon, GeoChat, and LHRS-Bot with significantly higher efficiency. Models and data are publicly available at https://github.com/1e12Leon/RemoteSAM.



### A Wavelet-based Stereo Matching Framework for Solving Frequency Convergence Inconsistency

- **Summary**: We find that the EPE evaluation metrics of RAFT-stereo converge inconsistently in the low and high frequency regions, resulting high frequency degradation (e.g., edges and thin objects) during the iterative process. The underlying reason for the limited performance of current iterative methods is that it optimizes all frequency components together without distinguishing between high and low frequencies. We propose a wavelet-based stereo matching framework (Wavelet-Stereo) for solving frequency convergence inconsistency. Specifically, we first explicitly decompose an image into high and low frequency components using discrete wavelet transform. Then, the high-frequency and low-frequency components are fed into two different multi-scale frequency feature extractors. Finally, we propose a novel LSTM-based high-frequency preservation update operator containing an iterative frequency adapter to provide adaptive refined high-frequency features at different iteration steps by fine-tuning the initial high-frequency features. By processing high and low frequency components separately, our framework can simultaneously refine high-frequency information in edges and low-frequency information in smooth regions, which is especially suitable for challenging scenes with fine details and textures in the distance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Wavelet-Stereo outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and ranks 1st on both the KITTI 2015 and KITTI 2012 leaderboards for almost all metrics. We will provide code and pre-trained models to encourage further exploration, application, and development of our innovative framework (https://github.com/SIA-IDE/Wavelet-Stereo).

- **Comment**: To be published in IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face
  and Gesture Recognition, 2025
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Computing the standard benchmark metric for 3D face reconstruction, namely geometric error, requires a number of steps, such as mesh cropping, rigid alignment, or point correspondence. Current benchmark tools are monolithic (they implement a specific combination of these steps), even though there is no consensus on the best way to measure error. We present a toolkit for a Modularized 3D Face reconstruction Benchmark (M3DFB), where the fundamental components of error computation are segregated and interchangeable, allowing one to quantify the effect of each. Furthermore, we propose a new component, namely correction, and present a computationally efficient approach that penalizes for mesh topology inconsistency. Using this toolkit, we test 16 error estimators with 10 reconstruction methods on two real and two synthetic datasets. Critically, the widely used ICP-based estimator provides the worst benchmarking performance, as it significantly alters the true ranking of the top-5 reconstruction methods. Notably, the correlation of ICP with the true error can be as low as 0.41. Moreover, non-rigid alignment leads to significant improvement (correlation larger than 0.90), highlighting the importance of annotating 3D landmarks on datasets. Finally, the proposed correction scheme, together with non-rigid warping, leads to an accuracy on a par with the best non-rigid ICP-based estimators, but runs an order of magnitude faster. Our open-source codebase is designed for researchers to easily compare alternatives for each component, thus helping accelerating progress in benchmarking for 3D face reconstruction and, furthermore, supporting the improvement of learned reconstruction methods, which depend on accurate error estimation for effective training.

- **Summary**: We propose KnotGym, an interactive environment for complex, spatial reasoning and manipulation. KnotGym includes goal-oriented rope manipulation tasks with varying levels of complexity, all requiring acting from pure image observations. Tasks are defined along a clear and quantifiable axis of complexity based on the number of knot crossings, creating a natural generalization test. KnotGym has a simple observation space, allowing for scalable development, yet it highlights core challenges in integrating acute perception, spatial reasoning, and grounded manipulation. We evaluate methods of different classes, including model-based RL, model-predictive control, and chain-of-thought reasoning, and illustrate the challenges KnotGym presents.

- **Summary**: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) examples is an important task for deploying reliable machine learning models in safety-critial applications. While post-hoc methods based on the Mahalanobis distance applied to pre-logit features are among the most effective for ImageNet-scale OOD detection, their performance varies significantly across models. We connect this inconsistency to strong variations in feature norms, indicating severe violations of the Gaussian assumption underlying the Mahalanobis distance estimation. We show that simple $\ell_2$-normalization of the features mitigates this problem effectively, aligning better with the premise of normally distributed data with shared covariance matrix. Extensive experiments on 44 models across diverse architectures and pretraining schemes show that $\ell_2$-normalization improves the conventional Mahalanobis distance-based approaches significantly and consistently, and outperforms other recently proposed OOD detection methods.

We propose CAMME (Cross-Attention Multi-Modal Embeddings), a framework that dynamically integrates visual, textual, and frequency-domain features through a multi-head cross-attention mechanism to establish robust cross-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate CAMME's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, yielding improvements of 12.56% on natural scenes and 13.25% on facial deepfakes. The framework demonstrates exceptional resilience, maintaining (over 91%) accuracy under natural image perturbations and achieving 89.01% and 96.14% accuracy against PGD and FGSM adversarial attacks, respectively. Our findings validate that integrating complementary modalities through cross-attention enables more effective decision boundary realignment for reliable deepfake detection across heterogeneous generative architectures.

- **Summary**: Foundation models like CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) have revolutionized vision-language tasks by enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning through cross-modal alignment. However, their computational complexity and large memory footprint make them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, such as in-car cameras used for image collection and real-time processing. To address this challenge, we propose Clip4Retrofit, an efficient model distillation framework that enables real-time image labeling on edge devices. The framework is deployed on the Retrofit camera, a cost-effective edge device retrofitted into thousands of vehicles, despite strict limitations on compute performance and memory. Our approach distills the knowledge of the CLIP model into a lightweight student model, combining EfficientNet-B3 with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) projection heads to preserve cross-modal alignment while significantly reducing computational requirements. We demonstrate that our distilled model achieves a balance between efficiency and performance, making it ideal for deployment in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that Clip4Retrofit can perform real-time image labeling and object identification on edge devices with limited resources, offering a practical solution for applications such as autonomous driving and retrofitting existing systems. This work bridges the gap between state-of-the-art vision-language models and their deployment in resource-constrained environments, paving the way for broader adoption of foundation models in edge computing.

- **Summary**: The use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) such as Stable Diffusion has significantly improved the perceptual quality of All-in-One image Restoration (AiOR) methods, while also enhancing their generalization capabilities. However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel generative approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in restoration performance while achieving over $\mathbf{10\times}$ faster inference. RestoreVAR leverages visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a recently introduced approach which performs scale-space autoregression for image generation. VAR achieves comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational costs. To optimally exploit these advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

- **Summary**: Computer vision (CV) models for detection, prediction or classification tasks operate on video data-streams that are often degraded in the real world, due to deployment in real-time or on resource-constrained hardware. It is therefore critical that these models are robust to degraded data, but state of the art (SoTA) models are often insufficiently assessed with these real-world constraints in mind. This is exemplified by Skeletal Human Action Recognition (SHAR), which is critical in many CV pipelines operating in real-time and at the edge, but robustness to degraded data has previously only been shallowly and inconsistently assessed. Here we address this issue for SHAR by providing an important first data degradation benchmark on the most detailed and largest 3D open dataset, NTU-RGB+D-120, and assess the robustness of five leading SHAR models to three forms of degradation that represent real-world issues. We demonstrate the need for this benchmark by showing that the form of degradation, which has not previously been considered, has a large impact on model accuracy; at the same effective frame rate, model accuracy can vary by >40% depending on degradation type. We also identify that temporal regularity of frames in degraded SHAR data is likely a major driver of differences in model performance, and harness this to improve performance of existing models by up to >40%, through employing a simple mitigation approach based on interpolation. Finally, we highlight how our benchmark has helped identify an important degradation-resistant SHAR model based in Rough Path Theory; the LogSigRNN SHAR model outperforms the SoTA DeGCN model in five out of six cases at low frame rates by an average accuracy of 6%, despite trailing the SoTA model by 11-12% on un-degraded data at high frame rates (30 FPS).

- **Summary**: Neuromorphic Visual Systems, such as spike cameras, have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to capture clear textures under dynamic conditions. This capability effectively mitigates issues related to motion and aperture blur. However, in contrast to conventional RGB modalities that provide dense spatial information, these systems generate binary, spatially sparse frames as a trade-off for temporally rich visual streams. In this context, generative models emerge as a promising solution to address the inherent limitations of sparse data. These models not only facilitate the conditional fusion of existing information from both spike and RGB modalities but also enable the conditional generation based on latent priors. In this study, we introduce a robust generative processing framework named SpikeGen, designed for visual spike streams captured by spike cameras. We evaluate this framework across multiple tasks involving mixed spike-RGB modalities, including conditional image/video deblurring, dense frame reconstruction from spike streams, and high-speed scene novel-view synthesis. Supported by comprehensive experimental results, we demonstrate that leveraging the latent space operation abilities of generative models allows us to effectively address the sparsity of spatial information while fully exploiting the temporal richness of spike streams, thereby promoting a synergistic enhancement of different visual modalities.

- **Summary**: Vision transformers are ever larger, more accurate, and more expensive to compute. The expense is even more extreme at high resolution as the number of tokens grows quadratically with the image size. We turn to adaptive computation to cope with this cost by learning to predict where to compute. Our LookWhere method divides the computation between a low-resolution selector and a high-resolution extractor without ever processing the full high-resolution input. We jointly pretrain the selector and extractor without task supervision by distillation from a self-supervised teacher, in effect, learning where and what to compute simultaneously. Unlike prior token reduction methods, which pay to save by pruning already-computed tokens, and prior token selection methods, which require complex and expensive per-task optimization, LookWhere economically and accurately selects and extracts transferrable representations of images. We show that LookWhere excels at sparse recognition on high-resolution inputs (Traffic Signs), maintaining accuracy while reducing FLOPs by up to 34x and time by 6x. It also excels at standard recognition tasks that are global (ImageNet classification) or local (ADE20K segmentation), improving accuracy while reducing time by 1.36x.

- **Summary**: Existed echocardiography segmentation methods often suffer from anatomical inconsistency challenge caused by shape variation, partial observation and region ambiguity with similar intensity across 2D echocardiographic sequences, resulting in false positive segmentation with anatomical defeated structures in challenging low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To provide a strong anatomical guarantee across different echocardiographic frames, we propose a novel segmentation framework named BOTM (Bi-directional Optimal Token Matching) that performs echocardiography segmentation and optimal anatomy transportation simultaneously. Given paired echocardiographic images, BOTM learns to match two sets of discrete image tokens by finding optimal correspondences from a novel anatomical transportation perspective. We further extend the token matching into a bi-directional cross-transport attention proxy to regulate the preserved anatomical consistency within the cardiac cyclic deformation in temporal domain. Extensive experimental results show that BOTM can generate stable and accurate segmentation outcomes (e.g. -1.917 HD on CAMUS2H LV, +1.9% Dice on TED), and provide a better matching interpretation with anatomical consistency guarantee.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning as a parameter-efficient method that has been widely adopted to adapt Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. While hard-prompt design requires domain expertise and iterative optimization, soft-prompt methods rely heavily on task-specific hard labels, limiting their generalization to unseen categories. Recent popular distillation-based prompt learning methods improve generalization by exploiting larger teacher VLMs and unsupervised knowledge transfer, yet their repetitive teacher model online inference sacrifices the inherent training efficiency advantage of prompt learning. In this paper, we propose {{\large {\textbf{F}}}}aster {{\large {\textbf{D}}}}istillation-{{\large {\textbf{B}}}}ased {{\large {\textbf{P}}}}rompt {{\large {\textbf{L}}}}earning (\textbf{FDBPL}), which addresses these issues by sharing soft supervision contexts across multiple training stages and implementing accelerated I/O. Furthermore, FDBPL introduces a region-aware prompt learning paradigm with dual positive-negative prompt spaces to fully exploit randomly cropped regions that containing multi-level information. We propose a positive-negative space mutual learning mechanism based on similarity-difference learning, enabling student CLIP models to recognize correct semantics while learning to reject weakly related concepts, thereby improving zero-shot performance. Unlike existing distillation-based prompt learning methods that sacrifice parameter efficiency for generalization, FDBPL maintains dual advantages of parameter efficiency and strong downstream generalization. Comprehensive evaluations across 11 datasets demonstrate superior performance in base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset transfer, and robustness tests, achieving $2.2\times$ faster training speed.

- **Summary**: Background: Accurate MRI-based identification of extramural vascular invasion (EVI) and mesorectal fascia invasion (MFI) is pivotal for risk-stratified management of rectal cancer, yet visual assessment is subjective and vulnerable to inter-institutional variability. Purpose: To develop and externally evaluate a multicenter, foundation-model-driven framework that automatically classifies EVI and MFI on axial and sagittal T2-weighted MRI. Methods: This retrospective study used 331 pre-treatment rectal cancer MRI examinations from three European hospitals. After TotalSegmentator-guided rectal patch extraction, a self-supervised frequency-domain harmonization pipeline was trained to minimize scanner-related contrast shifts. Four classifiers were compared: ResNet50, SeResNet, the universal biomedical pretrained transformer (UMedPT) with a lightweight MLP head, and a logistic-regression variant using frozen UMedPT features (UMedPT_LR). Results: UMedPT_LR achieved the best EVI detection when axial and sagittal features were fused (AUC = 0.82; sensitivity = 0.75; F1 score = 0.73), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.74). The highest MFI performance was attained by UMedPT on axial harmonized images (AUC = 0.77), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.75). Frequency-domain harmonization improved MFI classification but variably affected EVI performance. Conventional CNNs (ResNet50, SeResNet) underperformed, especially in F1 score and balanced accuracy. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that combining foundation model features, harmonization, and multi-view fusion significantly enhances diagnostic performance in rectal MRI.

- **Summary**: Establishing semantic correspondence is a challenging task in computer vision, aiming to match keypoints with the same semantic information across different images. Benefiting from the rapid development of deep learning, remarkable progress has been made over the past decade. However, a comprehensive review and analysis of this task remains absent. In this paper, we present the first extensive survey of semantic correspondence methods. We first propose a taxonomy to classify existing methods based on the type of their method designs. These methods are then categorized accordingly, and we provide a detailed analysis of each approach. Furthermore, we aggregate and summarize the results of methods in literature across various benchmarks into a unified comparative table, with detailed configurations to highlight performance variations. Additionally, to provide a detailed understanding on existing methods for semantic matching, we thoroughly conduct controlled experiments to analyse the effectiveness of the components of different methods. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective baseline that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, providing a solid foundation for future research in this field. We hope this survey serves as a comprehensive reference and consolidated baseline for future development. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Visual-AI/Semantic-Correspondence.

- **Summary**: Controllable video generation (CVG) has advanced rapidly, yet current systems falter when more than one actor must move, interact, and exchange positions under noisy control signals. We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce (i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii) HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital production, simulation, and embodied intelligence.

- **Summary**: Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks. The code will be released later.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enabled promising applications in medical tasks, such as report generation and visual question answering. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic answer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically meaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench, a structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting anatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements, computing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench leverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid reasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance, enabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning. The benchmark comprises 18,988 QA pairs across 12 diagnostic tasks and 1,200 cases, each paired with up to 4 visual inputs, and supports multi-path, multi-stage evaluation including visual grounding via anatomical region selection and diagnostic measurements. Even the strongest of 10 evaluated LVLMs struggle with structured reasoning and generalization, often failing to link abstract knowledge with anatomically grounded visual interpretation.

- **Summary**: In face-to-face conversations, individuals need to switch between speaking and listening roles seamlessly. Existing 3D talking head generation models focus solely on speaking or listening, neglecting the natural dynamics of interactive conversation, which leads to unnatural interactions and awkward transitions. To address this issue, we propose a new task -- multi-round dual-speaker interaction for 3D talking head generation -- which requires models to handle and generate both speaking and listening behaviors in continuous conversation. To solve this task, we introduce DualTalk, a novel unified framework that integrates the dynamic behaviors of speakers and listeners to simulate realistic and coherent dialogue interactions. This framework not only synthesizes lifelike talking heads when speaking but also generates continuous and vivid non-verbal feedback when listening, effectively capturing the interplay between the roles. We also create a new dataset featuring 50 hours of multi-round conversations with over 1,000 characters, where participants continuously switch between speaking and listening roles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the naturalness and expressiveness of 3D talking heads in dual-speaker conversations.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks have become a well-explored domain, frequently serving as evaluation baselines for model robustness. Among these, black-box attacks based on transferability have received significant attention due to their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. Traditional black-box methods have generally focused on improving the optimization framework (e.g., utilizing momentum in MI-FGSM) to enhance transferability, rather than examining the dependency on surrogate white-box model architectures. Recent state-of-the-art approach DiffPGD has demonstrated enhanced transferability by employing diffusion-based adversarial purification models for adaptive attacks. The inductive bias of diffusion-based adversarial purification aligns naturally with the adversarial attack process, where both involving noise addition, reducing dependency on surrogate white-box model selection. However, the denoising process of diffusion models incurs substantial computational costs through chain rule derivation, manifested in excessive VRAM consumption and extended runtime. This progression prompts us to question whether introducing diffusion models is necessary. We hypothesize that a model sharing similar inductive bias to diffusion-based adversarial purification, combined with an appropriate loss function, could achieve comparable or superior transferability while dramatically reducing computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function coupled with a unique surrogate model to validate our hypothesis. Our approach leverages the score of the time-dependent classifier from classifier-guided diffusion models, effectively incorporating natural data distribution knowledge into the adversarial optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate significantly improved transferability across diverse model architectures while maintaining robustness against diffusion-based defenses.

- **Summary**: Nanomaterial research is becoming a vital area for energy, medicine, and materials science, and accurate analysis of the nanoparticle topology is essential to determine their properties. Unfortunately, the lack of high-quality annotated datasets drastically hinders the creation of strong segmentation models for nanoscale imaging. To alleviate this problem, we introduce F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle consistent generative adversarial system that can be trained using a limited number of data samples and generates realistic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly from segmentation maps. Our model uses a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net segmentation network equipped with self-attention to capture structural relationships and applies augmentation methods to increase the variety of the dataset. The architecture reached a raw FID score of 17.65 for TiO$_2$ dataset generation, with a further reduction in FID score to nearly 10.39 by using efficient post-processing techniques. By facilitating scalable high-fidelity synthetic dataset generation, our approach can improve the effectiveness of downstream segmentation task training, overcoming severe data shortage issues in nanoparticle analysis, thus extending its applications to resource-limited fields.

- **Summary**: As learned image compression (LIC) methods become increasingly computationally demanding, enhancing their training efficiency is crucial. This paper takes a step forward in accelerating the training of LIC methods by modeling the neural training dynamics. We first propose a Sensitivity-aware True and Dummy Embedding Training mechanism (STDET) that clusters LIC model parameters into few separate modes where parameters are expressed as affine transformations of reference parameters within the same mode. By further utilizing the stable intra-mode correlations throughout training and parameter sensitivities, we gradually embed non-reference parameters, reducing the number of trainable parameters. Additionally, we incorporate a Sampling-then-Moving Average (SMA) technique, interpolating sampled weights from stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training to obtain the moving average weights, ensuring smooth temporal behavior and minimizing training state variances. Overall, our method significantly reduces training space dimensions and the number of trainable parameters without sacrificing model performance, thus accelerating model convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the Noisy quadratic model, showing that the proposed method achieves a lower training variance than standard SGD. Our approach offers valuable insights for further developing efficient training methods for LICs.

- **Summary**: Visual Instruction Tuning (VisIT) data, commonly available as human-assistant conversations with images interleaved in the human turns, are currently the most widespread vehicle for aligning strong LLMs to understand visual inputs, converting them to strong LMMs. While many VisIT datasets are available, most are constructed using ad-hoc techniques developed independently by different groups. They are often poorly documented, lack reproducible code, and rely on paid, closed-source model APIs such as GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude to convert image metadata (labels) into VisIT instructions. This leads to high costs and makes it challenging to scale, enhance quality, or generate VisIT data for new datasets. In this work, we address these challenges and propose an open and unified recipe and approach,~\textbf{\method}, for converting available metadata to VisIT instructions using open LLMs. Our multi-stage \method features an efficient framework for metadata grouping, quality control, data and prompt organization, and conversation sampling. We show that our approach can reproduce or enhance the data quality of available VisIT datasets when applied to the same image data and metadata sources, improving GPT-4 generated VisIT instructions by ~3\% on average and up to 12\% on individual benchmarks using open models, such as Gemma 2 27B and LLaMa 3.1 70B. Additionally, our approach enables effective performance scaling - both in quantity and quality - by enhancing the resulting LMM performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We also analyze the impact of various factors, including conversation format, base model selection, and resampling strategies. Our code, which supports the reproduction of equal or higher-quality VisIT datasets and facilities future metadata-to-VisIT data conversion for niche domains, is released at https://github.com/jacob-hansen/Instructify.

- **Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the use of RL beyond reasoning tasks remains largely unexplored, especially for perceptionintensive tasks like object detection and grounding. We propose V-Triune, a Visual Triple Unified Reinforcement Learning system that enables VLMs to jointly learn visual reasoning and perception tasks within a single training pipeline. V-Triune comprises triple complementary components: Sample-Level Data Formatting (to unify diverse task inputs), Verifier-Level Reward Computation (to deliver custom rewards via specialized verifiers) , and Source-Level Metric Monitoring (to diagnose problems at the data-source level). We further introduce a novel Dynamic IoU reward, which provides adaptive, progressive, and definite feedback for perception tasks handled by V-Triune. Our approach is instantiated within off-the-shelf RL training framework using open-source 7B and 32B backbone models. The resulting model, dubbed Orsta (One RL to See Them All), demonstrates consistent improvements across both reasoning and perception tasks. This broad capability is significantly shaped by its training on a diverse dataset, constructed around four representative visual reasoning tasks (Math, Puzzle, Chart, and Science) and four visual perception tasks (Grounding, Detection, Counting, and OCR). Subsequently, Orsta achieves substantial gains on MEGA-Bench Core, with improvements ranging from +2.1 to an impressive +14.1 across its various 7B and 32B model variants, with performance benefits extending to a wide range of downstream tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our unified RL approach for VLMs. The V-Triune system, along with the Orsta models, is publicly available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI.

- **Summary**: Large vision models (LVM) based gait recognition has achieved impressive performance. However, existing LVM-based approaches may overemphasize gait priors while neglecting the intrinsic value of LVM itself, particularly the rich, distinct representations across its multi-layers. To adequately unlock LVM's potential, this work investigates the impact of layer-wise representations on downstream recognition tasks. Our analysis reveals that LVM's intermediate layers offer complementary properties across tasks, integrating them yields an impressive improvement even without rich well-designed gait priors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple and universal baseline for LVM-based gait recognition, termed BiggerGait. Comprehensive evaluations on CCPG, CAISA-B*, SUSTech1K, and CCGR\_MINI validate the superiority of BiggerGait across both within- and cross-domain tasks, establishing it as a simple yet practical baseline for gait representation learning. All the models and code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved strong results on coding and math benchmarks that are challenging for humans, yet their ability to perform tasks that come naturally to humans--such as perception, spatial navigation, and memory management--remains understudied. Real video games are crafted to be intuitive for humans to learn and master by leveraging innate inductive biases, making them an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities in VLMs. To this end, we introduce VideoGameBench, a benchmark consisting of 10 popular video games from the 1990s that VLMs directly interact with in real-time. VideoGameBench challenges models to complete entire games with access to only raw visual inputs and a high-level description of objectives and controls, a significant departure from existing setups that rely on game-specific scaffolding and auxiliary information. We keep three of the games secret to encourage solutions that generalize to unseen environments. Our experiments show that frontier vision-language models struggle to progress beyond the beginning of each game. We find inference latency to be a major limitation of frontier models in the real-time setting; therefore, we introduce VideoGameBench Lite, a setting where the game pauses while waiting for the LM's next action. The best performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, completes only 0.48% of VideoGameBench and 1.6% of VideoGameBench Lite. We hope that the formalization of the human skills mentioned above into this benchmark motivates progress in these research directions.

- **Summary**: The open set recognition (OSR) problem aims to identify test samples from novel semantic classes that are not part of the training classes, a task that is crucial in many practical scenarios. However, existing OSR methods use a constant scaling factor (the temperature) to the logits before applying a loss function, which hinders the model from exploring both ends of the spectrum in representation learning -- from instance-level to semantic-level features. In this paper, we address this problem by enabling temperature-modulated representation learning using our novel negative cosine scheduling scheme. Our scheduling lets the model form a coarse decision boundary at the beginning of training by focusing on fewer neighbors, and gradually prioritizes more neighbors to smooth out rough edges. This gradual task switching leads to a richer and more generalizable representation space. While other OSR methods benefit by including regularization or auxiliary negative samples, such as with mix-up, thereby adding a significant computational overhead, our scheme can be folded into any existing OSR method with no overhead. We implement the proposed scheme on top of a number of baselines, using both cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions as well as a few other OSR methods, and find that our scheme boosts both the OSR performance and the closed set performance in most cases, especially on the tougher semantic shift benchmarks.

- **Summary**: In this work, we reveal the limitations of visual tokenizers and VAEs in preserving fine-grained features, and propose a benchmark to evaluate reconstruction performance for two challenging visual contents: text and face. Image tokenization has significantly advanced visual generation and multimodal modeling, particularly with autoregressive models due to the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. Autoregressive models typically rely on image tokenizers to compress images into discrete tokens for sequential prediction, whereas diffusion models often operate on continuous latent space to reduce computational costs. However, both visual compression approaches inevitably lose visual information, thereby limiting the upper bound of visual generation quality. To evaluate how these compression losses affect text and faces, the most human-sensitive visual elements, we first collect and curate a collection of text and faces images from existing datasets, ensuring clarity and diversity. For text reconstruction, we employ OCR models to assess the recognition accuracy of the reconstructed text, and then we measure feature similarity between original and reconstructed faces thereby quantifying faces reconstruction fidelity. Our method is highly lightweight, requiring just 2GB memory and 4 minutes to complete evaluations. With our benchmark, we analyze the reconstruction quality of text and faces at various scales across different image tokenizers and VAEs. Our results demonstrate that modern visual tokenizers still struggle to preserve fine-grained features, particularly at smaller scales. Furthermore, we extend this evaluation framework to the video, conducting a comprehensive analysis of video tokenizers. Additionally, we find that traditional metrics fail to accurately reflect the reconstruction performance for faces and text, while our proposed metrics serve as an effective complement.

- **Summary**: WonderPlay is a novel framework integrating physics simulation with video generation for generating action-conditioned dynamic 3D scenes from a single image. While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic dynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a wide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics solver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video generator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated video is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop between the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables intuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of physics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video generators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to interact with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow, liquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input. Code will be made public. Project website: https://kyleleey.github.io/WonderPlay/

- **Summary**: We introduce the Region Encoder Network (REN), a fast and effective model for generating region-based image representations using point prompts. Recent methods combine class-agnostic segmenters (e.g., SAM) with patch-based image encoders (e.g., DINO) to produce compact and effective region representations, but they suffer from high computational cost due to the segmentation step. REN bypasses this bottleneck using a lightweight module that directly generates region tokens, enabling 60x faster token generation with 35x less memory, while also improving token quality. It uses a few cross-attention blocks that take point prompts as queries and features from a patch-based image encoder as keys and values to produce region tokens that correspond to the prompted objects. We train REN with three popular encoders-DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP-and show that it can be extended to other encoders without dedicated training. We evaluate REN on semantic segmentation and retrieval tasks, where it consistently outperforms the original encoders in both performance and compactness, and matches or exceeds SAM-based region methods while being significantly faster. Notably, REN achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging Ego4D VQ2D benchmark and outperforms proprietary LMMs on Visual Haystacks' single-needle challenge.
