- **Summary**: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) systems primarily focus on manual gestures, but non-manual features such as mouth movements, specifically mouthing, provide valuable linguistic information. This work directly classifies mouthing instances to their corresponding words in the spoken language while exploring the potential of transfer learning from Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) to mouthing recognition in German Sign Language. We leverage three VSR datasets: one in English, one in German with unrelated words and one in German containing the same target words as the mouthing dataset, to investigate the impact of task similarity in this setting. Our results demonstrate that multi-task learning improves both mouthing recognition and VSR accuracy as well as model robustness, suggesting that mouthing recognition should be treated as a distinct but related task to VSR. This research contributes to the field of SLR by proposing knowledge transfer from VSR to SLR datasets with limited mouthing annotations.

- **Summary**: This work presents a simple yet effective workflow for automatically scaling instruction-following data to elicit pixel-level grounding capabilities of VLMs under complex instructions. In particular, we address five critical real-world challenges in text-instruction-based grounding: hallucinated references, multi-object scenarios, reasoning, multi-granularity, and part-level references. By leveraging knowledge distillation from a pre-trained teacher model, our approach generates high-quality instruction-response pairs linked to existing pixel-level annotations, minimizing the need for costly human annotation. The resulting dataset, Ground-V, captures rich object localization knowledge and nuanced pixel-level referring expressions. Experiment results show that models trained on Ground-V exhibit substantial improvements across diverse grounding tasks. Specifically, incorporating Ground-V during training directly achieves an average accuracy boost of 4.4% for LISA and a 7.9% for PSALM across six benchmarks on the gIoU metric. It also sets new state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks such as RefCOCO/+/g. Notably, on gRefCOCO, we achieve an N-Acc of 83.3%, exceeding the previous state-of-the-art by more than 20%.

- **Summary**: Medical image captioning is a challenging task that requires generating clinically accurate and semantically meaningful descriptions of radiology images. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) such as BLIP, BLIP2, Gemini and ViT-GPT2 show strong performance on natural image datasets, they often produce generic or imprecise captions when applied to specialized medical domains. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning the BLIP model on the ROCO dataset for improved radiology captioning. We compare the fine-tuned BLIP against its zero-shot version, BLIP-2 base, BLIP-2 Instruct and a ViT-GPT2 transformer baseline. Our results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning on BLIP significantly improves performance across both quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics. We also visualize decoder cross-attention maps to assess interpretability and conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contributions of encoder-only and decoder-only fine-tuning. Our findings highlight the importance of targeted adaptation for medical applications and suggest that decoder-only fine-tuning (encoder-frozen) offers a strong performance baseline with 5% lower training time than full fine-tuning, while full model fine-tuning still yields the best results overall.

- **Summary**: Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images. Reader discretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated increasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving and medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world applications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align with human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing work on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies heavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced realism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs) using diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a comprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory, spanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in everyday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality image-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic annotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality annotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text. For evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \textit{moral judgment} and \textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral violations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive experiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses a significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current state-of-the-art models. The full benchmark is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ze1025/MORALISE.



### Physics-Driven Local-Whole Elastic Deformation Modeling for Point Cloud Representation Learning

- **Summary**: Existing point cloud representation learning tend to learning the geometric distribution of objects through data-driven approaches, emphasizing structural features while overlooking the relationship between the local information and the whole structure. Local features reflect the fine-grained variations of an object, while the whole structure is determined by the interaction and combination of these local features, collectively defining the object's shape. In real-world, objects undergo elastic deformation under external forces, and this deformation gradually affects the whole structure through the propagation of forces from local regions, thereby altering the object's geometric properties. Inspired by this, we propose a physics-driven self-supervised learning method for point cloud representation, which captures the relationship between parts and the whole by constructing a local-whole force propagation mechanism. Specifically, we employ a dual-task encoder-decoder framework, integrating the geometric modeling capability of implicit fields with physics-driven elastic deformation. The encoder extracts features from the point cloud and its tetrahedral mesh representation, capturing both geometric and physical properties. These features are then fed into two decoders: one learns the whole geometric shape of the point cloud through an implicit field, while the other predicts local deformations using two specifically designed physics information loss functions, modeling the deformation relationship between local and whole shapes. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches in object classification, few-shot learning, and segmentation, demonstrating its effectiveness.



### FlashKAT: Understanding and Addressing Performance Bottlenecks in the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer

- **Summary**: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has been gaining popularity as an alternative to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with its increased expressiveness and interpretability. However, the KAN can be orders of magnitude slower due to its increased computational cost and training instability, limiting its applicability to larger-scale tasks. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) has been proposed, which can achieve FLOPs similar to the traditional Transformer with MLPs by leveraging Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN). Unfortunately, despite the comparable FLOPs, our characterizations reveal that the KAT is still 123x slower in training speeds, indicating that there are other performance bottlenecks beyond FLOPs. In this paper, we conduct a series of experiments to understand the root cause of the slowdown in KAT. We uncover that the slowdown can be isolated to memory stalls and, more specifically, in the backward pass of GR-KAN caused by inefficient gradient accumulation. To address this memory bottleneck, we propose FlashKAT, which builds on our restructured kernel that minimizes gradient accumulation with atomic adds and accesses to slow memory. Evaluations demonstrate that FlashKAT can achieve a training speedup of 86.5x compared with the state-of-the-art KAT, while reducing rounding errors in the coefficient gradients.

- **Summary**: Occupancy Grid Maps are widely used in navigation for their ability to represent 3D space occupancy. However, existing methods that utilize multi-view cameras to construct Occupancy Networks for perception modeling suffer from cubic growth in data complexity. Adopting a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) perspective offers a more practical solution for autonomous driving, as it provides higher semantic density and mitigates complex object occlusions. Nonetheless, BEV-based approaches still require extensive engineering optimizations to enable efficient large-scale global modeling. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceBEV, the first method to introduce instance-level dimensionality reduction for BEV, enabling global modeling with transformers without relying on sparsification or acceleration operators. Different from other BEV methods, our approach directly employs transformers to aggregate global features. Compared to 3D object detection models, our method samples global feature maps into 3D space. Experiments on OpenOcc-NuScenes dataset show that InstanceBEV achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a simple, efficient framework without requiring additional optimizations.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of tasks, yet concerns about their potential biases exist. This work investigates the extent to which prominent VLMs exhibit cultural biases by evaluating their performance on an image-based country identification task at a country level. Utilizing the geographically diverse Country211 dataset, we probe several large vision language models (VLMs) under various prompting strategies: open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions (MCQs) including challenging setups like multilingual and adversarial settings. Our analysis aims to uncover disparities in model accuracy across different countries and question formats, providing insights into how training data distribution and evaluation methodologies might influence cultural biases in VLMs. The findings highlight significant variations in performance, suggesting that while VLMs possess considerable visual understanding, they inherit biases from their pre-training data and scale that impact their ability to generalize uniformly across diverse global contexts.

- **Summary**: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, resulting in limited targeted treatment options. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is the standard treatment for early-stage TNBC, with pathologic complete response (pCR) serving as a key prognostic marker; however, only 40-50% of patients with TNBC achieve pCR. Accurate prediction of NACT response is crucial to optimize therapy, avoid ineffective treatments, and improve patient outcomes. In this study, we developed a deep learning model to predict NACT response using pre-treatment hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy images. Our model achieved promising results in five-fold cross-validation (accuracy: 82%, AUC: 0.86, F1-score: 0.84, sensitivity: 0.85, specificity: 0.81, precision: 0.80). Analysis of model attention maps in conjunction with multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data revealed that regions of high predictive importance consistently colocalized with tumor areas showing elevated PD-L1 expression, CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and CD163+ macrophage density - all established biomarkers of treatment response. Our findings indicate that incorporating IHC-derived immune profiling data could substantially improve model interpretability and predictive performance. Furthermore, this approach may accelerate the discovery of novel histopathological biomarkers for NACT and advance the development of personalized treatment strategies for TNBC patients.



### MGStream: Motion-aware 3D Gaussian for Streamable Dynamic Scene Reconstruction

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention in streamable dynamic novel view synthesis (DNVS) for its photorealistic rendering capability and computational efficiency. Despite much progress in improving rendering quality and optimization strategies, 3DGS-based streamable dynamic scene reconstruction still suffers from flickering artifacts and storage inefficiency, and struggles to model the emerging objects. To tackle this, we introduce MGStream which employs the motion-related 3D Gaussians (3DGs) to reconstruct the dynamic and the vanilla 3DGs for the static. The motion-related 3DGs are implemented according to the motion mask and the clustering-based convex hull algorithm. The rigid deformation is applied to the motion-related 3DGs for modeling the dynamic, and the attention-based optimization on the motion-related 3DGs enables the reconstruction of the emerging objects. As the deformation and optimization are only conducted on the motion-related 3DGs, MGStream avoids flickering artifacts and improves the storage efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets N3DV and MeetRoom demonstrate that MGStream surpasses existing streaming 3DGS-based approaches in terms of rendering quality, training/storage efficiency and temporal consistency.

- **Summary**: This paper explores how the image quality assessment (IQA) task affects the cognitive processes of people from the perspective of pupil size and studies the relationship between pupil size and image quality. Specifically, we first invited subjects to participate in a subjective experiment, which includes two tasks: free observation and IQA. In the free observation task, subjects did not need to perform any action, and they only needed to observe images as they usually do with an album. In the IQA task, subjects were required to score images according to their overall impression of image quality. Then, by analyzing the difference in pupil size between the two tasks, we find that people may activate the visual attention mechanism when evaluating image quality. Meanwhile, we also find that the change in pupil size is closely related to image quality in the IQA task. For future research on IQA, this research can not only provide a theoretical basis for the objective IQA method and promote the development of more effective objective IQA methods, but also provide a new subjective IQA method for collecting the authentic subjective impression of image quality.

- **Summary**: Vectorized HD map is essential for autonomous driving. Remarkable work has been achieved in recent years, but there are still major issues: (1) in the generation of the BEV features, single modality-based methods are of limited perception capability, while direct concatenation-based multi-modal methods fail to capture synergies and disparities between different modalities, resulting in limited ranges with feature holes; (2) in the classification and localization of map elements, only point information is used without the consideration of element infor-mation and neglects the interaction between point information and element information, leading to erroneous shapes and element entanglement with low accuracy. To address above issues, we introduce SuperMapNet for long-range and high-accuracy vectorized HD map construction. It uses both camera images and LiDAR point clouds as input, and first tightly couple semantic information from camera images and geometric information from LiDAR point clouds by a cross-attention based synergy enhancement module and a flow-based disparity alignment module for long-range BEV feature generation. And then, local features from point queries and global features from element queries are tightly coupled by three-level interactions for high-accuracy classification and localization, where Point2Point interaction learns local geometric information between points of the same element and of each point, Element2Element interaction learns relation constraints between different elements and semantic information of each elements, and Point2Element interaction learns complement element information for its constituent points. Experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate superior performances, surpassing SOTAs over 14.9/8.8 mAP and 18.5/3.1 mAP under hard/easy settings, respectively. The code is made publicly available1.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multi-modal tasks by effectively aligning visual and textual representations. However, most video understanding VLM research has been domain-agnostic, leaving the understanding of their transfer learning capability to specialized domains under-explored. In this work, we address this by exploring the adaptability of open-source VLMs to specific domains, and focusing on soccer as an initial case study. Our approach uses large-scale soccer datasets and LLM to create instruction-following data, and use them to iteratively fine-tune the general-domain VLM in a curriculum learning fashion (first teaching the model key soccer concepts to then question answering tasks). The final adapted model, trained using a curated dataset of 20k video clips, exhibits significant improvement in soccer-specific tasks compared to the base model, with a 37.5% relative improvement for the visual question-answering task and an accuracy improvement from 11.8% to 63.5% for the downstream soccer action classification task.

- **Summary**: The ThinPrep Cytologic Test (TCT) is the most widely used method for cervical cancer screening, and the sample quality directly impacts the accuracy of the diagnosis. Traditional manual evaluation methods rely on the observation of pathologist under microscopes. These methods exhibit high subjectivity, high cost, long duration, and low reliability. With the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), an automated quality assessment system that performs at the level of a professional pathologist is necessary. To address this need, we propose a fully automated quality assessment method for Cervical Cytopathology Whole Slide Images (WSIs) based on The Bethesda System (TBS) diagnostic standards, artificial intelligence algorithms, and the characteristics of clinical data. The method analysis the context of WSIs to quantify quality evaluation metrics which are focused by TBS such as staining quality, cell counts and cell mass proportion through multiple models including object detection, classification and segmentation. Subsequently, the XGBoost model is used to mine the attention paid by pathologists to different quality evaluation metrics when evaluating samples, thereby obtaining a comprehensive WSI sample score calculation model. Experimental results on 100 WSIs demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method has significant advantages in terms of speed and consistency.

- **Summary**: A comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes is essential for autonomous vehicles (AVs), and among various perception tasks, occupancy estimation plays a central role by providing a general representation of drivable and occupied space. However, most existing occupancy estimation methods rely on LiDAR or cameras, which perform poorly in degraded environments such as smoke, rain, snow, and fog. In this paper, we propose 4D-ROLLS, the first weakly supervised occupancy estimation method for 4D radar using the LiDAR point cloud as the supervisory signal. Specifically, we introduce a method for generating pseudo-LiDAR labels, including occupancy queries and LiDAR height maps, as multi-stage supervision to train the 4D radar occupancy estimation model. Then the model is aligned with the occupancy map produced by LiDAR, fine-tuning its accuracy in occupancy estimation. Extensive comparative experiments validate the exceptional performance of 4D-ROLLS. Its robustness in degraded environments and effectiveness in cross-dataset training are qualitatively demonstrated. The model is also seamlessly transferred to downstream tasks BEV segmentation and point cloud occupancy prediction, highlighting its potential for broader applications. The lightweight network enables 4D-ROLLS model to achieve fast inference speeds at about 30 Hz on a 4060 GPU. The code of 4D-ROLLS will be made available at https://github.com/CLASS-Lab/4D-ROLLS.

- **Summary**: A common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease requires a precise diagnosis and efficient treatment, particularly in light of escalating healthcare expenses and the expanding use of artificial intelligence in medical diagnostics. Many recent studies shows that the combination of brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and deep neural networks have achieved promising results for diagnosing AD. Using deep convolutional neural networks, this paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture that incorporates multiresidual blocks, specialized spatial attention blocks, grouped query attention, and multi-head attention. The study assessed the model's performance on four publicly accessible datasets and concentrated on identifying binary and multiclass issues across various categories. This paper also takes into account of the explainability of AD's progression and compared with state-of-the-art methods namely Gradient Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM), Score-CAM, Faster Score-CAM, and XGRADCAM. Our methodology consistently outperforms current approaches, achieving 99.66\% accuracy in 4-class classification, 99.63\% in 3-class classification, and 100\% in binary classification using Kaggle datasets. For Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) datasets the accuracies are 99.92\%, 99.90\%, and 99.95\% respectively. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) dataset was used for experiments in three planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) and a combination of all planes. The study achieved accuracies of 99.08\% for axis, 99.85\% for sagittal, 99.5\% for coronal, and 99.17\% for all axis, and 97.79\% and 8.60\% respectively for ADNI-2. The network's ability to retrieve important information from MRI images is demonstrated by its excellent accuracy in categorizing AD stages.

- **Summary**: Pulmonary segment segmentation is crucial for cancer localization and surgical planning. However, the pixel-wise annotation of pulmonary segments is laborious, as the boundaries between segments are indistinguishable in medical images. To this end, we propose a weakly supervised learning (WSL) method, termed Anatomy-Hierarchy Supervised Learning (AHSL), which consults the precise clinical anatomical definition of pulmonary segments to perform pulmonary segment segmentation. Since pulmonary segments reside within the lobes and are determined by the bronchovascular tree, i.e., artery, airway and vein, the design of the loss function is founded on two principles. First, segment-level labels are utilized to directly supervise the output of the pulmonary segments, ensuring that they accurately encompass the appropriate bronchovascular tree. Second, lobe-level supervision indirectly oversees the pulmonary segment, ensuring their inclusion within the corresponding lobe. Besides, we introduce a two-stage segmentation strategy that incorporates bronchovascular priori information. Furthermore, a consistency loss is proposed to enhance the smoothness of segment boundaries, along with an evaluation metric designed to measure the smoothness of pulmonary segment boundaries. Visual inspection and evaluation metrics from experiments conducted on a private dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound imaging is widely applied in clinical practice, yet ultrasound videos often suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited resolutions, posing challenges for diagnosis and analysis. Variations in equipment and acquisition settings can further exacerbate differences in data distribution and noise levels, reducing the generalizability of pre-trained models. This work presents a self-supervised ultrasound video super-resolution algorithm called Deep Ultrasound Prior (DUP). DUP employs a video-adaptive optimization process of a neural network that enhances the resolution of given ultrasound videos without requiring paired training data while simultaneously removing noise. Quantitative and visual evaluations demonstrate that DUP outperforms existing super-resolution algorithms, leading to substantial improvements for downstream applications.

- **Summary**: Food recognition systems has advanced significantly for Western cuisines, yet its application to African foods remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by evaluating both deep learning and traditional machine learning methods for African food classification. We compared the performance of a fine-tuned ResNet50 model with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset comprises 1,658 images across six selected food categories that are known in Africa. To assess model effectiveness, we utilize five key evaluation metrics: Confusion matrix, F1-score, accuracy, recall and precision. Our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of both approaches, contributing to the advancement of food recognition for African cuisines.

- **Summary**: Long videos contain a vast amount of information, making video-text retrieval an essential and challenging task in multimodal learning. However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research. We release the code and dataset link at https://github.com/TechNomad-ds/LoVR-benchmark

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on Urdu newspapers. In our approach, we address the unique challenges of complex multi-column layouts, low-resolution archival scans, and diverse font styles. Our process decomposes the OCR task into four key modules: (1) article segmentation, (2) image super-resolution, (3) column segmentation, and (4) text recognition. For article segmentation, we fine-tune and evaluate YOLOv11x to identify and separate individual articles from cluttered layouts. Our model achieves a precision of 0.963 and mAP@50 of 0.975. For super-resolution, we fine-tune and benchmark the SwinIR model (reaching 32.71 dB PSNR) to enhance the quality of degraded newspaper scans. To do our column segmentation, we use YOLOv11x to separate columns in text to further enhance performance - this model reaches a precision of 0.970 and mAP@50 of 0.975. In the text recognition stage, we benchmark a range of LLMs from different families, including Gemini, GPT, Llama, and Claude. The lowest WER of 0.133 is achieved by Gemini-2.5-Pro.

- **Summary**: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)-based tuning has shifted the trajectory of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly following the introduction of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, directly applying it to medical tasks remains challenging for achieving clinically grounded model behavior. Motivated by the need to align model response with clinical expectations, we investigate four critical dimensions that affect the effectiveness of RL-based tuning in medical visual question answering (VQA): base model initialization strategy, the role of medical semantic alignment, the impact of length-based rewards on long-chain reasoning, and the influence of bias. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze these factors for medical MLLMs, providing new insights into how models are domain-specifically fine-tuned. Additionally, our results also demonstrate that GRPO-based RL tuning consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both accuracy and reasoning quality.

- **Summary**: Video Class-Incremental Learning (VCIL) seeks to develop models that continuously learn new action categories over time without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Unlike traditional Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), VCIL introduces the added complexity of spatiotemporal structures, making it particularly challenging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while effectively capturing both frame-shared semantics and temporal dynamics. Existing approaches either rely on exemplar rehearsal, raising concerns over memory and privacy, or adapt static image-based methods that neglect temporal modeling. To address these limitations, we propose Spatiotemporal Preservation and Routing (StPR), a unified and exemplar-free VCIL framework that explicitly disentangles and preserves spatiotemporal information. First, we introduce Frame-Shared Semantics Distillation (FSSD), which identifies semantically stable and meaningful channels by jointly considering semantic sensitivity and classification contribution. These important semantic channels are selectively regularized to maintain prior knowledge while allowing for adaptation. Second, we design a Temporal Decomposition-based Mixture-of-Experts (TD-MoE), which dynamically routes task-specific experts based on their temporal dynamics, enabling inference without task ID or stored exemplars. Together, StPR effectively leverages spatial semantics and temporal dynamics, achieving a unified, exemplar-free VCIL framework. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics400 show that our method outperforms existing baselines while offering improved interpretability and efficiency in VCIL.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a multi-label stereo matching method to simultaneously estimate the depth of the transparent objects and the occluded background in transparent scenes.Unlike previous methods that assume a unimodal distribution along the disparity dimension and formulate the matching as a single-label regression problem, we propose a multi-label regression formulation to estimate multiple depth values at the same pixel in transparent scenes. To resolve the multi-label regression problem, we introduce a pixel-wise multivariate Gaussian representation, where the mean vector encodes multiple depth values at the same pixel, and the covariance matrix determines whether a multi-label representation is necessary for a given pixel. The representation is iteratively predicted within a GRU framework. In each iteration, we first predict the update step for the mean parameters and then use both the update step and the updated mean parameters to estimate the covariance matrix. We also synthesize a dataset containing 10 scenes and 89 objects to validate the performance of transparent scene depth estimation. The experiments show that our method greatly improves the performance on transparent surfaces while preserving the background information for scene reconstruction.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an efficient visual transformer framework for ultra-high-definition (UHD) image dehazing that addresses the key challenges of slow training speed and high memory consumption for existing methods. Our approach introduces two key innovations: 1) an \textbf{a}daptive \textbf{n}ormalization mechanism inspired by the nGPT architecture that enables ultra-fast and stable training with a network with a restricted range of parameter expressions; and 2) we devise an atmospheric scattering-aware KV caching mechanism that dynamically optimizes feature preservation based on the physical haze formation model. The proposed architecture improves the training convergence speed by \textbf{5 $\times$} while reducing memory overhead, enabling real-time processing of 50 high-resolution images per second on an RTX4090 GPU. Experimental results show that our approach maintains state-of-the-art dehazing quality while significantly improving computational efficiency for 4K/8K image restoration tasks. Furthermore, we provide a new dehazing image interpretable method with the help of an integrated gradient attribution map.

- **Summary**: Recent efforts have explored multimodal semantic segmentation using various backbone architectures. However, while most methods aim to improve accuracy, their computational efficiency remains underexplored. To address this, we propose EGFormer, an efficient multimodal semantic segmentation framework that flexibly integrates an arbitrary number of modalities while significantly reducing model parameters and inference time without sacrificing performance. Our framework introduces two novel modules. First, the Any-modal Scoring Module (ASM) assigns importance scores to each modality independently, enabling dynamic ranking based on their feature maps. Second, the Modal Dropping Module (MDM) filters out less informative modalities at each stage, selectively preserving and aggregating only the most valuable features. This design allows the model to leverage useful information from all available modalities while discarding redundancy, thus ensuring high segmentation quality. In addition to efficiency, we evaluate EGFormer on a synthetic-to-real transfer task to demonstrate its generalizability. Extensive experiments show that EGFormer achieves competitive performance with up to 88 percent reduction in parameters and 50 percent fewer GFLOPs. Under unsupervised domain adaptation settings, it further achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Surface-based cortical analysis is valuable for a variety of neuroimaging tasks, such as spatial normalization, parcellation, and gray matter (GM) thickness estimation. However, most tools for estimating cortical surfaces work exclusively on scans with at least 1 mm isotropic resolution and are tuned to a specific magnetic resonance (MR) contrast, often T1-weighted (T1w). This precludes application using most clinical MR scans, which are very heterogeneous in terms of contrast and resolution. Here, we use synthetic domain-randomized data to train the first neural network for explicit estimation of cortical surfaces from scans of any contrast and resolution, without retraining. Our method deforms a template mesh to the white matter (WM) surface, which guarantees topological correctness. This mesh is further deformed to estimate the GM surface. We compare our method to recon-all-clinical (RAC), an implicit surface reconstruction method which is currently the only other tool capable of processing heterogeneous clinical MR scans, on ADNI and a large clinical dataset (n=1,332). We show a approximately 50 % reduction in cortical thickness error (from 0.50 to 0.24 mm) with respect to RAC and better recovery of the aging-related cortical thinning patterns detected by FreeSurfer on high-resolution T1w scans. Our method enables fast and accurate surface reconstruction of clinical scans, allowing studies (1) with sample sizes far beyond what is feasible in a research setting, and (2) of clinical populations that are difficult to enroll in research studies.

- **Summary**: Although adversarial training is known to be effective against adversarial examples, training dynamics are not well understood. In this study, we present the first theoretical analysis of adversarial training in random deep neural networks without any assumptions on data distributions. We introduce a new theoretical framework based on mean field theory, which addresses the limitations of existing mean field-based approaches. Based on this framework, we derive (empirically tight) upper bounds of $\ell_q$ norm-based adversarial loss with $\ell_p$ norm-based adversarial examples for various values of $p$ and $q$. Moreover, we prove that networks without shortcuts are generally not adversarially trainable and that adversarial training reduces network capacity. We also show that network width alleviates these issues. Furthermore, we present the various impacts of the input and output dimensions on the upper bounds and time evolution of the weight variance.

- **Summary**: Multi-scale deformable attention (MSDA) is a flexible and powerful feature extraction mechanism for visual tasks, but its random-access grid sampling strategy poses significant optimization challenges, especially on domain-specific accelerators such as NPUs. In this work, we present a co-design approach that systematically rethinks memory access and computation strategies for MSDA on the Ascend NPU architecture. With this co-design approach, our implementation supports both efficient forward and backward computation, is fully adapted for training workloads, and incorporates a suite of hardware-aware optimizations. Extensive experiments show that our solution achieves up to $5.9\times$ (forward), $8.9\times$ (backward), and $7.3\times$ (end-to-end training) speedup over the grid sample-based baseline, and $1.9\times$, $2.4\times$, and $2.0\times$ acceleration over the latest vendor library, respectively.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce OmniStyle-1M, a large-scale paired style transfer dataset comprising over one million content-style-stylized image triplets across 1,000 diverse style categories, each enhanced with textual descriptions and instruction prompts. We show that OmniStyle-1M can not only enable efficient and scalable of style transfer models through supervised training but also facilitate precise control over target stylization. Especially, to ensure the quality of the dataset, we introduce OmniFilter, a comprehensive style transfer quality assessment framework, which filters high-quality triplets based on content preservation, style consistency, and aesthetic appeal. Building upon this foundation, we propose OmniStyle, a framework based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture designed for high-quality and efficient style transfer. This framework supports both instruction-guided and image-guided style transfer, generating high resolution outputs with exceptional detail. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate OmniStyle's superior performance compared to existing approaches, highlighting its efficiency and versatility. OmniStyle-1M and its accompanying methodologies provide a significant contribution to advancing high-quality style transfer, offering a valuable resource for the research community.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has transformed computer vision for precision agriculture, yet apple orchard monitoring remains limited by dataset constraints. The lack of diverse, realistic datasets and the difficulty of annotating dense, heterogeneous scenes. Existing datasets overlook different growth stages and stereo imagery, both essential for realistic 3D modeling of orchards and tasks like fruit localization, yield estimation, and structural analysis. To address these gaps, we present AppleGrowthVision, a large-scale dataset comprising two subsets. The first includes 9,317 high resolution stereo images collected from a farm in Brandenburg (Germany), covering six agriculturally validated growth stages over a full growth cycle. The second subset consists of 1,125 densely annotated images from the same farm in Brandenburg and one in Pillnitz (Germany), containing a total of 31,084 apple labels. AppleGrowthVision provides stereo-image data with agriculturally validated growth stages, enabling precise phenological analysis and 3D reconstructions. Extending MinneApple with our data improves YOLOv8 performance by 7.69 % in terms of F1-score, while adding it to MinneApple and MAD boosts Faster R-CNN F1-score by 31.06 %. Additionally, six BBCH stages were predicted with over 95 % accuracy using VGG16, ResNet152, DenseNet201, and MobileNetv2. AppleGrowthVision bridges the gap between agricultural science and computer vision, by enabling the development of robust models for fruit detection, growth modeling, and 3D analysis in precision agriculture. Future work includes improving annotation, enhancing 3D reconstruction, and extending multimodal analysis across all growth stages.

- **Summary**: Adversarial training is one of the most effective adversarial defenses, but it incurs a high computational cost. In this study, we show that transformers adversarially pretrained on diverse tasks can serve as robust foundation models and eliminate the need for adversarial training in downstream tasks. Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that through in-context learning, a single adversarially pretrained transformer can robustly generalize to multiple unseen tasks without any additional training, i.e., without any parameter updates. This robustness stems from the model's focus on robust features and its resistance to attacks that exploit non-predictive features. Besides these positive findings, we also identify several limitations. Under certain conditions (though unrealistic), no universally robust single-layer transformers exist. Moreover, robust transformers exhibit an accuracy--robustness trade-off and require a large number of in-context demonstrations. The code is available at https://github.com/s-kumano/universally-robust-in-context-learner.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Target detection in high-resolution remote sensing imagery faces challenges due to the low recognition accuracy of small targets and high computational costs. The computational complexity of the Transformer architecture increases quadratically with image resolution, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures are forced to stack deeper convolutional layers to expand their receptive fields, leading to an explosive growth in computational demands. To address these computational constraints, we leverage Mamba's linear complexity for efficiency. However, Mamba's performance declines for small targets, primarily because small targets occupy a limited area in the image and have limited semantic information. Accurate identification of these small targets necessitates not only Mamba's global attention capabilities but also the precise capture of fine local details. To this end, we enhance Mamba by developing the Enhanced Small Target Detection (ESTD) module and the Convolutional Attention Residual Gate (CARG) module. The ESTD module bolsters local attention to capture fine-grained details, while the CARG module, built upon Mamba, emphasizes spatial and channel-wise information, collectively improving the model's ability to capture distinctive representations of small targets. Additionally, to highlight the semantic representation of small targets, we design a Mask Enhanced Pixel-level Fusion (MEPF) module for multispectral fusion, which enhances target features by effectively fusing visible and infrared multimodal information.



### Learning Concept-Driven Logical Rules for Interpretable and Generalizable Medical Image Classification

- **Summary**: The pursuit of decision safety in clinical applications highlights the potential of concept-based methods in medical imaging. While these models offer active interpretability, they often suffer from concept leakages, where unintended information within soft concept representations undermines both interpretability and generalizability. Moreover, most concept-based models focus solely on local explanations (instance-level), neglecting the global decision logic (dataset-level). To address these limitations, we propose Concept Rule Learner (CRL), a novel framework to learn Boolean logical rules from binarized visual concepts.

- **Summary**: Document image parsing is challenging due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Current approaches either assemble specialized expert models or directly generate page-level content autoregressively, facing integration overhead, efficiency bottlenecks, and layout structure degradation despite their decent performance. To address these limitations, we present \textit{Dolphin} (\textit{\textbf{Do}cument Image \textbf{P}arsing via \textbf{H}eterogeneous Anchor Prompt\textbf{in}g}), a novel multimodal document image parsing model following an analyze-then-parse paradigm. In the first stage, Dolphin generates a sequence of layout elements in reading order. These heterogeneous elements, serving as anchors and coupled with task-specific prompts, are fed back to Dolphin for parallel content parsing in the second stage. To train Dolphin, we construct a large-scale dataset of over 30 million samples, covering multi-granularity parsing tasks. Through comprehensive evaluations on both prevalent benchmarks and self-constructed ones, Dolphin achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse page-level and element-level settings, while ensuring superior efficiency through its lightweight architecture and parallel parsing mechanism. The code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/ByteDance/Dolphin

- **Summary**: Vision Mamba has recently emerged as a promising alternative to Transformer-based architectures, offering linear complexity in sequence length while maintaining strong modeling capacity. However, its adaptation to visual inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse. Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points. Extensive experiments on image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and change detection demonstrate that FractalMamba++ consistently outperforms previous Mamba-based backbones, particularly under high-resolution settings.

- **Summary**: In many real-world applications, deployed models encounter inputs that differ from the data seen during training. Out-of-distribution detection identifies whether an input stems from an unseen distribution, while open-world recognition flags such inputs to ensure the system remains robust as ever-emerging, previously $unknown$ categories appear and must be addressed without retraining. Foundation and vision-language models are pre-trained on large and diverse datasets with the expectation of broad generalization across domains, including medical imaging. However, benchmarking these models on test sets with only a few common outlier types silently collapses the evaluation back to a closed-set problem, masking failures on rare or truly novel conditions encountered in clinical use.   We therefore present $NOVA$, a challenging, real-life $evaluation-only$ benchmark of $\sim$900 brain MRI scans that span 281 rare pathologies and heterogeneous acquisition protocols. Each case includes rich clinical narratives and double-blinded expert bounding-box annotations. Together, these enable joint assessment of anomaly localisation, visual captioning, and diagnostic reasoning. Because NOVA is never used for training, it serves as an $extreme$ stress-test of out-of-distribution generalisation: models must bridge a distribution gap both in sample appearance and in semantic space. Baseline results with leading vision-language models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL-72B) reveal substantial performance drops across all tasks, establishing NOVA as a rigorous testbed for advancing models that can detect, localize, and reason about truly unknown anomalies.

- **Summary**: Place recognition is a cornerstone of vehicle navigation and mapping, which is pivotal in enabling systems to determine whether a location has been previously visited. This capability is critical for tasks such as loop closure in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and long-term navigation under varying environmental conditions. In this survey, we comprehensively review recent advancements in place recognition, emphasizing three representative methodological paradigms: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches, Transformer-based frameworks, and cross-modal strategies. We begin by elucidating the significance of place recognition within the broader context of autonomous systems. Subsequently, we trace the evolution of CNN-based methods, highlighting their contributions to robust visual descriptor learning and scalability in large-scale environments. We then examine the emerging class of Transformer-based models, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies and offer improved generalization across diverse scenes. Furthermore, we discuss cross-modal approaches that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as Lidar, vision, and text description, thereby enhancing resilience to viewpoint, illumination, and seasonal variations. We also summarize standard datasets and evaluation metrics widely adopted in the literature. Finally, we identify current research challenges and outline prospective directions, including domain adaptation, real-time performance, and lifelong learning, to inspire future advancements in this domain. The unified framework of leading-edge place recognition methods, i.e., code library, and the results of their experimental evaluations are available at https://github.com/CV4RA/SOTA-Place-Recognitioner.

- **Summary**: Steering methods have emerged as effective and targeted tools for guiding large language models' (LLMs) behavior without modifying their parameters. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), however, do not currently enjoy the same suite of techniques, due in part to their recency and architectural diversity. Inspired by this gap, we investigate whether MLLMs can be steered using vectors derived from their text-only LLM backbone, via sparse autoencoders (SAEs), mean shift, and linear probing. We find that text-derived steering consistently enhances multimodal accuracy across diverse MLLM architectures and visual tasks. In particular, mean shift boosts spatial relationship accuracy on CV-Bench by up to +7.3% and counting accuracy by up to +3.3%, outperforming prompting and exhibiting strong generalization to out-of-distribution datasets. These results highlight textual steering vectors as a powerful, efficient mechanism for enhancing grounding in MLLMs with minimal additional data collection and computational overhead.

- **Summary**: Generating large-scale multi-character interactions is a challenging and important task in character animation. Multi-character interactions involve not only natural interactive motions but also characters coordinated with each other for transition. For example, a dance scenario involves characters dancing with partners and also characters coordinated to new partners based on spatial and temporal observations. We term such transitions as coordinated interactions and decompose them into interaction synthesis and transition planning. Previous methods of single-character animation do not consider interactions that are critical for multiple characters. Deep-learning-based interaction synthesis usually focuses on two characters and does not consider transition planning. Optimization-based interaction synthesis relies on manually designing objective functions that may not generalize well. While crowd simulation involves more characters, their interactions are sparse and passive. We identify two challenges to multi-character interaction synthesis, including the lack of data and the planning of transitions among close and dense interactions. Existing datasets either do not have multiple characters or do not have close and dense interactions. The planning of transitions for multi-character close and dense interactions needs both spatial and temporal considerations. We propose a conditional generative pipeline comprising a coordinatable multi-character interaction space for interaction synthesis and a transition planning network for coordinations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline for multicharacter interaction synthesis and the applications facilitated by our method show the scalability and transferability.



### Generalizable Multispectral Land Cover Classification via Frequency-Aware Mixture of Low-Rank Token Experts

- **Summary**: We introduce Land-MoE, a novel approach for multispectral land cover classification (MLCC). Spectral shift, which emerges from disparities in sensors and geospatial conditions, poses a significant challenge in this domain. Existing methods predominantly rely on domain adaptation and generalization strategies, often utilizing small-scale models that exhibit limited performance. In contrast, Land-MoE addresses these issues by hierarchically inserting a Frequency-aware Mixture of Low-rank Token Experts, to fine-tune Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, Land-MoE comprises two key modules: the mixture of low-rank token experts (MoLTE) and frequency-aware filters (FAF). MoLTE leverages rank-differentiated tokens to generate diverse feature adjustments for individual instances within multispectral images. By dynamically combining learnable low-rank token experts of varying ranks, it enhances the robustness against spectral shifts. Meanwhile, FAF conducts frequency-domain modulation on the refined features. This process enables the model to effectively capture frequency band information that is strongly correlated with semantic essence, while simultaneously suppressing frequency noise irrelevant to the task. Comprehensive experiments on MLCC tasks involving cross-sensor and cross-geospatial setups demonstrate that Land-MoE outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Additionally, the proposed approach has also achieved state-of-the-art performance in domain generalization semantic segmentation tasks of RGB remote sensing images.



### Unlocking the Power of SAM 2 for Few-Shot Segmentation

- **Summary**: Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) aims to learn class-agnostic segmentation on few classes to segment arbitrary classes, but at the risk of overfitting. To address this, some methods use the well-learned knowledge of foundation models (e.g., SAM) to simplify the learning process. Recently, SAM 2 has extended SAM by supporting video segmentation, whose class-agnostic matching ability is useful to FSS. A simple idea is to encode support foreground (FG) features as memory, with which query FG features are matched and fused. Unfortunately, the FG objects in different frames of SAM 2's video data are always the same identity, while those in FSS are different identities, i.e., the matching step is incompatible. Therefore, we design Pseudo Prompt Generator to encode pseudo query memory, matching with query features in a compatible way. However, the memories can never be as accurate as the real ones, i.e., they are likely to contain incomplete query FG, and some unexpected query background (BG) features, leading to wrong segmentation. Hence, we further design Iterative Memory Refinement to fuse more query FG features into the memory, and devise a Support-Calibrated Memory Attention to suppress the unexpected query BG features in memory. Extensive experiments have been conducted on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ to validate the effectiveness of our design, e.g., the 1-shot mIoU can be 4.2% better than the best baseline.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional reconstruction of buildings, particularly at Level of Detail 1 (LOD1), plays a crucial role in various applications such as urban planning, urban environmental studies, and designing optimized transportation networks. This study focuses on assessing the potential of LiDAR data for accurate 3D building reconstruction at LOD1 and extracting morphological features from these models. Four deep semantic segmentation models, U-Net, Attention U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepLabV3+, were used, applying transfer learning to extract building footprints from LiDAR data. The results showed that U-Net3+ and Attention U-Net outperformed the others, achieving IoU scores of 0.833 and 0.814, respectively. Various statistical measures, including maximum, range, mode, median, and the 90th percentile, were used to estimate building heights, resulting in the generation of 3D models at LOD1. As the main contribution of the research, the impact of segmentation accuracy on the quality of 3D building modeling and the accuracy of morphological features like building area and external wall surface area was investigated. The results showed that the accuracy of building identification (segmentation performance) significantly affects the 3D model quality and the estimation of morphological features, depending on the height calculation method. Overall, the UNet3+ method, utilizing the 90th percentile and median measures, leads to accurate height estimation of buildings and the extraction of morphological features.

- **Summary**: Supervised pretrained models have become widely used in deep learning, especially for image segmentation tasks. However, when applied to specialized datasets such as biomedical imaging, pretrained weights often introduce unintended biases. These biases cause models to assign different levels of importance to different slices, leading to inconsistencies in feature utilization, which can be observed as asymmetries in saliency map distributions. This transfer of color distributions from natural images to non-natural datasets can compromise model performance and reduce the reliability of results. In this study, we investigate the effects of these biases and propose strategies to mitigate them. Through a series of experiments, we test both pretrained and randomly initialized models, comparing their performance and saliency map distributions. Our proposed methods, which aim to neutralize the bias introduced by pretrained color channel weights, demonstrate promising results, offering a practical approach to improving model explainability while maintaining the benefits of pretrained models. This publication presents our findings, providing insights into addressing pretrained weight biases across various deep learning tasks.

- **Summary**: Most machine learning-based image segmentation models produce pixel-wise confidence scores - typically derived from softmax outputs - that represent the model's predicted probability for each class label at every pixel. While this information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging, these (uncalibrated) scores are heuristic in nature and do not constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction (CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels, a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model capable of generating multiple sample outputs - such as those using dropout, Bayesian modeling, or ensembles. We evaluate CONSIGN against a standard pixel-wise CP approach across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty estimates.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a valuable technique for compressing large deep learning models into smaller, edge-suitable networks. However, conventional KD frameworks rely on pre-trained high-capacity teacher networks, which introduce significant challenges such as increased memory/storage requirements, additional training costs, and ambiguity in selecting an appropriate teacher for a given student model. Although a teacher-free distillation (self-distillation) has emerged as a promising alternative, many existing approaches still rely on architectural modifications or complex training procedures, which limit their generality and efficiency.   To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on teacher-free distillation that operates using a single student network without any auxiliary components, architectural modifications, or additional learnable parameters. Our approach is built on a simple yet highly effective augmentation, called intra-class patch swap augmentation. This augmentation simulates a teacher-student dynamic within a single model by generating pairs of intra-class samples with varying confidence levels, and then applying instance-to-instance distillation to align their predictive distributions. Our method is conceptually simple, model-agnostic, and easy to implement, requiring only a single augmentation function. Extensive experiments across image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection show that our method consistently outperforms both existing self-distillation baselines and conventional teacher-based KD approaches. These results suggest that the success of self-distillation could hinge on the design of the augmentation itself. Our codes are available at https://github.com/hchoi71/Intra-class-Patch-Swap.

- **Summary**: Intelligent game creation represents a transformative advancement in game development, utilizing generative artificial intelligence to dynamically generate and enhance game content. Despite notable progress in generative models, the comprehensive synthesis of high-quality game assets, including both images and videos, remains a challenging frontier. To create high-fidelity game content that simultaneously aligns with player preferences and significantly boosts designer efficiency, we present Hunyuan-Game, an innovative project designed to revolutionize intelligent game production. Hunyuan-Game encompasses two primary branches: image generation and video generation. The image generation component is built upon a vast dataset comprising billions of game images, leading to the development of a group of customized image generation models tailored for game scenarios: (1) General Text-to-Image Generation. (2) Game Visual Effects Generation, involving text-to-effect and reference image-based game visual effect generation. (3) Transparent Image Generation for characters, scenes, and game visual effects. (4) Game Character Generation based on sketches, black-and-white images, and white models. The video generation component is built upon a comprehensive dataset of millions of game and anime videos, leading to the development of five core algorithmic models, each targeting critical pain points in game development and having robust adaptation to diverse game video scenarios: (1) Image-to-Video Generation. (2) 360 A/T Pose Avatar Video Synthesis. (3) Dynamic Illustration Generation. (4) Generative Video Super-Resolution. (5) Interactive Game Video Generation. These image and video generation models not only exhibit high-level aesthetic expression but also deeply integrate domain-specific knowledge, establishing a systematic understanding of diverse game and anime art styles.

- **Summary**: Given the audio-visual clip of the speaker, facial reaction generation aims to predict the listener's facial reactions. The challenge lies in capturing the relevance between video and audio while balancing appropriateness, realism, and diversity. While prior works have mostly focused on uni-modal inputs or simplified reaction mappings, recent approaches such as PerFRDiff have explored multi-modal inputs and the one-to-many nature of appropriate reaction mappings. In this work, we propose the Facial Reaction Diffusion (ReactDiff) framework that uniquely integrates a Multi-Modality Transformer with conditional diffusion in the latent space for enhanced reaction generation. Unlike existing methods, ReactDiff leverages intra- and inter-class attention for fine-grained multi-modal interaction, while the latent diffusion process between the encoder and decoder enables diverse yet contextually appropriate outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that ReactDiff significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a facial reaction correlation of 0.26 and diversity score of 0.094 while maintaining competitive realism.

- **Summary**: Session search involves a series of interactive queries and actions to fulfill user's complex information need. Current strategies typically prioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the graph structure in interactions. While some approaches focus on capturing structural information, they use a generalized representation for documents, neglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic Graph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and graph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models (LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to convert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history, interaction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM. Moreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual corpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar, our objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a textual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic learning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and generative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological information from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and comprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm the superiority of our approach. Our paradigm also offers a novel and effective methodology that bridges the gap between traditional search strategies and modern LLMs.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation plays a great potential role in obstacle avoidance and navigation for further Mars exploration missions. Compared to traditional stereo matching, learning-based stereo depth estimation provides a data-driven approach to infer dense and precise depth maps from stereo image pairs. However, these methods always suffer performance degradation in environments with sparse textures and lacking geometric constraints, such as the unstructured terrain of Mars. To address these challenges, we propose M3Depth, a depth estimation model tailored for Mars rovers. Considering the sparse and smooth texture of Martian terrain, which is primarily composed of low-frequency features, our model incorporates a convolutional kernel based on wavelet transform that effectively captures low-frequency response and expands the receptive field. Additionally, we introduce a consistency loss that explicitly models the complementary relationship between depth map and surface normal map, utilizing the surface normal as a geometric constraint to enhance the accuracy of depth estimation. Besides, a pixel-wise refinement module with mutual boosting mechanism is designed to iteratively refine both depth and surface normal predictions. Experimental results on synthetic Mars datasets with depth annotations show that M3Depth achieves a significant 16% improvement in depth estimation accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods in depth estimation. Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong applicability in real-world Martian scenarios, offering a promising solution for future Mars exploration missions.

- **Summary**: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained diffusion transformer models have made significant progress in video generation. While current DiT models can produce high-definition, high-frame-rate, and highly diverse videos, there is a lack of fine-grained control over the video content. Controlling the motion of subjects in videos using only prompts is challenging, especially when it comes to describing complex movements. Further, existing methods fail to control the motion in image-to-video generation, as the subject in the reference image often differs from the subject in the reference video in terms of initial position, size, and shape. To address this, we propose the Leveraging Motion Prior (LMP) framework for zero-shot video generation. Our framework harnesses the powerful generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion transformers to enable motion in the generated videos to reference user-provided motion videos in both text-to-video and image-to-video generation. To this end, we first introduce a foreground-background disentangle module to distinguish between moving subjects and backgrounds in the reference video, preventing interference in the target video generation. A reweighted motion transfer module is designed to allow the target video to reference the motion from the reference video. To avoid interference from the subject in the reference video, we propose an appearance separation module to suppress the appearance of the reference subject in the target video. We annotate the DAVIS dataset with detailed prompts for our experiments and design evaluation metrics to validate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in generation quality, prompt-video consistency, and control capability.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of sampling distributions stemming from non-convex potentials with Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). We prove the stability of the discrete-time ULA to drift approximations under the assumption that the potential is strongly convex at infinity. In many context, e.g. imaging inverse problems, potentials are non-convex and non-smooth. Proximal Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm (PSGLA) is a popular algorithm to handle such potentials. It combines the forward-backward optimization algorithm with a ULA step. Our main stability result combined with properties of the Moreau envelope allows us to derive the first proof of convergence of the PSGLA for non-convex potentials. We empirically validate our methodology on synthetic data and in the context of imaging inverse problems. In particular, we observe that PSGLA exhibits faster convergence rates than Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm for posterior sampling while preserving its restoration properties.

- **Summary**: In the realm of information retrieval, users often engage in multi-turn interactions with search engines to acquire information, leading to the formation of sequences of user feedback behaviors. Leveraging the session context has proven to be beneficial for inferring user search intent and document ranking. A multitude of approaches have been proposed to exploit in-session context for improved document ranking. Despite these advances, the limitation of historical session data for capturing evolving user intent remains a challenge. In this work, we explore the integration of future contextual information into the session context to enhance document ranking. We present the siamese model optimization framework, comprising a history-conditioned model and a future-aware model. The former processes only the historical behavior sequence, while the latter integrates both historical and anticipated future behaviors. Both models are trained collaboratively using the supervised labels and pseudo labels predicted by the other. The history-conditioned model, referred to as ForeRanker, progressively learns future-relevant information to enhance ranking, while it singly uses historical session at inference time. To mitigate inconsistencies during training, we introduce the peer knowledge distillation method with a dynamic gating mechanism, allowing models to selectively incorporate contextual information. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our ForeRanker, showcasing its superior performance compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Omnidirectional images (ODIs), with their 360{\deg} field of view, provide unparalleled spatial awareness for immersive applications like augmented reality and embodied AI. However, the capability of existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend and reason about such panoramic scenes remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing OmniVQA, the first dataset and conducting the first benchmark for omnidirectional visual question answering. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant limitations in handling omnidirectional visual question answering, highlighting persistent challenges in object localization, feature extraction, and hallucination suppression within panoramic contexts. These results underscore the disconnect between current MLLM capabilities and the demands of omnidirectional visual understanding, which calls for dedicated architectural or training innovations tailored to 360{\deg} imagery. Building on the OmniVQA dataset and benchmark, we further introduce a rule-based reinforcement learning method, 360-R1, based on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct. Concretely, we modify the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by proposing three novel reward functions: (1) reasoning process similarity reward, (2) answer semantic accuracy reward, and (3) structured format compliance reward. Extensive experiments on our OmniVQA demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in omnidirectional space (+6% improvement).



### Beginning with You: Perceptual-Initialization Improves Vision-Language Representation and Alignment

- **Summary**: We introduce Perceptual-Initialization (PI), a paradigm shift in visual representation learning that incorporates human perceptual structure during the initialization phase rather than as a downstream fine-tuning step. By integrating human-derived triplet embeddings from the NIGHTS dataset to initialize a CLIP vision encoder, followed by self-supervised learning on YFCC15M, our approach demonstrates significant zero-shot performance improvements, without any task-specific fine-tuning, across 29 zero shot classification and 2 retrieval benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K, zero-shot gains emerge after approximately 15 epochs of pretraining. Benefits are observed across datasets of various scales, with improvements manifesting at different stages of the pretraining process depending on dataset characteristics. Our approach consistently enhances zero-shot top-1 accuracy, top-5 accuracy, and retrieval recall (e.g., R@1, R@5) across these diverse evaluation tasks, without requiring any adaptation to target domains. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom of using human-perceptual data primarily for fine-tuning and demonstrate that embedding human perceptual structure during early representation learning yields more capable and vision-language aligned systems that generalize immediately to unseen tasks. Our work shows that "beginning with you", starting with human perception, provides a stronger foundation for general-purpose vision-language intelligence.

- **Summary**: Chamfer Distance (CD) comprises two components that can evaluate the global distribution and local performance of generated point clouds, making it widely utilized as a similarity measure between generated and target point clouds in point cloud completion tasks. Additionally, CD's computational efficiency has led to its frequent application as an objective function for guiding point cloud generation. However, using CD directly as an objective function with fixed equal weights for its two components can often result in seemingly high overall performance (i.e., low CD score), while failing to achieve a good global distribution. This is typically reflected in high Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and Decomposed Chamfer Distance (DCD) scores, alongside poor human assessments. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible-Weighted Chamfer Distance (FCD) to guide point cloud generation. FCD assigns a higher weight to the global distribution component of CD and incorporates a flexible weighting strategy to adjust the balance between the two components, aiming to improve global distribution while maintaining robust overall performance. Experimental results on two state-of-the-art networks demonstrate that our method achieves superior results across multiple evaluation metrics, including CD, EMD, DCD, and F-Score, as well as in human evaluations.

- **Summary**: We propose Visual-only Question Answering (VoQA), a novel multimodal task in which questions are visually embedded within images, without any accompanying textual input. This requires models to locate, recognize, and reason over visually embedded textual questions, posing challenges for existing large vision-language models (LVLMs), which show notable performance drops even with carefully designed prompts. To bridge this gap, we introduce Guided Response Triggering Supervised Fine-tuning (GRT-SFT), a structured fine-tuning strategy that guides the model to perform step-by-step reasoning purely based on visual input, significantly improving model performance. Our work enhances models' capacity for human-like visual understanding in complex multimodal scenarios, where information, including language, is perceived visually.

- **Summary**: Traditional visual grounding methods primarily focus on single-image scenarios with simple textual references. However, extending these methods to real-world scenarios that involve implicit and complex instructions, particularly in conjunction with multiple images, poses significant challenges, which is mainly due to the lack of advanced reasoning ability across diverse multi-modal contexts. In this work, we aim to address the more practical universal grounding task, and propose UniVG-R1, a reasoning guided multimodal large language model (MLLM) for universal visual grounding, which enhances reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) combined with cold-start data. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) grounding dataset, annotated with detailed reasoning chains, to guide the model towards correct reasoning paths via supervised fine-tuning. Subsequently, we perform rule-based reinforcement learning to encourage the model to identify correct reasoning chains, thereby incentivizing its reasoning capabilities. In addition, we identify a difficulty bias arising from the prevalence of easy samples as RL training progresses, and we propose a difficulty-aware weight adjustment strategy to further strengthen the performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of UniVG-R1, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIG-Bench with a 9.1% improvement over the previous method. Furthermore, our model exhibits strong generalizability, achieving an average improvement of 23.4% in zero-shot performance across four image and video reasoning grounding benchmarks.

- **Summary**: This paper focus on few-shot object detection~(FSOD) and instance segmentation~(FSIS), which requires a model to quickly adapt to novel classes with a few labeled instances. The existing methods severely suffer from bias classification because of the missing label issue which naturally exists in an instance-level few-shot scenario and is first formally proposed by us. Our analysis suggests that the standard classification head of most FSOD or FSIS models needs to be decoupled to mitigate the bias classification. Therefore, we propose an embarrassingly simple but effective method that decouples the standard classifier into two heads. Then, these two individual heads are capable of independently addressing clear positive samples and noisy negative samples which are caused by the missing label. In this way, the model can effectively learn novel classes while mitigating the effects of noisy negative samples. Without bells and whistles, our model without any additional computation cost and parameters consistently outperforms its baseline and state-of-the-art by a large margin on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO benchmarks for FSOD and FSIS tasks.

- **Summary**: A key trend in Large Reasoning Models (e.g., OpenAI's o3) is the native agentic ability to use external tools such as web browsers for searching and writing/executing code for image manipulation to think with images. In the open-source research community, while significant progress has been made in language-only agentic abilities such as function calling and tool integration, the development of multi-modal agentic capabilities that involve truly thinking with images, and their corresponding benchmarks, are still less explored. This work highlights the effectiveness of Visual Agentic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-ARFT) for enabling flexible and adaptive reasoning abilities for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With Visual-ARFT, open-source LVLMs gain the ability to browse websites for real-time information updates and write code to manipulate and analyze input images through cropping, rotation, and other image processing techniques. We also present a Multi-modal Agentic Tool Bench (MAT) with two settings (MAT-Search and MAT-Coding) designed to evaluate LVLMs' agentic search and coding abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that Visual-ARFT outperforms its baseline by +18.6% F1 / +13.0% EM on MAT-Coding and +10.3% F1 / +8.7% EM on MAT-Search, ultimately surpassing GPT-4o. Visual-ARFT also achieves +29.3 F1% / +25.9% EM gains on existing multi-hop QA benchmarks such as 2Wiki and HotpotQA, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Our findings suggest that Visual-ARFT offers a promising path toward building robust and generalizable multimodal agents.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality image generation and editing. Many existing approaches rely on text prompts as editing guidance. However, these methods are constrained by the need for manual prompt crafting, which can be time-consuming, introduce irrelevant details, and significantly limit editing performance. In this work, we propose optimizing semantic embeddings guided by attribute classifiers to steer text-to-image models toward desired edits, without relying on text prompts or requiring any training or fine-tuning of the diffusion model. We utilize classifiers to learn precise semantic embeddings at the dataset level. The learned embeddings are theoretically justified as the optimal representation of attribute semantics, enabling disentangled and accurate edits. Experiments further demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of disentanglement and strong generalization across different domains of data.



### Aligning Attention Distribution to Information Flow for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Vision-Language Models

- **Summary**: Due to the unidirectional masking mechanism, Decoder-Only models propagate information from left to right. LVLMs (Large Vision-Language Models) follow the same architecture, with visual information gradually integrated into semantic representations during forward propagation. Through systematic analysis, we observe that over 80\% of the visual information is absorbed into the semantic representations. However, the model's attention still predominantly focuses on the visual representations. This misalignment between the attention distribution and the actual information flow undermines the model's visual understanding ability and contributes to hallucinations. To address this issue, we enhance the model's visual understanding by leveraging the core information embedded in semantic representations. Specifically, we identify attention heads that focus on core semantic representations based on their attention distributions. Then, through a two-stage optimization paradigm, we propagate the advantages of these attention heads across the entire model, aligning the attention distribution with the actual information flow. We evaluate our method on three image captioning benchmarks using five different LVLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly reducing hallucinations. Further experiments reveal a trade-off between reduced hallucinations and richer details. Notably, our method allows for manual adjustment of the model's conservativeness, enabling flexible control to meet diverse real-world requirements. Code will be released once accepted.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Multimodal Speculative Decoding (MSD) to accelerate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inference. Speculative decoding has been shown to accelerate Large Language Models (LLMs) without sacrificing accuracy. However, current speculative decoding methods for MLLMs fail to achieve the same speedup as they do for LLMs. To address this, we reimagine speculative decoding specifically for MLLMs. Our analysis of MLLM characteristics reveals two key design principles for MSD: (1) Text and visual tokens have fundamentally different characteristics and need to be processed separately during drafting. (2) Both language modeling ability and visual perception capability are crucial for the draft model. For the first principle, MSD decouples text and visual tokens in the draft model, allowing each to be handled based on its own characteristics. For the second principle, MSD uses a two-stage training strategy: In stage one, the draft model is trained on text-only instruction-tuning datasets to improve its language modeling ability. In stage two, MSD gradually introduces multimodal data to enhance the visual perception capability of the draft model. Experiments show that MSD boosts inference speed by up to $2.29\times$ for LLaVA-1.5-7B and up to $2.46\times$ for LLaVA-1.5-13B on multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Visuo-tactile perception aims to understand an object's tactile properties, such as texture, softness, and rigidity. However, the field remains underexplored because collecting tactile data is costly and labor-intensive. We observe that visually distinct objects can exhibit similar surface textures or material properties. For example, a leather sofa and a leather jacket have different appearances but share similar tactile properties. This implies that tactile understanding can be guided by material cues in visual data, even without direct tactile supervision. In this paper, we introduce RA-Touch, a retrieval-augmented framework that improves visuo-tactile perception by leveraging visual data enriched with tactile semantics. We carefully recaption a large-scale visual dataset with tactile-focused descriptions, enabling the model to access tactile semantics typically absent from conventional visual datasets. A key challenge remains in effectively utilizing these tactile-aware external descriptions. RA-Touch addresses this by retrieving visual-textual representations aligned with tactile inputs and integrating them to focus on relevant textural and material properties. By outperforming prior methods on the TVL benchmark, our method demonstrates the potential of retrieval-based visual reuse for tactile understanding.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the use of contrastive learning and generative adversarial networks for generating realistic underwater images from synthetic images with uniform lighting. We investigate the performance of image translation models for generating realistic underwater images using the VAROS dataset. Two key evaluation metrics, Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), provide insights into the trade-offs between perceptual quality and structural preservation. For paired image translation, pix2pix achieves the best FID scores due to its paired supervision and PatchGAN discriminator, while the autoencoder model attains the highest SSIM, suggesting better structural fidelity despite producing blurrier outputs. Among unpaired methods, CycleGAN achieves a competitive FID score by leveraging cycle-consistency loss, whereas CUT, which replaces cycle-consistency with contrastive learning, attains higher SSIM, indicating improved spatial similarity retention. Notably, incorporating depth information into CUT results in the lowest overall FID score, demonstrating that depth cues enhance realism. However, the slight decrease in SSIM suggests that depth-aware learning may introduce structural variations.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains, including radiology report generation. Previous approaches have attempted to utilize multimodal LLMs for this task, enhancing their performance through the integration of domain-specific knowledge retrieval. However, these approaches often overlook the knowledge already embedded within the LLMs, leading to redundant information integration and inefficient utilization of learned representations. To address this limitation, we propose RADAR, a framework for enhancing radiology report generation with supplementary knowledge injection. RADAR improves report generation by systematically leveraging both the internal knowledge of an LLM and externally retrieved information. Specifically, it first extracts the model's acquired knowledge that aligns with expert image-based classification outputs. It then retrieves relevant supplementary knowledge to further enrich this information. Finally, by aggregating both sources, RADAR generates more accurate and informative radiology reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert-Plus, and IU X-ray demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs in both language quality and clinical accuracy

- **Summary**: Tactile perception is profoundly influenced by the surface properties of objects in contact. However, despite their crucial role in shaping tactile experiences, these material characteristics have been largely neglected in existing tactile representation learning methods. Most approaches primarily focus on aligning tactile data with visual or textual information, overlooking the richness of tactile feedback that comes from understanding the materials' inherent properties. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting the tactile representation learning framework and incorporating material-aware priors into the learning process. These priors, which represent pre-learned characteristics specific to different materials, allow tactile models to better capture and generalize the nuances of surface texture. Our method enables more accurate, contextually rich tactile feedback across diverse materials and textures, improving performance in real-world applications such as robotics, haptic feedback systems, and material editing.

- **Summary**: Facial recognition technology (FRT) is increasingly used in criminal investigations, yet most evaluations of its accuracy rely on high-quality images, unlike those often encountered by law enforcement. This study examines how five common forms of image degradation--contrast, brightness, motion blur, pose shift, and resolution--affect FRT accuracy and fairness across demographic groups. Using synthetic faces generated by StyleGAN3 and labeled with FairFace, we simulate degraded images and evaluate performance using Deepface with ArcFace loss in 1:n identification tasks. We perform an experiment and find that false positive rates peak near baseline image quality, while false negatives increase as degradation intensifies--especially with blur and low resolution. Error rates are consistently higher for women and Black individuals, with Black females most affected. These disparities raise concerns about fairness and reliability when FRT is used in real-world investigative contexts. Nevertheless, even under the most challenging conditions and for the most affected subgroups, FRT accuracy remains substantially higher than that of many traditional forensic methods. This suggests that, if appropriately validated and regulated, FRT should be considered a valuable investigative tool. However, algorithmic accuracy alone is not sufficient: we must also evaluate how FRT is used in practice, including user-driven data manipulation. Such cases underscore the need for transparency and oversight in FRT deployment to ensure both fairness and forensic validity.

- **Summary**: Existing video understanding benchmarks often conflate knowledge-based and purely image-based questions, rather than clearly isolating a model's temporal reasoning ability, which is the key aspect that distinguishes video understanding from other modalities. We identify two major limitations that obscure whether higher scores truly indicate stronger understanding of the dynamic content in videos: (1) strong language priors, where models can answer questions without watching the video; and (2) shuffling invariance, where models maintain similar performance on certain questions even when video frames are temporally shuffled. To alleviate these issues, we propose VBenchComp, an automated pipeline that categorizes questions into different domains: LLM-Answerable, Semantic, and Temporal. Specifically, LLM-Answerable questions can be answered without viewing the video; Semantic questions remain answerable even when the video frames are shuffled; and Temporal questions require understanding the correct temporal order of frames. The rest of the questions are labeled as Others. This can enable fine-grained evaluation of different capabilities of a video LLM. Our analysis reveals nuanced model weaknesses that are hidden by traditional overall scores, and we offer insights and recommendations for designing future benchmarks that more accurately assess video LLMs.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a discriminator-free adversarial-based approach termed DDA-MLIC for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in the context of Multi-Label Image Classification (MLIC). While recent efforts have explored adversarial-based UDA methods for MLIC, they typically include an additional discriminator subnet. Nevertheless, decoupling the classification and the discrimination tasks may harm their task-specific discriminative power. Herein, we address this challenge by presenting a novel adversarial critic directly derived from the task-specific classifier. Specifically, we employ a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model both source and target predictions, distinguishing between two distinct clusters. Instead of using the traditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, our approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to estimate the parameters of each GMM component. Subsequently, the source and target GMM parameters are leveraged to formulate an adversarial loss using the Fr\'echet distance. The proposed framework is therefore not only fully differentiable but is also cost-effective as it avoids the expensive iterative process usually induced by the standard EM method. The proposed method is evaluated on several multi-label image datasets covering three different types of domain shift. The obtained results demonstrate that DDA-MLIC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision while requiring a lower number of parameters. The code is made publicly available at github.com/cvi2snt/DDA-MLIC.

- **Summary**: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) enhances robustness in noisy environments by integrating visual cues. While recent advances integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into AVSR, their high computational cost hinders deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Llama-SMoP, an efficient Multimodal LLM that employs a Sparse Mixture of Projectors (SMoP) module to scale model capacity without increasing inference costs. By incorporating sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) projectors, Llama-SMoP enables the use of smaller LLMs while maintaining strong performance. We explore three SMoP configurations and show that Llama-SMoP DEDR (Disjoint-Experts, Disjoint-Routers), which uses modality-specific routers and experts, achieves superior performance on ASR, VSR, and AVSR tasks. Ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in expert activation, scalability, and noise robustness.

- **Summary**: Plane geometry problem solving (PGPS) has recently gained significant attention as a benchmark to assess the multi-modal reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models. Despite the growing interest in PGPS, the research community still lacks a comprehensive overview that systematically synthesizes recent work in PGPS. To fill this gap, we present a survey of existing PGPS studies. We first categorize PGPS methods into an encoder-decoder framework and summarize the corresponding output formats used by their encoders and decoders. Subsequently, we classify and analyze these encoders and decoders according to their architectural designs. Finally, we outline major challenges and promising directions for future research. In particular, we discuss the hallucination issues arising during the encoding phase within encoder-decoder architectures, as well as the problem of data leakage in current PGPS benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Text-to-Image (T2I) has been prevalent in recent years, with most common condition tasks having been optimized nicely. Besides, counterfactual Text-to-Image is obstructing us from a more versatile AIGC experience. For those scenes that are impossible to happen in real world and anti-physics, we should spare no efforts in increasing the factual feel, which means synthesizing images that people think very likely to be happening, and concept alignment, which means all the required objects should be in the same frame. In this paper, we focus on concept alignment. As controllable T2I models have achieved satisfactory performance for real applications, we utilize this technology to replace the objects in a synthesized image in latent space step-by-step to change the image from a common scene to a counterfactual scene to meet the prompt. We propose a strategy to instruct this replacing process, which is called as Explicit Logical Narrative Prompt (ELNP), by using the newly SoTA language model DeepSeek to generate the instructions. Furthermore, to evaluate models' performance in counterfactual T2I, we design a metric to calculate how many required concepts in the prompt can be covered averagely in the synthesized images. The extensive experiments and qualitative comparisons demonstrate that our strategy can boost the concept alignment in counterfactual T2I.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel inertial localization framework named Egocentric Action-aware Inertial Localization (EAIL), which leverages egocentric action cues from head-mounted IMU signals to localize the target individual within a 3D point cloud. Human inertial localization is challenging due to IMU sensor noise that causes trajectory drift over time. The diversity of human actions further complicates IMU signal processing by introducing various motion patterns. Nevertheless, we observe that some actions observed through the head-mounted IMU correlate with spatial environmental structures (e.g., bending down to look inside an oven, washing dishes next to a sink), thereby serving as spatial anchors to compensate for the localization drift. The proposed EAIL framework learns such correlations via hierarchical multi-modal alignment. By assuming that the 3D point cloud of the environment is available, it contrastively learns modality encoders that align short-term egocentric action cues in IMU signals with local environmental features in the point cloud. These encoders are then used in reasoning the IMU data and the point cloud over time and space to perform inertial localization. Interestingly, these encoders can further be utilized to recognize the corresponding sequence of actions as a by-product. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art inertial localization and inertial action recognition baselines.

- **Summary**: World models, which predict transitions based on history observation and action sequences, have shown great promise in improving data efficiency for sequential decision making. However, existing world models often require extensive domain-specific training and still produce low-fidelity, coarse predictions, limiting their applicability in complex environments. In contrast, video diffusion models trained on large, internet-scale datasets have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality videos that capture diverse real-world dynamics. In this work, we present Vid2World, a general approach for leveraging and transferring pre-trained video diffusion models into interactive world models. To bridge the gap, Vid2World performs casualization of a pre-trained video diffusion model by crafting its architecture and training objective to enable autoregressive generation. Furthermore, it introduces a causal action guidance mechanism to enhance action controllability in the resulting interactive world model. Extensive experiments in robot manipulation and game simulation domains show that our method offers a scalable and effective approach for repurposing highly capable video diffusion models to interactive world models.

- **Summary**: Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues. To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets: DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased detectors.

- **Summary**: Vision-language modeling (VLM) aims to bridge the information gap between images and natural language. Under the new paradigm of first pre-training on massive image-text pairs and then fine-tuning on task-specific data, VLM in the remote sensing domain has made significant progress. The resulting models benefit from the absorption of extensive general knowledge and demonstrate strong performance across a variety of remote sensing data analysis tasks. Moreover, they are capable of interacting with users in a conversational manner. In this paper, we aim to provide the remote sensing community with a timely and comprehensive review of the developments in VLM using the two-stage paradigm. Specifically, we first cover a taxonomy of VLM in remote sensing: contrastive learning, visual instruction tuning, and text-conditioned image generation. For each category, we detail the commonly used network architecture and pre-training objectives. Second, we conduct a thorough review of existing works, examining foundation models and task-specific adaptation methods in contrastive-based VLM, architectural upgrades, training strategies and model capabilities in instruction-based VLM, as well as generative foundation models with their representative downstream applications. Third, we summarize datasets used for VLM pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, with an analysis of their construction methodologies (including image sources and caption generation) and key properties, such as scale and task adaptability. Finally, we conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future research directions: cross-modal representation alignment, vague requirement comprehension, explanation-driven model reliability, continually scalable model capabilities, and large-scale datasets featuring richer modalities and greater challenges.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet they are primarily constrained by text-based reasoning processes. However, achieving seamless integration of visual and textual reasoning which mirrors human cognitive processes remains a significant challenge. In particular, effectively incorporating advanced visual input processing into reasoning mechanisms is still an open question. Thus, in this paper, we explore the interleaved multimodal reasoning paradigm and introduce DeepEyes, a model with "thinking with images" capabilities incentivized through end-to-end reinforcement learning without the need for cold-start SFT. Notably, this ability emerges natively within the model itself, leveraging its inherent grounding ability as a tool instead of depending on separate specialized models. Specifically, we propose a tool-use-oriented data selection mechanism and a reward strategy to encourage successful tool-assisted reasoning trajectories. DeepEyes achieves significant performance gains on fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks and also demonstrates improvement in grounding, hallucination, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Interestingly, we observe the distinct evolution of tool-calling behavior from initial exploration to efficient and accurate exploitation, and diverse thinking patterns that closely mirror human visual reasoning processes.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved significant progress in medical image segmentation (SSMIS) through effective utilization of limited labeled data. While current SSL methods for medical images predominantly rely on consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling, they often overlook transferable semantic relationships across different clinical domains and imaging modalities. To address this, we propose TransMedSeg, a novel transferable semantic framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our approach introduces a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) module, which implicitly enhances feature representations by aligning domain-invariant semantics through cross-domain distribution matching and intra-domain structural preservation. Specifically, TransMedSeg constructs a unified feature space where teacher network features are adaptively augmented towards student network semantics via a lightweight memory module, enabling implicit semantic transformation without explicit data generation. Interestingly, this augmentation is implicitly realized through an expected transferable cross-entropy loss computed over the augmented teacher distribution. An upper bound of the expected loss is theoretically derived and minimized during training, incurring negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on medical image datasets demonstrate that TransMedSeg outperforms existing semi-supervised methods, establishing a new direction for transferable representation learning in medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (VI-CoT) enables MLLMs to continually update their understanding and decisions based on step-wise intermediate visual states (IVS), much like a human would, which demonstrates impressive success in various tasks, thereby leading to emerged advancements in related benchmarks. Despite promising progress, current benchmarks provide models with relatively fixed IVS, rather than free-style IVS, whch might forcibly distort the original thinking trajectories, failing to evaluate their intrinsic reasoning capabilities. More importantly, existing benchmarks neglect to systematically explore the impact factors that IVS would impart to untamed reasoning performance. To tackle above gaps, we introduce a specialized benchmark termed ViC-Bench, consisting of four representive tasks: maze navigation, jigsaw puzzle, embodied long-horizon planning, and complex counting, where each task has dedicated free-style IVS generation pipeline supporting function calls. To systematically examine VI-CoT capability, we propose a thorough evaluation suite incorporating a progressive three-stage strategy with targeted new metrics. Besides, we establish Incremental Prompting Information Injection (IPII) strategy to ablatively explore the prompting factors for VI-CoT. We extensively conduct evaluations for 18 advanced MLLMs, revealing key insights into their VI-CoT capability. Our proposed benchmark is publicly open at Huggingface.

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance on general video comprehension benchmarks. Nevertheless, for broader applications, the robustness of their temporal analysis capability needs to be thoroughly investigated yet predominantly ignored. Motivated by this, we propose a novel temporal robustness benchmark (TemRobBench), which introduces temporal inconsistency perturbations separately at the visual and textual modalities to assess the robustness of models. We evaluate 16 mainstream LMMs and find that they exhibit over-reliance on prior knowledge and textual context in adversarial environments, while ignoring the actual temporal dynamics in the video. To mitigate this issue, we design panoramic direct preference optimization (PanoDPO), which encourages LMMs to incorporate both visual and linguistic feature preferences simultaneously. Experimental results show that PanoDPO can effectively enhance the model's robustness and reliability in temporal analysis.

- **Summary**: The matching formulation makes it naturally hard for the stereo matching to handle ill-posed regions like occlusions and non-Lambertian surfaces. Fusing monocular priors has been proven helpful for ill-posed matching, but the biased monocular prior learned from small stereo datasets constrains the generalization. Recently, stereo matching has progressed by leveraging the unbiased monocular prior from the vision foundation model (VFM) to improve the generalization in ill-posed regions. We dive into the fusion process and observe three main problems limiting the fusion of the VFM monocular prior. The first problem is the misalignment between affine-invariant relative monocular depth and absolute depth of disparity. Besides, when we use the monocular feature in an iterative update structure, the over-confidence in the disparity update leads to local optima results. A direct fusion of a monocular depth map could alleviate the local optima problem, but noisy disparity results computed at the first several iterations will misguide the fusion. In this paper, we propose a binary local ordering map to guide the fusion, which converts the depth map into a binary relative format, unifying the relative and absolute depth representation. The computed local ordering map is also used to re-weight the initial disparity update, resolving the local optima and noisy problem. In addition, we formulate the final direct fusion of monocular depth to the disparity as a registration problem, where a pixel-wise linear regression module can globally and adaptively align them. Our method fully exploits the monocular prior to support stereo matching results effectively and efficiently. We significantly improve the performance from the experiments when generalizing from SceneFlow to Middlebury and Booster datasets while barely reducing the efficiency.

- **Summary**: Video large language models (VideoLLM) excel at video understanding, but face efficiency challenges due to the quadratic complexity of abundant visual tokens. Our systematic analysis of token compression methods for VideoLLMs reveals two critical issues: (i) overlooking distinctive visual signals across frames, leading to information loss; (ii) suffering from implementation constraints, causing incompatibility with modern architectures or efficient operators. To address these challenges, we distill three design principles for VideoLLM token compression and propose a plug-and-play inference acceleration framework "Video Compression Commander" (VidCom2). By quantifying each frame's uniqueness, VidCom2 adaptively adjusts compression intensity across frames, effectively preserving essential information while reducing redundancy in video sequences. Extensive experiments across various VideoLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our VidCom2. With only 25% visual tokens, VidCom2 achieves 99.6% of the original performance on LLaVA-OV while reducing 70.8% of the LLM generation latency. Notably, our Frame Compression Adjustment strategy is compatible with other token compression methods to further improve their performance.

- **Summary**: Accurately tracking particles and determining their position along the optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial positions from dual-focal plane images without relying on predefined models. Our method achieves an axial localization accuracy of 40 nanometers - six times better than traditional single-focal plane techniques. The model's simple design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses, including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific applications.

- **Summary**: DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in incentivizing reasoning and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, the potential of reasoning-induced computational modeling has not been thoroughly explored in the context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task critically dependent on visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a reasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with reinforcement learning to rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the intrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of images, we employ group relative policy optimization to generate multiple quality scores for each image. These estimates are then used to compute comparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other under the Thurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined using continuous fidelity measures rather than discretized binary labels. Extensive experiments show that the proposed VisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms discriminative deep learning-based NR-IQA models as well as a recent reasoning-induced quality regression method. Moreover, VisualQuality-R1 is capable of generating contextually rich, human-aligned quality descriptions, and supports multi-dataset training without requiring perceptual scale realignment. These features make VisualQuality-R1 especially well-suited for reliably measuring progress in a wide range of image processing tasks like super-resolution and image generation.

- **Summary**: As vision-language models (VLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, the need for accurate visual culture understanding is becoming critical. Yet, these models frequently fall short in interpreting cultural nuances effectively. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in enhancing cultural understanding in text-only settings, while its application in multimodal scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAVENEA (Retrieval-Augmented Visual culturE uNdErstAnding), a new benchmark designed to advance visual culture understanding through retrieval, focusing on two tasks: culture-focused visual question answering (cVQA) and culture-informed image captioning (cIC). RAVENEA extends existing datasets by integrating over 10,000 Wikipedia documents curated and ranked by human annotators. With RAVENEA, we train and evaluate seven multimodal retrievers for each image query, and measure the downstream impact of retrieval-augmented inputs across fourteen state-of-the-art VLMs. Our results show that lightweight VLMs, when augmented with culture-aware retrieval, outperform their non-augmented counterparts (by at least 3.2% absolute on cVQA and 6.2% absolute on cIC). This highlights the value of retrieval-augmented methods and culturally inclusive benchmarks for multimodal understanding.



### Enhancing Interpretability of Sparse Latent Representations with Class Information

- **Summary**: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models for learning latent representations. Standard VAEs generate dispersed and unstructured latent spaces by utilizing all dimensions, which limits their interpretability, especially in high-dimensional spaces. To address this challenge, Variational Sparse Coding (VSC) introduces a spike-and-slab prior distribution, resulting in sparse latent representations for each input. These sparse representations, characterized by a limited number of active dimensions, are inherently more interpretable. Despite this advantage, VSC falls short in providing structured interpretations across samples within the same class. Intuitively, samples from the same class are expected to share similar attributes while allowing for variations in those attributes. This expectation should manifest as consistent patterns of active dimensions in their latent representations, but VSC does not enforce such consistency.   In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the latent space interpretability by ensuring that the active dimensions in the latent space are consistent across samples within the same class. To achieve this, we introduce a new loss function that encourages samples from the same class to share similar active dimensions. This alignment creates a more structured and interpretable latent space, where each shared dimension corresponds to a high-level concept, or "factor." Unlike existing disentanglement-based methods that primarily focus on global factors shared across all classes, our method captures both global and class-specific factors, thereby enhancing the utility and interpretability of latent representations.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces ReservoirTTA, a novel plug-in framework designed for prolonged test-time adaptation (TTA) in scenarios where the test domain continuously shifts over time, including cases where domains recur or evolve gradually. At its core, ReservoirTTA maintains a reservoir of domain-specialized models -- an adaptive test-time model ensemble -- that both detects new domains via online clustering over style features of incoming samples and routes each sample to the appropriate specialized model, and thereby enables domain-specific adaptation. This multi-model strategy overcomes key limitations of single model adaptation, such as catastrophic forgetting, inter-domain interference, and error accumulation, ensuring robust and stable performance on sustained non-stationary test distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals key components that bound parameter variance and prevent model collapse, while our plug-in TTA module mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously encountered domains. Extensive experiments on the classification corruption benchmarks, including ImageNet-C and CIFAR-10/100-C, as well as the Cityscapes$\rightarrow$ACDC semantic segmentation task, covering recurring and continuously evolving domain shifts, demonstrate that ReservoirTTA significantly improves adaptation accuracy and maintains stable performance across prolonged, recurring shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: High-fidelity 3D object synthesis remains significantly more challenging than 2D image generation due to the unstructured nature of mesh data and the cubic complexity of dense volumetric grids. Existing two-stage pipelines-compressing meshes with a VAE (using either 2D or 3D supervision), followed by latent diffusion sampling-often suffer from severe detail loss caused by inefficient representations and modality mismatches introduced in VAE. We introduce Sparc3D, a unified framework that combines a sparse deformable marching cubes representation Sparcubes with a novel encoder Sparconv-VAE. Sparcubes converts raw meshes into high-resolution ($1024^3$) surfaces with arbitrary topology by scattering signed distance and deformation fields onto a sparse cube, allowing differentiable optimization. Sparconv-VAE is the first modality-consistent variational autoencoder built entirely upon sparse convolutional networks, enabling efficient and near-lossless 3D reconstruction suitable for high-resolution generative modeling through latent diffusion. Sparc3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity on challenging inputs, including open surfaces, disconnected components, and intricate geometry. It preserves fine-grained shape details, reduces training and inference cost, and integrates naturally with latent diffusion models for scalable, high-resolution 3D generation.

- **Summary**: A face morph is created by combining two (or more) face images corresponding to two (or more) identities to produce a composite that successfully matches the constituent identities. Reference-free (RF) demorphing reverses this process using only the morph image, without the need for additional reference images. Previous RF demorphing methods were overly constrained, as they rely on assumptions about the distributions of training and testing morphs such as the morphing technique used, face style, and images used to create the morph. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach that effectively disentangles component images from a composite morph image with high visual fidelity. Our method is the first to generalize across morph techniques and face styles, beating the current state of the art by $\geq 59.46\%$ under a common training protocol across all datasets tested. We train our method on morphs created using synthetically generated face images and test on real morphs, thereby enhancing the practicality of the technique. Experiments on six datasets and two face matchers establish the utility and efficacy of our method.

- **Summary**: Personalizing 3D scenes from a single reference image enables intuitive user-guided editing, which requires achieving both multi-view consistency across perspectives and referential consistency with the input image. However, these goals are particularly challenging due to the viewpoint bias caused by the limited perspective provided in a single image. Lacking the mechanisms to effectively expand reference information beyond the original view, existing methods of image-conditioned 3DGS personalization often suffer from this viewpoint bias and struggle to produce consistent results. Therefore, in this paper, we present Consistent Personalization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (CP-GS), a framework that progressively propagates the single-view reference appearance to novel perspectives. In particular, CP-GS integrates pre-trained image-to-3D generation and iterative LoRA fine-tuning to extract and extend the reference appearance, and finally produces faithful multi-view guidance images and the personalized 3DGS outputs through a view-consistent generation process guided by geometric cues. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes show that our CP-GS effectively mitigates the viewpoint bias, achieving high-quality personalization that significantly outperforms existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/Yuxuan-W/CP-GS.

- **Summary**: Efficient video coding is highly dependent on exploiting the temporal redundancy, which is usually achieved by extracting and leveraging the temporal context in the emerging conditional coding-based neural video codec (NVC). Although the latest NVC has achieved remarkable progress in improving the compression performance, the inherent temporal context propagation mechanism lacks the ability to sufficiently leverage the reference information, limiting further improvement. In this paper, we address the limitation by modulating the temporal context with the reference frame in two steps. Specifically, we first propose the flow orientation to mine the inter-correlation between the reference frame and prediction frame for generating the additional oriented temporal context. Moreover, we introduce the context compensation to leverage the oriented context to modulate the propagated temporal context generated from the propagated reference feature. Through the synergy mechanism and decoupling loss supervision, the irrelevant propagated information can be effectively eliminated to ensure better context modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our codec achieves on average 22.7% bitrate reduction over the advanced traditional video codec H.266/VVC, and offers an average 10.1% bitrate saving over the previous state-of-the-art NVC DCVC-FM.

- **Summary**: Brain-to-image decoding has been recently propelled by the progress in generative AI models and the availability of large ultra-high field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). However, current approaches depend on complicated multi-stage pipelines and preprocessing steps that typically collapse the temporal dimension of brain recordings, thereby limiting time-resolved brain decoders. Here, we introduce Dynadiff (Dynamic Neural Activity Diffusion for Image Reconstruction), a new single-stage diffusion model designed for reconstructing images from dynamically evolving fMRI recordings. Our approach offers three main contributions. First, Dynadiff simplifies training as compared to existing approaches. Second, our model outperforms state-of-the-art models on time-resolved fMRI signals, especially on high-level semantic image reconstruction metrics, while remaining competitive on preprocessed fMRI data that collapse time. Third, this approach allows a precise characterization of the evolution of image representations in brain activity. Overall, this work lays the foundation for time-resolved brain-to-image decoding.

- **Summary**: Inverse scattering is a fundamental challenge in many imaging applications, ranging from microscopy to remote sensing. Solving this problem often requires jointly estimating two unknowns -- the image and the scattering field inside the object -- necessitating effective image prior to regularize the inference. In this paper, we propose a regularized neural field (NF) approach which integrates the denoising score function used in score-based generative models. The neural field formulation offers convenient flexibility to performing joint estimation, while the denoising score function imposes the rich structural prior of images. Our results on three high-contrast simulated objects show that the proposed approach yields a better imaging quality compared to the state-of-the-art NF approach, where regularization is based on total variation.

- **Summary**: The International Society of Ultrasound advocates Intrapartum Ultrasound (US) Imaging in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) to monitor labour progression through changes in fetal head position. Two reliable ultrasound-derived parameters that are used to predict outcomes of instrumental vaginal delivery are the angle of progression (AoP) and head-symphysis distance (HSD). In this work, as part of the Intrapartum Ultrasounds Grand Challenge (IUGC) 2024, we propose an automated fetal biometry measurement pipeline to reduce intra- and inter-observer variability and improve measurement reliability. Our pipeline consists of three key tasks: (i) classification of standard planes (SP) from US videos, (ii) segmentation of fetal head and pubic symphysis from the detected SPs, and (iii) computation of the AoP and HSD from the segmented regions. We perform sparse sampling to mitigate class imbalances and reduce spurious correlations in task (i), and utilize ensemble-based deep learning methods for task (i) and (ii) to enhance generalizability under different US acquisition settings. Finally, to promote robustness in task iii) with respect to the structural fidelity of measurements, we retain the largest connected components and apply ellipse fitting to the segmentations. Our solution achieved ACC: 0.9452, F1: 0.9225, AUC: 0.983, MCC: 0.8361, DSC: 0.918, HD: 19.73, ASD: 5.71, $\Delta_{AoP}$: 8.90 and $\Delta_{HSD}$: 14.35 across an unseen hold-out set of 4 patients and 224 US frames. The results from the proposed automated pipeline can improve the understanding of labour arrest causes and guide the development of clinical risk stratification tools for efficient and effective prenatal care.

- **Summary**: Recently proposed neural network architectures like PointNet [QSMG16] and PointNet++ [QYSG17] have made it possible to apply Deep Learning to 3D point sets. The feature representations of shapes learned by these two networks enabled training classifiers for Semantic Segmentation, and more recently for Instance Segmentation via the Similarity Group Proposal Network (SGPN) [WYHN17]. One area of improvement which has been highlighted by SGPN's authors, pertains to use of memory intensive similarity matrices which occupy memory quadratic in the number of points. In this report, we attempt to tackle this issue through use of two sampling based methods, which compute Instance Segmentation on a sub-sampled Point Set, and then extrapolate labels to the complete set using the nearest neigbhour approach. While both approaches perform equally well on large sub-samples, the random-based strategy gives the most improvements in terms of speed and memory usage.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of reconstructing a 3D scene from multiple sketches. We propose a pipeline which involves (1) stitching together multiple sketches through use of correspondence points, (2) converting the stitched sketch into a realistic image using a CycleGAN, and (3) estimating that image's depth-map using a pre-trained convolutional neural network based architecture called MegaDepth. Our contribution includes constructing a dataset of image-sketch pairs, the images for which are from the Zurich Building Database, and sketches have been generated by us. We use this dataset to train a CycleGAN for our pipeline's second step. We end up with a stitching process that does not generalize well to real drawings, but the rest of the pipeline that creates a 3D reconstruction from a single sketch performs quite well on a wide variety of drawings.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and the abundance of food data have resulted in studies to improve food understanding using LLMs. Despite several recommendation systems utilizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), there has been limited research on integrating food related KGs with LLMs. We introduce KERL, a unified system that leverages food KGs and LLMs to provide personalized food recommendations and generates recipes with associated micro-nutritional information. Given a natural language question, KERL extracts entities, retrieves subgraphs from the KG, which are then fed into the LLM as context to select the recipes that satisfy the constraints. Next, our system generates the cooking steps and nutritional information for each recipe. To evaluate our approach, we also develop a benchmark dataset by curating recipe related questions, combined with constraints and personal preferences. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed KG-augmented LLM significantly outperforms existing approaches, offering a complete and coherent solution for food recommendation, recipe generation, and nutritional analysis. Our code and benchmark datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/mohbattharani/KERL.

- **Summary**: Due to low spatial resolution, hyperspectral data often consists of mixtures of contributions from multiple materials. This limitation motivates the task of hyperspectral unmixing (HU), a fundamental problem in hyperspectral imaging. HU aims to identify the spectral signatures (\textit{endmembers}) of the materials present in an observed scene, along with their relative proportions (\textit{fractional abundance}) in each pixel. A major challenge lies in the class variability in materials, which hinders accurate representation by a single spectral signature, as assumed in the conventional linear mixing model. Moreover, To address this issue, we propose using group sparsity after representing each material with a set of spectral signatures, known as endmember bundles, where each group corresponds to a specific material. In particular, we develop a bundle-based framework that can enforce either inter-group sparsity or sparsity within and across groups (SWAG) on the abundance coefficients. Furthermore, our framework offers the flexibility to incorporate a variety of sparsity-promoting penalties, among which the transformed $\ell_1$ (TL1) penalty is a novel regularization in the HU literature. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real hyperspectral data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approaches.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of applications, from natural language processing and computer vision to speech recognition. However, as tasks become increasingly complex, model sizes continue to grow, posing challenges in latency and memory efficiency. To meet these constraints, post-training quantization has emerged as a promising solution. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware-efficient quantization and inference scheme that exploits hardware advantages with minimal accuracy degradation. Specifically, we introduce a W4A8 scheme, where weights are quantized and stored using 4-bit integer precision, and inference computations are performed using 8-bit floating-point arithmetic, demonstrating significant speedups and improved memory utilization compared to 16-bit operations, applicable on various modern accelerators. To mitigate accuracy loss, we develop a novel quantization algorithm, dubbed Dual Precision Quantization (DPQ), that leverages the unique structure of our scheme without introducing additional inference overhead. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance (i.e., increased throughput) while maintaining tolerable accuracy degradation relative to the full-precision model.

- **Summary**: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for long video understanding (LVU), prompting the development of standardized LVU benchmarks to evaluate their performance. However, our investigation reveals a rather sober lesson for existing LVU benchmarks. First, most existing benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions (MCQs), whose evaluation results are inflated due to the possibility of guessing the correct answer; Second, a significant portion of questions in these benchmarks have strong priors to allow models to answer directly without even reading the input video. For example, Gemini-1.5-Pro can achieve over 50\% accuracy given a random frame from a long video on Video-MME. We also observe that increasing the number of frames does not necessarily lead to improvement on existing benchmarks, which is counterintuitive. As a result, the validity and robustness of current LVU benchmarks are undermined, impeding a faithful assessment of LMMs' long-video understanding capability. To tackle this problem, we propose VideoEval-Pro, a realistic LVU benchmark containing questions with open-ended short-answer, which truly require understanding the entire video. VideoEval-Pro assesses both segment-level and full-video understanding through perception and reasoning tasks. By evaluating 21 proprietary and open-source video LMMs, we conclude the following findings: (1) video LMMs show drastic performance ($>$25\%) drops on open-ended questions compared with MCQs; (2) surprisingly, higher MCQ scores do not lead to higher open-ended scores on VideoEval-Pro; (3) compared to other MCQ benchmarks, VideoEval-Pro benefits more from increasing the number of input frames. Our results show that VideoEval-Pro offers a more realistic and reliable measure of long video understanding, providing a clearer view of progress in this domain.

- **Summary**: Efficient creation of accurate and editable 3D CAD models is critical in engineering design, significantly impacting cost and time-to-market in product innovation. Current manual workflows remain highly time-consuming and demand extensive user expertise. While recent developments in AI-driven CAD generation show promise, existing models are limited by incomplete representations of CAD operations, inability to generalize to real-world images, and low output accuracy. This paper introduces CAD-Coder, an open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) explicitly fine-tuned to generate editable CAD code (CadQuery Python) directly from visual input. Leveraging a novel dataset that we created--GenCAD-Code, consisting of over 163k CAD-model image and code pairs--CAD-Coder outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines such as GPT-4.5 and Qwen2.5-VL-72B, achieving a 100% valid syntax rate and the highest accuracy in 3D solid similarity. Notably, our VLM demonstrates some signs of generalizability, successfully generating CAD code from real-world images and executing CAD operations unseen during fine-tuning. The performance and adaptability of CAD-Coder highlights the potential of VLMs fine-tuned on code to streamline CAD workflows for engineers and designers.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant responses, they often struggle with understanding when to speak, particularly in delivering brief, timely reactions during ongoing conversations. This limitation arises largely from their reliance on text input, lacking the rich contextual cues in real-world human dialogue. In this work, we focus on real-time prediction of response types, with an emphasis on short, reactive utterances that depend on subtle, multimodal signals across vision, audio, and text. To support this, we introduce a new multimodal dataset constructed from real-world conversational videos, containing temporally aligned visual, auditory, and textual streams. This dataset enables fine-grained modeling of response timing in dyadic interactions. Building on this dataset, we propose MM-When2Speak, a multimodal LLM-based model that adaptively integrates visual, auditory, and textual context to predict when a response should occur, and what type of response is appropriate. Experiments show that MM-When2Speak significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unimodal and LLM-based baselines, achieving up to a 4x improvement in response timing accuracy over leading commercial LLMs. These results underscore the importance of multimodal inputs for producing timely, natural, and engaging conversational AI.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce EmoGist, a training-free, in-context learning method for performing visual emotion classification with LVLMs. The key intuition of our approach is that context-dependent definition of emotion labels could allow more accurate predictions of emotions, as the ways in which emotions manifest within images are highly context dependent and nuanced. EmoGist pre-generates multiple explanations of emotion labels, by analyzing the clusters of example images belonging to each category. At test time, we retrieve a version of explanation based on embedding similarity, and feed it to a fast VLM for classification. Through our experiments, we show that EmoGist allows up to 13 points improvement in micro F1 scores with the multi-label Memotion dataset, and up to 8 points in macro F1 in the multi-class FI dataset.

- **Summary**: Cross-modal embeddings form the foundation for multi-modal models. However, visualization methods for interpreting cross-modal embeddings have been primarily confined to traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques like PCA and t-SNE. These DR methods primarily focus on feature distributions within a single modality, whilst failing to incorporate metrics (e.g., CLIPScore) across multiple modalities.This paper introduces AKRMap, a new DR technique designed to visualize cross-modal embeddings metric with enhanced accuracy by learning kernel regression of the metric landscape in the projection space. Specifically, AKRMap constructs a supervised projection network guided by a post-projection kernel regression loss, and employs adaptive generalized kernels that can be jointly optimized with the projection. This approach enables AKRMap to efficiently generate visualizations that capture complex metric distributions, while also supporting interactive features such as zoom and overlay for deeper exploration. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that AKRMap outperforms existing DR methods in generating more accurate and trustworthy visualizations. We further showcase the effectiveness of AKRMap in visualizing and comparing cross-modal embeddings for text-to-image models. Code and demo are available at https://github.com/yilinye/AKRMap.

- **Summary**: Personalized models have demonstrated remarkable success in understanding and generating concepts provided by users. However, existing methods use separate concept tokens for understanding and generation, treating these tasks in isolation. This may result in limitations for generating images with complex prompts. For example, given the concept $\langle bo\rangle$, generating "$\langle bo\rangle$ wearing its hat" without additional textual descriptions of its hat. We call this kind of generation personalized knowledge-driven generation. To address the limitation, we present UniCTokens, a novel framework that effectively integrates personalized information into a unified vision language model (VLM) for understanding and generation. UniCTokens trains a set of unified concept tokens to leverage complementary semantics, boosting two personalized tasks. Moreover, we propose a progressive training strategy with three stages: understanding warm-up, bootstrapping generation from understanding, and deepening understanding from generation to enhance mutual benefits between both tasks. To quantitatively evaluate the unified VLM personalization, we present UnifyBench, the first benchmark for assessing concept understanding, concept generation, and knowledge-driven generation. Experimental results on UnifyBench indicate that UniCTokens shows competitive performance compared to leading methods in concept understanding, concept generation, and achieving state-of-the-art results in personalized knowledge-driven generation. Our research demonstrates that enhanced understanding improves generation, and the generation process can yield valuable insights into understanding.

- **Summary**: Invisible image watermarking can protect image ownership and prevent malicious misuse of visual generative models. However, existing generative watermarking methods are mainly designed for diffusion models while watermarking for autoregressive image generation models remains largely underexplored. We propose IndexMark, a training-free watermarking framework for autoregressive image generation models. IndexMark is inspired by the redundancy property of the codebook: replacing autoregressively generated indices with similar indices produces negligible visual differences. The core component in IndexMark is a simple yet effective match-then-replace method, which carefully selects watermark tokens from the codebook based on token similarity, and promotes the use of watermark tokens through token replacement, thereby embedding the watermark without affecting the image quality. Watermark verification is achieved by calculating the proportion of watermark tokens in generated images, with precision further improved by an Index Encoder. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary validation scheme to enhance robustness against cropping attacks. Experiments demonstrate that IndexMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of image quality and verification accuracy, and exhibits robustness against various perturbations, including cropping, noises, Gaussian blur, random erasing, color jittering, and JPEG compression.

- **Summary**: Learning general-purpose reasoning capabilities has long been a challenging problem in AI. Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models (VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1, outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures within Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive reasoning capabilities by selectively activating experts to facilitate structured cognitive processes. Despite notable advances, existing reasoning models often suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like overthinking and underthinking. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel inference-time steering methodology called Reinforcing Cognitive Experts (RICE), designed to improve reasoning performance without additional training or complex heuristics. Leveraging normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (nPMI), we systematically identify specialized experts, termed ''cognitive experts'' that orchestrate meta-level reasoning operations characterized by tokens like ''<think>''. Empirical evaluations with leading MoE-based LRMs (DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B) on rigorous quantitative and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate noticeable and consistent improvements in reasoning accuracy, cognitive efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Crucially, our lightweight approach substantially outperforms prevalent reasoning-steering techniques, such as prompt design and decoding constraints, while preserving the model's general instruction-following skills. These results highlight reinforcing cognitive experts as a promising, practical, and interpretable direction to enhance cognitive efficiency within advanced reasoning models.

- **Summary**: We introduce UniGen, a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of image understanding and generation. We study the full training pipeline of UniGen from a data-centric perspective, including multi-stage pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. More importantly, we propose a new Chain-of-Thought Verification (CoT-V) strategy for test-time scaling, which significantly boosts UniGen's image generation quality using a simple Best-of-N test-time strategy. Specifically, CoT-V enables UniGen to act as both image generator and verifier at test time, assessing the semantic alignment between a text prompt and its generated image in a step-by-step CoT manner. Trained entirely on open-source datasets across all stages, UniGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of image understanding and generation benchmarks, with a final score of 0.78 on GenEval and 85.19 on DPG-Bench. Through extensive ablation studies, our work provides actionable insights and addresses key challenges in the full life cycle of building unified MLLMs, contributing meaningful directions to the future research.

- **Summary**: Unifying multimodal understanding and generation has shown impressive capabilities in cutting-edge proprietary systems. In this work, we introduce BAGEL, an open0source foundational model that natively supports multimodal understanding and generation. BAGEL is a unified, decoder0only model pretrained on trillions of tokens curated from large0scale interleaved text, image, video, and web data. When scaled with such diverse multimodal interleaved data, BAGEL exhibits emerging capabilities in complex multimodal reasoning. As a result, it significantly outperforms open-source unified models in both multimodal generation and understanding across standard benchmarks, while exhibiting advanced multimodal reasoning abilities such as free-form image manipulation, future frame prediction, 3D manipulation, and world navigation. In the hope of facilitating further opportunities for multimodal research, we share the key findings, pretraining details, data creation protocal, and release our code and checkpoints to the community.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Diffusion-based Transformers have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities, but their high computational costs hinder practical deployment, for example, generating an $8192\times 8192$ image can take over an hour on an A100 GPU. In this work, we propose GRAT (\textbf{GR}ouping first, \textbf{AT}tending smartly), a training-free attention acceleration strategy for fast image and video generation without compromising output quality. The key insight is to exploit the inherent sparsity in learned attention maps (which tend to be locally focused) in pretrained Diffusion Transformers and leverage better GPU parallelism. Specifically, GRAT first partitions contiguous tokens into non-overlapping groups, aligning both with GPU execution patterns and the local attention structures learned in pretrained generative Transformers. It then accelerates attention by having all query tokens within the same group share a common set of attendable key and value tokens. These key and value tokens are further restricted to structured regions, such as surrounding blocks or criss-cross regions, significantly reducing computational overhead (e.g., attaining a \textbf{35.8$\times$} speedup over full attention when generating $8192\times 8192$ images) while preserving essential attention patterns and long-range context. We validate GRAT on pretrained Flux and HunyuanVideo for image and video generation, respectively. In both cases, GRAT achieves substantially faster inference without any fine-tuning, while maintaining the performance of full attention. We hope GRAT will inspire future research on accelerating Diffusion Transformers for scalable visual generation.

- **Summary**: Many practical medical imaging scenarios include categories that are under-represented but still crucial. The relevance of image recognition models to real-world applications lies in their ability to generalize to these rare classes as well as unseen classes. Real-world generalization requires taking into account the various complexities that can be encountered in the real-world. First, training data is highly imbalanced, which may lead to model exhibiting bias toward the more frequently represented classes. Moreover, real-world data may contain unseen classes that need to be identified, and model performance is affected by the data scarcity. While medical image recognition has been extensively addressed in the literature, current methods do not take into account all the intricacies in the real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose an open-set learning method for highly imbalanced medical datasets using a semi-supervised approach. Understanding the adverse impact of long-tail distribution at the inherent model characteristics, we implement a regularization strategy at the feature level complemented by a classifier normalization technique. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available datasets, ISIC2018, ISIC2019, and TissueMNIST with various numbers of labelled samples. Our analysis shows that addressing the impact of long-tail data in classification significantly improves the overall performance of the network in terms of closed-set and open-set accuracies on all datasets. Our code and trained models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Daniyanaj/OpenLTR.

- **Summary**: We introduce a unified approach to forecast the dynamics of human keypoints along with the motion trajectory based on a short sequence of input poses. While many studies address either full-body pose prediction or motion trajectory prediction, only a few attempt to merge them. We propose a motion transformation technique to simultaneously predict full-body pose and trajectory key-points in a global coordinate frame. We utilize an off-the-shelf 3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware navigation. We introduce a human navigation dataset ``DARKO'' with specific focus on navigational activities that are relevant for human-aware mobile robot navigation. We perform extensive evaluation on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and our DARKO dataset. In comparison to prior work, we show that our approach is compact, real-time, and accurate in predicting human navigation motion across all datasets. Result animations, our dataset, and code will be available at https://nisarganc.github.io/UPTor-page/

- **Summary**: We propose an OCT super-resolution framework based on a plug-and-play diffusion model (PnP-DM) to reconstruct high-quality images from sparse measurements (OCT B-mode corneal images). Our method formulates reconstruction as an inverse problem, combining a diffusion prior with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for efficient posterior inference. We collect high-speed under-sampled B-mode corneal images and apply a deep learning-based up-sampling pipeline to build realistic training pairs. Evaluations on in vivo and ex vivo fish-eye corneal models show that PnP-DM outperforms conventional 2D-UNet baselines, producing sharper structures and better noise suppression. This approach advances high-fidelity OCT imaging in high-speed acquisition for clinical applications.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds strong potential for medical diagnostics, yet its clinical adoption is limited by a lack of interpretability and generalizability. This study introduces the Pathobiological Dictionary for Liver Cancer (LCP1.0), a practical framework designed to translate complex Pathomics and Radiomics Features (PF and RF) into clinically meaningful insights aligned with existing diagnostic workflows. QuPath and PyRadiomics, standardized according to IBSI guidelines, were used to extract 333 imaging features from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples, including 240 PF-based-cell detection/intensity, 74 RF-based texture, and 19 RF-based first-order features. Expert-defined ROIs from the public dataset excluded artifact-prone areas, and features were aggregated at the case level. Their relevance to the WHO grading system was assessed using multiple classifiers linked with feature selectors. The resulting dictionary was validated by 8 experts in oncology and pathology. In collaboration with 10 domain experts, we developed a Pathobiological dictionary of imaging features such as PFs and RF. In our study, the Variable Threshold feature selection algorithm combined with the SVM model achieved the highest accuracy (0.80, P-value less than 0.05), selecting 20 key features, primarily clinical and pathomics traits such as Centroid, Cell Nucleus, and Cytoplasmic characteristics. These features, particularly nuclear and cytoplasmic, were strongly associated with tumor grading and prognosis, reflecting atypia indicators like pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, and cellular orientation.The LCP1.0 provides a clinically validated bridge between AI outputs and expert interpretation, enhancing model transparency and usability. Aligning AI-derived features with clinical semantics supports the development of interpretable, trustworthy diagnostic tools for liver cancer pathology.

- **Summary**: This study presents a robust framework that leverages advanced imaging techniques and machine learning for feature extraction and classification of key human attributes-namely skin tone, hair color, iris color, and vein-based undertones. The system employs a multi-stage pipeline involving face detection, region segmentation, and dominant color extraction to isolate and analyze these features. Techniques such as X-means clustering, alongside perceptually uniform distance metrics like Delta E (CIEDE2000), are applied within both LAB and HSV color spaces to enhance the accuracy of color differentiation. For classification, the dominant tones of the skin, hair, and iris are extracted and matched to a custom tone scale, while vein analysis from wrist images enables undertone classification into "Warm" or "Cool" based on LAB differences. Each module uses targeted segmentation and color space transformations to ensure perceptual precision. The system achieves up to 80% accuracy in tone classification using the Delta E-HSV method with Gaussian blur, demonstrating reliable performance across varied lighting and image conditions. This work highlights the potential of AI-powered color analysis and feature extraction for delivering inclusive, precise, and nuanced classification, supporting applications in beauty technology, digital personalization, and visual analytics.

- **Summary**: The task of estimating the world model describing the dynamics of a real world process assumes immense importance for anticipating and preparing for future outcomes. For applications such as video surveillance, robotics applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames. Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal data in Earth Observation (EO) presents a huge opportunity for improving transfer learning capabilities when pre-training deep learning models. Unlike prior work that often overlooks multi-modal EO data, recent methods have started to include it, resulting in more effective pre-training strategies. However, existing approaches commonly face challenges in effectively transferring learning to downstream tasks where the structure of available data differs from that used during pre-training. This paper addresses this limitation by exploring a more flexible multi-modal, multi-task pre-training strategy for EO data. Specifically, we adopt a Multi-modal Multi-task Masked Autoencoder (MultiMAE) that we pre-train by reconstructing diverse input modalities, including spectral, elevation, and segmentation data. The pre-trained model demonstrates robust transfer learning capabilities, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on various EO datasets for classification and segmentation tasks. Our approach exhibits significant flexibility, handling diverse input configurations without requiring modality-specific pre-trained models.
