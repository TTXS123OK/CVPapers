- **Summary**: Prompt learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting vision-language models such as CLIP to downstream tasks. However, existing methods often overfit to seen data, leading to significant performance degradation when generalizing to novel classes or unseen domains. To address this limitation, we propose DiSa, a Directional Saliency-Aware Prompt Learning framework that integrates two complementary regularization strategies to enhance generalization. First, our Cross-Interactive Regularization (CIR) fosters cross-modal alignment by enabling cooperative learning between prompted and frozen encoders. Within CIR, a saliency-aware masking strategy guides the image encoder to prioritize semantically critical image regions, reducing reliance on less informative patches. Second, we introduce a directional regularization strategy that aligns visual embeddings with class-wise prototype features in a directional manner to prioritize consistency in feature orientation over strict proximity. This approach ensures robust generalization by leveraging stable prototype directions derived from class-mean statistics. Extensive evaluations on 11 diverse image classification benchmarks demonstrate that DiSa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods across various settings, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, domain generalization, and few-shot learning.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art text-to-motion generation models rely on the kinematic-aware, local-relative motion representation popularized by HumanML3D, which encodes motion relative to the pelvis and to the previous frame with built-in redundancy. While this design simplifies training for earlier generation models, it introduces critical limitations for diffusion models and hinders applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we revisit the motion representation and propose a radically simplified and long-abandoned alternative for text-to-motion generation: absolute joint coordinates in global space. Through systematic analysis of design choices, we show that this formulation achieves significantly higher motion fidelity, improved text alignment, and strong scalability, even with a simple Transformer backbone and no auxiliary kinematic-aware losses. Moreover, our formulation naturally supports downstream tasks such as text-driven motion control and temporal/spatial editing without additional task-specific reengineering and costly classifier guidance generation from control signals. Finally, we demonstrate promising generalization to directly generate SMPL-H mesh vertices in motion from text, laying a strong foundation for future research and motion-related applications.

- **Summary**: Research interest in end-to-end autonomous driving has surged owing to its fully differentiable design integrating modular tasks, i.e. perception, prediction and planing, which enables optimization in pursuit of the ultimate goal. Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view) computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA. We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0 PDMS.

- **Summary**: Limited Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) often faces significant challenges due to missing angular information. Unlike previous methods that operate in the image domain, we propose a new method that focuses on sinogram inpainting. We leverage MR-SDEs, a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion process with mean-reverting stochastic differential equations, to fill in missing angular data at the projection level. Furthermore, by combining distillation with constraining the output of the model using the pseudo-inverse of the inpainting matrix, the diffusion process is accelerated and done in a step, enabling efficient and accurate sinogram completion. A subsequent post-processing module back-projects the inpainted sinogram into the image domain and further refines the reconstruction, effectively suppressing artifacts while preserving critical structural details. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual and fidelity quality, offering a promising solution for LACT reconstruction in scientific and clinical applications.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in video generation models have sparked interest in world models capable of simulating realistic environments. While navigation has been well-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces remain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces as a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable users to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as poking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric. We demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond realistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion prior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics simulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the difficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in the real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in synthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of physics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can generalize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning from videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few objects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse geometries, settings, and materials. We also try to understand the source of this generalization and perform ablations that reveal two key elements: visual diversity and the use of specific text keywords during training. Our approach is trained on only around 15k training examples for a single day on four A100 GPUs, and outperforms existing methods on force adherence and physics realism, bringing world models closer to real-world physics interactions. We release all datasets, code, weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

- **Summary**: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse visual content from natural language prompts. However, uncontrolled reproduction of sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful imagery poses serious ethical, legal, and safety challenges. To address these concerns, the concept erasure paradigm has emerged as a promising direction, enabling the selective removal of specific semantic concepts from generative models while preserving their overall utility. This survey provides a comprehensive overview and in-depth synthesis of concept erasure techniques in T2I diffusion models. We systematically categorize existing approaches along three key dimensions: intervention level, which identifies specific model components targeted for concept removal; optimization structure, referring to the algorithmic strategies employed to achieve suppression; and semantic scope, concerning the complexity and nature of the concepts addressed. This multi-dimensional taxonomy enables clear, structured comparisons across diverse methodologies, highlighting fundamental trade-offs between erasure specificity, generalization, and computational complexity. We further discuss current evaluation benchmarks, standardized metrics, and practical datasets, emphasizing gaps that limit comprehensive assessment, particularly regarding robustness and practical effectiveness. Finally, we outline major challenges and promising future directions, including disentanglement of concept representations, adaptive and incremental erasure strategies, adversarial robustness, and new generative architectures. This survey aims to guide researchers toward safer, more ethically aligned generative models, providing foundational knowledge and actionable recommendations to advance responsible development in generative AI.

- **Summary**: Federated Active Learning (FAL) seeks to reduce the burden of annotation under the realistic constraints of federated learning by leveraging Active Learning (AL). As FAL settings make it more expensive to obtain ground truth labels, FAL strategies that work well in low-budget regimes, where the amount of annotation is very limited, are needed. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of TypiClust, a successful low-budget AL strategy, in low-budget FAL settings. Our empirical results show that TypiClust works well even in low-budget FAL settings contrasted with relatively low performances of other methods, although these settings present additional challenges, such as data heterogeneity, compared to AL. In addition, we show that FAL settings cause distribution shifts in terms of typicality, but TypiClust is not very vulnerable to the shifts. We also analyze the sensitivity of TypiClust to feature extraction methods, and it suggests a way to perform FAL even in limited data situations.

- **Summary**: Recent multimodal image generators such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at following complex instructions, editing images and maintaining concept consistency. However, they are still evaluated by disjoint toolkits: text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks that lacks multi-modal conditioning, and customized image generation benchmarks that overlook compositional semantics and common knowledge. We propose MMIG-Bench, a comprehensive Multi-Modal Image Generation Benchmark that unifies these tasks by pairing 4,850 richly annotated text prompts with 1,750 multi-view reference images across 380 subjects, spanning humans, animals, objects, and artistic styles. MMIG-Bench is equipped with a three-level evaluation framework: (1) low-level metrics for visual artifacts and identity preservation of objects; (2) novel Aspect Matching Score (AMS): a VQA-based mid-level metric that delivers fine-grained prompt-image alignment and shows strong correlation with human judgments; and (3) high-level metrics for aesthetics and human preference. Using MMIG-Bench, we benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro, FLUX, DreamBooth, and IP-Adapter, and validate our metrics with 32k human ratings, yielding in-depth insights into architecture and data design. We will release the dataset and evaluation code to foster rigorous, unified evaluation and accelerate future innovations in multi-modal image generation.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods have demonstrated exceptional localization precision and remarkable dense mapping performance. However, dynamic objects introduce critical challenges by disrupting scene consistency, leading to tracking drift and mapping artifacts. Existing methods that employ semantic segmentation or object detection for dynamic identification and filtering typically rely on predefined categorical priors, while discarding dynamic scene information crucial for robotic applications such as dynamic obstacle avoidance and environmental interaction. To overcome these challenges, we propose ADD-SLAM: an Adaptive Dynamic Dense SLAM framework based on Gaussian splitting. We design an adaptive dynamic identification mechanism grounded in scene consistency analysis, comparing geometric and textural discrepancies between real-time observations and historical maps. Ours requires no predefined semantic category priors and adaptively discovers scene dynamics. Precise dynamic object recognition effectively mitigates interference from moving targets during localization. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic-static separation mapping strategy that constructs a temporal Gaussian model to achieve online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate our method's flexible and accurate dynamic segmentation capabilities, along with state-of-the-art performance in both localization and mapping.

- **Summary**: Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) adapts models to target domains by selectively labeling a few target samples. Existing ADA methods prioritize uncertain samples but overlook confident ones, which often match ground-truth. We find that incorporating confident predictions into the labeled set before active sampling reduces the search space and improves adaptation. To address this, we propose a collaborative framework that labels uncertain samples while treating highly confident predictions as ground truth. Our method combines Gaussian Process-based Active Sampling (GPAS) for identifying uncertain samples and Pseudo-Label-based Certain Sampling (PLCS) for confident ones, progressively enhancing adaptation. PLCS refines the search space, and GPAS reduces the domain gap, boosting the proportion of confident samples. Extensive experiments on Office-Home and DomainNet show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art ADA methods.

- **Summary**: We present LlamaSeg, a visual autoregressive framework that unifies multiple image segmentation tasks via natural language instructions. We reformulate image segmentation as a visual generation problem, representing masks as "visual" tokens and employing a LLaMA-style Transformer to predict them directly from image inputs. By adhering to the next-token prediction paradigm, our approach naturally integrates segmentation tasks into autoregressive architectures. To support large-scale training, we introduce a data annotation pipeline and construct the SA-OVRS dataset, which contains 2M segmentation masks annotated with over 5,800 open-vocabulary labels or diverse textual descriptions, covering a wide spectrum of real-world scenarios. This enables our model to localize objects in images based on text prompts and to generate fine-grained masks. To more accurately evaluate the quality of masks produced by visual generative models, we further propose a composite metric that combines Intersection over Union (IoU) with Average Hausdorff Distance (AHD), offering a more precise assessment of contour fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing generative models across multiple datasets and yields more detailed segmentation masks.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enhanced their image inpainting and editing capabilities but also introduced significant societal risks. Adversaries can exploit user images from social media to generate misleading or harmful content. While adversarial perturbations can disrupt inpainting, global perturbation-based methods fail in mask-guided editing tasks due to spatial constraints. To address these challenges, we propose Structure Disruption Attack (SDA), a powerful protection framework for safeguarding sensitive image regions against inpainting-based editing. Building upon the contour-focused nature of self-attention mechanisms of diffusion models, SDA optimizes perturbations by disrupting queries in self-attention during the initial denoising step to destroy the contour generation process. This targeted interference directly disrupts the structural generation capability of diffusion models, effectively preventing them from producing coherent images. We validate our motivation through visualization techniques and extensive experiments on public datasets, demonstrating that SDA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) protection performance while maintaining strong robustness.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Effectively modeling and utilizing spatiotemporal features from RGB and other modalities (\eg, depth, thermal, and event data, denoted as X) is the core of RGB-X tracker design. Existing methods often employ two parallel branches to separately process the RGB and X input streams, requiring the model to simultaneously handle two dispersed feature spaces, which complicates both the model structure and computation process. More critically, intra-modality spatial modeling within each dispersed space incurs substantial computational overhead, limiting resources for inter-modality spatial modeling and temporal modeling. To address this, we propose a novel tracker, CSTrack, which focuses on modeling Compact Spatiotemporal features to achieve simple yet effective tracking. Specifically, we first introduce an innovative Spatial Compact Module that integrates the RGB-X dual input streams into a compact spatial feature, enabling thorough intra- and inter-modality spatial modeling. Additionally, we design an efficient Temporal Compact Module that compactly represents temporal features by constructing the refined target distribution heatmap. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our compact spatiotemporal modeling method, with CSTrack achieving new SOTA results on mainstream RGB-X benchmarks. The code and models will be released at: https://github.com/XiaokunFeng/CSTrack.



### A Contrastive Learning Foundation Model Based on Perfectly Aligned Sample Pairs for Remote Sensing Images

- **Summary**: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL) methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically, PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks to augmented images rather than random cropping. With disjoint masks, we divide patches from different views into different parts that are semantically aligned but inconsistent in appearance. Our framework provides high-quality features by ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its sparse inputs. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, which verified the superiority of our method. We hope this work will contribute to practical remote sensing interpretation works.

- **Summary**: Continual Visual Question Answering (CVQA) based on pre-trained models(PTMs) has achieved promising progress by leveraging prompt tuning to enable continual multi-modal learning. However, most existing methods adopt cross-modal prompt isolation, constructing visual and textual prompts separately, which exacerbates modality imbalance and leads to degraded performance over time. To tackle this issue, we propose MM-Prompt, a novel framework incorporating cross-modal prompt query and cross-modal prompt recovery. The former enables balanced prompt selection by incorporating cross-modal signals during query formation, while the latter promotes joint prompt reconstruction through iterative cross-modal interactions, guided by an alignment loss to prevent representational drift. Extensive experiments show that MM-Prompt surpasses prior approaches in accuracy and knowledge retention, while maintaining balanced modality engagement throughout continual learning.

- **Summary**: Dataset distillation enables the training of deep neural networks with comparable performance in significantly reduced time by compressing large datasets into small and representative ones. Although the introduction of generative models has made great achievements in this field, the distributions of their distilled datasets are not diverse enough to represent the original ones, leading to a decrease in downstream validation accuracy. In this paper, we present a diversity-driven generative dataset distillation method based on a diffusion model to solve this problem. We introduce self-adaptive memory to align the distribution between distilled and real datasets, assessing the representativeness. The degree of alignment leads the diffusion model to generate more diverse datasets during the distillation process. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in most situations, proving its ability to tackle dataset distillation tasks.

- **Summary**: Over 8,024 wildfire incidents have been documented in 2024 alone, affecting thousands of fatalities and significant damage to infrastructure and ecosystems. Wildfires in the United States have inflicted devastating losses. Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense, which highlights how urgently efficient warning systems are needed to avoid disastrous outcomes. The goal of this study is to enhance the accuracy of wildfire detection by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on the VGG16 architecture. The D-FIRE dataset, which includes several kinds of wildfire and non-wildfire images, was employed in the study. Low-resolution images, dataset imbalance, and the necessity for real-time applicability are some of the main challenges. These problems were resolved by enriching the dataset using data augmentation techniques and optimizing the VGG16 model for binary classification. The model produced a low false negative rate, which is essential for reducing unexplored fires, despite dataset boundaries. In order to help authorities execute fast responses, this work shows that deep learning models such as VGG16 can offer a reliable, automated approach for early wildfire recognition. For the purpose of reducing the impact of wildfires, our future work will concentrate on connecting to systems with real-time surveillance networks and enlarging the dataset to cover more varied fire situations.

- **Summary**: Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with stereo depth estimation in rapidly changing scenes. In contrast, bio-inspired spike cameras emit asynchronous events at microsecond-level resolution, providing an alternative sensing modality. However, existing methods lack specialized stereo algorithms and benchmarks tailored to the spike data. To address this gap, we propose SpikeStereoNet, a brain-inspired framework and the first to estimate stereo depth directly from raw spike streams. The model fuses raw spike streams from two viewpoints and iteratively refines depth estimation through a recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) update module. To benchmark our approach, we introduce a large-scale synthetic spike stream dataset and a real-world stereo spike dataset with dense depth annotations. SpikeStereoNet outperforms existing methods on both datasets by leveraging spike streams' ability to capture subtle edges and intensity shifts in challenging regions such as textureless surfaces and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore, our framework exhibits strong data efficiency, maintaining high accuracy even with substantially reduced training data. The source code and datasets will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: 3D vector graphics play a crucial role in various applications including 3D shape retrieval, conceptual design, and virtual reality interactions due to their ability to capture essential structural information with minimal representation. While recent approaches have shown promise in generating 3D vector graphics, they often suffer from lengthy processing times and struggle to maintain view consistency. To address these limitations, we propose ViewCraft3D (VC3D), an efficient method that leverages 3D priors to generate 3D vector graphics. Specifically, our approach begins with 3D object analysis, employs a geometric extraction algorithm to fit 3D vector graphics to the underlying structure, and applies view-consistent refinement process to enhance visual quality. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VC3D outperforms previous methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, while significantly reducing computational overhead. The resulting 3D sketches maintain view consistency and effectively capture the essential characteristics of the original objects.

- **Summary**: Video action understanding tasks in real-world scenarios always suffer data limitations. In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot action recognition.



### Enhancing Visual Reliance in Text Generation: A Bayesian Perspective on Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually generate texts which satisfy context coherence but don't match the visual input. Such a hallucination issue hinders LVLMs' applicability in the real world. The key to solving hallucination in LVLM is to make the text generation rely more on the visual content. Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a specific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in LVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the visual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based on our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three aspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in generating meaningful texts. We propose to evaluate and remove redundant visual tokens to avoid their disturbance. Secondly, LVLM may encode inappropriate prior information, making it lean toward generating unexpected words. We propose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian perspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the posterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to a prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at all. Thus, we propose to stop further text generation to avoid hallucination. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks including POPE, CHAIR, and MME demonstrate that our method can consistently mitigate the hallucination issue of LVLM and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is the task of separating an image into albedo and shade. In real-world scenes, it is difficult to quantitatively assess IID quality due to the unavailability of ground truth. The existing method provides the relative reflection intensities based on human-judged annotations. However, these annotations have challenges in subjectivity, relative evaluation, and hue non-assessment. To address these, we propose a concept of quantitative evaluation with a calculated albedo from a hyperspectral imaging and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) intensity. Additionally, we introduce an optional albedo densification approach based on spectral similarity. This paper conducted a concept verification in a laboratory environment, and suggested the feasibility of an objective, absolute, and hue-aware assessment.

- **Summary**: Recent methods for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection typically leverage the generalization ability of large Vision-Language Model (VLM), i.e., CLIP, on unseen categories, showing impressive results on various zero-shot settings. However, existing methods struggle to adapt CLIP representations for human-object pairs, as CLIP tends to overlook fine-grained information necessary for distinguishing interactions. To address this issue, we devise, LAIN, a novel zero-shot HOI detection framework enhancing the locality and interaction awareness of CLIP representations. The locality awareness, which involves capturing fine-grained details and the spatial structure of individual objects, is achieved by aggregating the information and spatial priors of adjacent neighborhood patches. The interaction awareness, which involves identifying whether and how a human is interacting with an object, is achieved by capturing the interaction pattern between the human and the object. By infusing locality and interaction awareness into CLIP representation, LAIN captures detailed information about the human-object pairs. Our extensive experiments on existing benchmarks show that LAIN outperforms previous methods on various zero-shot settings, demonstrating the importance of locality and interaction awareness for effective zero-shot HOI detection.

- **Summary**: Multimodal machine translation (MMT) seeks to address the challenges posed by linguistic polysemy and ambiguity in translation tasks by incorporating visual information. A key bottleneck in current MMT research is the effective utilization of visual data. Previous approaches have focused on extracting global or region-level image features and using attention or gating mechanisms for multimodal information fusion. However, these methods have not adequately tackled the issue of visual information redundancy in MMT, nor have they proposed effective solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach--multimodal machine translation with visual Scene Graph Pruning (PSG), which leverages language scene graph information to guide the pruning of redundant nodes in visual scene graphs, thereby reducing noise in downstream translation tasks. Through extensive comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the PSG model. Our results also highlight the promising potential of visual information pruning in advancing the field of MMT.

- **Summary**: Intra-operative data captured during image-guided surgery lacks sub-surface information, where key regions of interest, such as vessels and tumors, reside. Image-to-physical registration enables the fusion of pre-operative information and intra-operative data, typically represented as a point cloud. However, this registration process struggles due to partial visibility of the intra-operative point cloud. In this research, we propose a patient-specific point cloud completion approach to assist with the registration process. Specifically, we leverage VN-OccNet to generate a complete liver surface from a partial intra-operative point cloud. The network is trained in a patient-specific manner, where simulated deformations from the pre-operative model are used to train the model. First, we conduct an in-depth analysis of VN-OccNet's rotation-equivariant property and its effectiveness in recovering complete surfaces from partial intra-operative surfaces. Next, we integrate the completed intra-operative surface into the Go-ICP registration algorithm to demonstrate its utility in improving initial rigid registration outcomes. Our results highlight the promise of this patient-specific completion approach in mitigating the challenges posed by partial intra-operative visibility. The rotation equivariant and surface generation capabilities of VN-OccNet hold strong promise for developing robust registration frameworks for variations of the intra-operative point cloud.

- **Summary**: Personalization using text-to-image diffusion models involves adapting a pretrained model to novel subjects with only a few image examples. This task presents a fundamental challenge, as the model must not only learn the new subject effectively but also preserve its ability to generate diverse and coherent outputs across a wide range of prompts. In other words, successful personalization requires integrating new concepts without forgetting previously learned generative capabilities. Forgetting denotes unintended distributional drift, where the model's output distribution deviates from that of the original pretrained model. In this paper, we provide an analysis of this issue and identify a mismatch between standard training objectives and the goals of personalization. To address this, we propose a new training objective based on a Lipschitz-bounded formulation that explicitly constrains deviation from the pretrained distribution. Our method provides improved control over distributional drift and performs well even in data-scarce scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing personalization methods, achieving higher CLIP-T, CLIP-I, and DINO scores.

- **Summary**: In recent years, image classification, as a core task in computer vision, relies on high-quality labelled data, which restricts the wide application of deep learning models in practical scenarios. To alleviate the problem of insufficient labelled samples, semi-supervised learning has gradually become a research hotspot. In this paper, we construct a semi-supervised image classification model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and through the introduction of the collaborative training mechanism of generators, discriminators and classifiers, we achieve the effective use of limited labelled data and a large amount of unlabelled data, improve the quality of image generation and classification accuracy, and provide an effective solution for the task of image recognition in complex environments.

- **Summary**: Text-driven video editing is rapidly advancing, yet its rigorous evaluation remains challenging due to the absence of dedicated video quality assessment (VQA) models capable of discerning the nuances of editing quality. To address this critical gap, we introduce TDVE-DB, a large-scale benchmark dataset for text-driven video editing. TDVE-DB consists of 3,857 edited videos generated from 12 diverse models across 8 editing categories, and is annotated with 173,565 human subjective ratings along three crucial dimensions, i.e., edited video quality, editing alignment, and structural consistency. Based on TDVE-DB, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation for the 12 state-of-the-art editing models revealing the strengths and weaknesses of current video techniques, and then benchmark existing VQA methods in the context of text-driven video editing evaluation. Building on these insights, we propose TDVE-Assessor, a novel VQA model specifically designed for text-driven video editing assessment. TDVE-Assessor integrates both spatial and temporal video features into a large language model (LLM) for rich contextual understanding to provide comprehensive quality assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDVE-Assessor substantially outperforms existing VQA models on TDVE-DB across all three evaluation dimensions, setting a new state-of-the-art. Both TDVE-DB and TDVE-Assessor will be released upon the publication.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration; and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x speed-up in the prefilling stage.

- **Summary**: Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as a promising solution to address distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. However, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive backpropagation during adaptation, limiting their applicability in real-world, time-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we introduce SMART-PC, a skeleton-based framework that enhances resilience to corruptions by leveraging the geometric structure of 3D point clouds. During pre-training, our method predicts skeletal representations, enabling the model to extract robust and meaningful geometric features that are less sensitive to corruptions, thereby improving adaptability to test-time distribution shifts. Unlike prior approaches, SMART-PC achieves real-time adaptation by eliminating backpropagation and updating only BatchNorm statistics, resulting in a lightweight and efficient framework capable of achieving high frame-per-second rates while maintaining superior classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including ModelNet40-C, ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C, demonstrate that SMART-PC achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing methods such as MATE in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/AliBahri94/SMART-PC.

- **Summary**: Time consumption and the complexity of manual layout design make automated layout generation a critical task, especially for multiple applications across different mobile devices. Existing graph-based layout generation approaches suffer from limited generative capability, often resulting in unreasonable and incompatible outputs. Meanwhile, vision based generative models tend to overlook the original structural information, leading to component intersections and overlaps. To address these challenges, we propose an Aggregation Structural Representation (ASR) module that integrates graph networks with large language models (LLMs) to preserve structural information while enhancing generative capability. This novel pipeline utilizes graph features as hierarchical prior knowledge, replacing the traditional Vision Transformer (ViT) module in multimodal large language models (MLLM) to predict full layout information for the first time. Moreover, the intermediate graph matrix used as input for the LLM is human editable, enabling progressive, human centric design generation. A comprehensive evaluation on the RICO dataset demonstrates the strong performance of ASR, both quantitatively using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and qualitatively through a crowdsourced user study. Additionally, sampling on relational features ensures diverse layout generation, further enhancing the adaptability and creativity of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Neural fields are now the central focus of research in 3D vision and computer graphics. Existing methods mainly focus on various scene representations, such as neural points and 3D Gaussians. However, few works have studied the rendering process to enhance the neural fields. In this work, we propose a plug-in method named K-Buffers that leverages multiple buffers to improve the rendering performance. Our method first renders K buffers from scene representations and constructs K pixel-wise feature maps. Then, We introduce a K-Feature Fusion Network (KFN) to merge the K pixel-wise feature maps. Finally, we adopt a feature decoder to generate the rendering image. We also introduce an acceleration strategy to improve rendering speed and quality. We apply our method to well-known radiance field baselines, including neural point fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the rendering performance of neural point fields and 3DGS.

- **Summary**: Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems have rapidly evolved to tackle incremental recognition challenges in operational settings. Data scarcity remains a major hurdle that conventional SAR-ATR techniques struggle to address. To cope with this challenge, we propose a few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) framework based on a dual-branch architecture that focuses on local feature extraction and leverages the discrete Fourier transform and global filters to capture long-term spatial dependencies. This incorporates a lightweight cross-attention mechanism that fuses domain-specific features with global dependencies to ensure robust feature interaction, while maintaining computational efficiency by introducing minimal scale-shift parameters. The framework combines focal loss for class distinction under imbalance and center loss for compact intra-class distributions to enhance class separation boundaries. Experimental results on the MSTAR benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in FSCIL SAR-ATR, attesting to its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Open vocabulary image segmentation tackles the challenge of recognizing dynamically adjustable, predefined novel categories at inference time by leveraging vision-language alignment. However, existing paradigms typically perform class-agnostic region segmentation followed by category matching, which deviates from the human visual system's process of recognizing objects based on semantic concepts, leading to poor alignment between region segmentation and target concepts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cognition-Inspired Framework for open vocabulary image segmentation that emulates the human visual recognition process: first forming a conceptual understanding of an object, then perceiving its spatial extent. The framework consists of three core components: (1) A Generative Vision-Language Model (G-VLM) that mimics human cognition by generating object concepts to provide semantic guidance for region segmentation. (2) A Concept-Aware Visual Enhancer Module that fuses textual concept features with global visual representations, enabling adaptive visual perception based on target concepts. (3) A Cognition-Inspired Decoder that integrates local instance features with G-VLM-provided semantic cues, allowing selective classification over a subset of relevant categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements, reaching $27.2$ PQ, $17.0$ mAP, and $35.3$ mIoU on A-150. It further attains $56.2$, $28.2$, $15.4$, $59.2$, $18.7$, and $95.8$ mIoU on Cityscapes, Mapillary Vistas, A-847, PC-59, PC-459, and PAS-20, respectively. In addition, our framework supports vocabulary-free segmentation, offering enhanced flexibility in recognizing unseen categories. Code will be public.

- **Summary**: While virtual try-on has achieved significant progress, evaluating these models towards real-world scenarios remains a challenge. A comprehensive benchmark is essential for three key reasons:(1) Current metrics inadequately reflect human perception, particularly in unpaired try-on settings;(2)Most existing test sets are limited to indoor scenarios, lacking complexity for real-world evaluation; and (3) An ideal system should guide future advancements in virtual try-on generation. To address these needs, we introduce VTBench, a hierarchical benchmark suite that systematically decomposes virtual image try-on into hierarchical, disentangled dimensions, each equipped with tailored test sets and evaluation criteria. VTBench exhibits three key advantages:1) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework: The benchmark encompasses five critical dimensions for virtual try-on generation (e.g., overall image quality, texture preservation, complex background consistency, cross-category size adaptability, and hand-occlusion handling). Granular evaluation metrics of corresponding test sets pinpoint model capabilities and limitations across diverse, challenging scenarios.2) Human Alignment: Human preference annotations are provided for each test set, ensuring the benchmark's alignment with perceptual quality across all evaluation dimensions. (3) Valuable Insights: Beyond standard indoor settings, we analyze model performance variations across dimensions and investigate the disparity between indoor and real-world try-on scenarios. To foster the field of virtual try-on towards challenging real-world scenario, VTBench will be open-sourced, including all test sets, evaluation protocols, generated results, and human annotations.

- **Summary**: Securing personal identity against deepfake attacks is increasingly critical in the digital age, especially for celebrities and political figures whose faces are easily accessible and frequently targeted. Most existing deepfake detection methods focus on general-purpose scenarios and often ignore the valuable prior knowledge of known facial identities, e.g., "VIP individuals" whose authentic facial data are already available. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VIPGuard}, a unified multimodal framework designed to capture fine-grained and comprehensive facial representations of a given identity, compare them against potentially fake or similar-looking faces, and reason over these comparisons to make accurate and explainable predictions. Specifically, our framework consists of three main stages. First, fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to learn detailed and structural facial attributes. Second, we perform identity-level discriminative learning to enable the model to distinguish subtle differences between highly similar faces, including real and fake variations. Finally, we introduce user-specific customization, where we model the unique characteristics of the target face identity and perform semantic reasoning via MLLM to enable personalized and explainable deepfake detection. Our framework shows clear advantages over previous detection works, where traditional detectors mainly rely on low-level visual cues and provide no human-understandable explanations, while other MLLM-based models often lack a detailed understanding of specific face identities. To facilitate the evaluation of our method, we built a comprehensive identity-aware benchmark called \textbf{VIPBench} for personalized deepfake detection, involving the latest 7 face-swapping and 7 entire face synthesis techniques for generation.

- **Summary**: Ratio-based biomarkers -- such as the proportion of necrotic tissue within a tumor -- are widely used in clinical practice to support diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning. These biomarkers are typically estimated from soft segmentation outputs by computing region-wise ratios. Despite the high-stakes nature of clinical decision making, existing methods provide only point estimates, offering no measure of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a unified \textit{confidence-aware} framework for estimating ratio-based biomarkers. We conduct a systematic analysis of error propagation in the segmentation-to-biomarker pipeline and identify model miscalibration as the dominant source of uncertainty. To mitigate this, we incorporate a lightweight, post-hoc calibration module that can be applied using internal hospital data without retraining. We leverage a tunable parameter $Q$ to control the confidence level of the derived bounds, allowing adaptation towards clinical practice. Extensive experiments show that our method produces statistically sound confidence intervals, with tunable confidence levels, enabling more trustworthy application of predictive biomarkers in clinical workflows.

- **Summary**: Conformal prediction (CP) provides a framework for constructing prediction sets with guaranteed coverage, assuming exchangeable data. However, real-world scenarios often involve distribution shifts that violate exchangeability, leading to unreliable coverage and inflated prediction sets. To address this challenge, we first introduce Reconstruction Loss-Scaled Conformal Prediction (RLSCP), which utilizes reconstruction losses derived from a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as an uncertainty metric to scale score functions. While RLSCP demonstrates performance improvements, mainly resulting in better coverage, it quantifies quantiles based on a fixed calibration dataset without considering the discrepancies between test and train datasets in an unexchangeable setting. In the next step, we propose Weighted Quantile Loss-scaled Conformal Prediction (WQLCP), which refines RLSCP by incorporating a weighted notion of exchangeability, adjusting the calibration quantile threshold based on weights with respect to the ratio of calibration and test loss values. This approach improves the CP-generated prediction set outputs in the presence of distribution shifts. Experiments on large-scale datasets, including ImageNet variants, demonstrate that WQLCP outperforms existing baselines by consistently maintaining coverage while reducing prediction set sizes, providing a robust solution for CP under distribution shifts.

- **Summary**: In contrast to vision transformers, which model long-range dependencies through global self-attention, large kernel convolutions provide a more efficient and scalable alternative, particularly in high-resolution 3D volumetric settings. However, naively increasing kernel size often leads to optimization instability and degradation in performance. Motivated by the spatial bias observed in effective receptive fields (ERFs), we hypothesize that different kernel elements converge at variable rates during training. To support this, we derive a theoretical connection between element-wise gradients and first-order optimization, showing that structurally re-parameterized convolution blocks inherently induce spatially varying learning rates. Building on this insight, we introduce Rep3D, a 3D convolutional framework that incorporates a learnable spatial prior into large kernel training. A lightweight two-stage modulation network generates a receptive-biased scaling mask, adaptively re-weighting kernel updates and enabling local-to-global convergence behavior. Rep3D adopts a plain encoder design with large depthwise convolutions, avoiding the architectural complexity of multi-branch compositions. We evaluate Rep3D on five challenging 3D segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, including transformer-based and fixed-prior re-parameterization methods. By unifying spatial inductive bias with optimization-aware learning, Rep3D offers an interpretable, and scalable solution for 3D medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive performance, yet the integration of powerful vision encoders has significantly broadened their attack surface, rendering them increasingly susceptible to jailbreak attacks. However, lacking well-defined attack objectives, existing jailbreak methods often struggle with gradient-based strategies prone to local optima and lacking precise directional guidance, and typically decouple visual and textual modalities, thereby limiting their effectiveness by neglecting crucial cross-modal interactions. Inspired by the Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK) framework, we posit that VLMs encode safety-relevant information within their internal fusion-layer representations, revealing an implicit safety decision boundary in the latent space. This motivates exploiting boundary to steer model behavior. Accordingly, we propose JailBound, a novel latent space jailbreak framework comprising two stages: (1) Safety Boundary Probing, which addresses the guidance issue by approximating decision boundary within fusion layer's latent space, thereby identifying optimal perturbation directions towards the target region; and (2) Safety Boundary Crossing, which overcomes the limitations of decoupled approaches by jointly optimizing adversarial perturbations across both image and text inputs. This latter stage employs an innovative mechanism to steer the model's internal state towards policy-violating outputs while maintaining cross-modal semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on six diverse VLMs demonstrate JailBound's efficacy, achieves 94.32% white-box and 67.28% black-box attack success averagely, which are 6.17% and 21.13% higher than SOTA methods, respectively. Our findings expose a overlooked safety risk in VLMs and highlight the urgent need for more robust defenses. Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive, harmful and offensive content.

- **Summary**: Current multi-modal models exhibit a notable misalignment with the human visual system when identifying objects that are visually assimilated into the background. Our observations reveal that these multi-modal models cannot distinguish concealed objects, demonstrating an inability to emulate human cognitive processes which effectively utilize foreground-background similarity principles for visual analysis. To analyze this hidden human-model visual thinking discrepancy, we build a visual system that mimicks human visual camouflaged perception to progressively and iteratively `refocus' visual concealed content. The refocus is a progressive guidance mechanism enabling models to logically localize objects in visual images through stepwise reasoning. The localization process of concealed objects requires hierarchical attention shifting with dynamic adjustment and refinement of prior cognitive knowledge. In this paper, we propose a visual refocus reinforcement framework via the policy optimization algorithm to encourage multi-modal models to think and refocus more before answering, and achieve excellent reasoning abilities to align and even surpass human camouflaged perception systems. Our extensive experiments on camouflaged perception successfully demonstrate the emergence of refocus visual phenomena, characterized by multiple reasoning tokens and dynamic adjustment of the detection box. Besides, experimental results on both camouflaged object classification and detection tasks exhibit significantly superior performance compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) baselines.

- **Summary**: Adversarial transferability remains a critical challenge in evaluating the robustness of deep neural networks. In security-critical applications, transferability enables black-box attacks without access to model internals, making it a key concern for real-world adversarial threat assessment. While Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong adversarial performance, existing attacks often fail to transfer effectively across architectures, especially from ViTs to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or hybrid models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TESSER} -- a novel adversarial attack framework that enhances transferability via two key strategies: (1) \textit{Feature-Sensitive Gradient Scaling (FSGS)}, which modulates gradients based on token-wise importance derived from intermediate feature activations, and (2) \textit{Spectral Smoothness Regularization (SSR)}, which suppresses high-frequency noise in perturbations using a differentiable Gaussian prior. These components work in tandem to generate perturbations that are both semantically meaningful and spectrally smooth. Extensive experiments on ImageNet across 12 diverse architectures demonstrate that TESSER achieves +10.9\% higher attack succes rate (ASR) on CNNs and +7.2\% on ViTs compared to the state-of-the-art Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT) method. Moreover, TESSER significantly improves robustness against defended models, achieving 53.55\% ASR on adversarially trained CNNs. Qualitative analysis shows strong alignment between TESSER's perturbations and salient visual regions identified via Grad-CAM, while frequency-domain analysis reveals a 12\% reduction in high-frequency energy, confirming the effectiveness of spectral regularization.

- **Summary**: Multimodal learning has seen remarkable progress, particularly with the emergence of large-scale pre-training across various modalities. However, most current approaches are built on the assumption of a deterministic, one-to-one alignment between modalities. This oversimplifies real-world multimodal relationships, where their nature is inherently many-to-many. This phenomenon, named multiplicity, is not a side-effect of noise or annotation error, but an inevitable outcome of semantic abstraction, representational asymmetry, and task-dependent ambiguity in multimodal tasks. This position paper argues that multiplicity is a fundamental bottleneck that manifests across all stages of the multimodal learning pipeline: from data construction to training and evaluation. This paper examines the causes and consequences of multiplicity, and highlights how multiplicity introduces training uncertainty, unreliable evaluation, and low dataset quality. This position calls for new research directions on multimodal learning: novel multiplicity-aware learning frameworks and dataset construction protocols considering multiplicity.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing task-relevant from irrelevant signals, particularly in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality Competency Problem: the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities. This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks such as image classification or pure text question answering, where models are expected to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem. We further design a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to fine-tune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations via Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and a consistency regularization strategy applied to model outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy, and VQA tasks) and multiple model families with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised image denoising methods have garnered significant research attention in recent years, for this kind of method reduces the requirement of large training datasets. Compared to supervised methods, self-supervised methods rely more on the prior embedded in deep networks themselves. As a result, most of the self-supervised methods are designed with Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures, which well capture one of the most important image prior, translation equivariant prior. Inspired by the great success achieved by the introduction of translational equivariance, in this paper, we explore the way to further incorporate another important image prior. Specifically, we first apply high-accuracy rotation equivariant convolution to self-supervised image denoising. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we have proved that simply replacing all the convolution layers with rotation equivariant convolution layers would modify the network into its rotation equivariant version. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that rotation equivariant image prior is introduced to self-supervised image denoising at the network architecture level with a comprehensive theoretical analysis of equivariance errors, which offers a new perspective to the field of self-supervised image denoising. Moreover, to further improve the performance, we design a new mask mechanism to fusion the output of rotation equivariant network and vanilla CNN-based network, and construct an adaptive rotation equivariant framework. Through extensive experiments on three typical methods, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Purpose: To develop a bilingual multimodal visual question answering (VQA) benchmark for evaluating VLMs in ophthalmology. Methods: Ophthalmic image posts and associated captions published between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2024, were collected from WeChat Official Accounts. Based on these captions, bilingual question-answer (QA) pairs in Chinese and English were generated using GPT-4o-mini. QA pairs were categorized into six subsets by question type and language: binary (Binary_CN, Binary_EN), single-choice (Single-choice_CN, Single-choice_EN), and open-ended (Open-ended_CN, Open-ended_EN). The benchmark was used to evaluate the performance of three VLMs: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct. Results: The final OphthalWeChat dataset included 3,469 images and 30,120 QA pairs across 9 ophthalmic subspecialties, 548 conditions, 29 imaging modalities, and 68 modality combinations. Gemini 2.0 Flash achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.548), outperforming GPT-4o (0.522, P < 0.001) and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct (0.514, P < 0.001). It also led in both Chinese (0.546) and English subsets (0.550). Subset-specific performance showed Gemini 2.0 Flash excelled in Binary_CN (0.687), Single-choice_CN (0.666), and Single-choice_EN (0.646), while GPT-4o ranked highest in Binary_EN (0.717), Open-ended_CN (BLEU-1: 0.301; BERTScore: 0.382), and Open-ended_EN (BLEU-1: 0.183; BERTScore: 0.240). Conclusions: This study presents the first bilingual VQA benchmark for ophthalmology, distinguished by its real-world context and inclusion of multiple examinations per patient. The dataset reflects authentic clinical decision-making scenarios and enables quantitative evaluation of VLMs, supporting the development of accurate, specialized, and trustworthy AI systems for eye care.

- **Summary**: Virtual try-on technology has become increasingly important in the fashion and retail industries, enabling the generation of high-fidelity garment images that adapt seamlessly to target human models. While existing methods have achieved notable progress, they still face significant challenges in maintaining consistency across different poses. Specifically, geometric distortions lead to a lack of spatial consistency, mismatches in garment structure and texture across poses result in semantic inconsistency, and the loss or distortion of fine-grained details diminishes visual fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose HF-VTON, a novel framework that ensures high-fidelity virtual try-on performance across diverse poses. HF-VTON consists of three key modules: (1) the Appearance-Preserving Warp Alignment Module (APWAM), which aligns garments to human poses, addressing geometric deformations and ensuring spatial consistency; (2) the Semantic Representation and Comprehension Module (SRCM), which captures fine-grained garment attributes and multi-pose data to enhance semantic representation, maintaining structural, textural, and pattern consistency; and (3) the Multimodal Prior-Guided Appearance Generation Module (MPAGM), which integrates multimodal features and prior knowledge from pre-trained models to optimize appearance generation, ensuring both semantic and geometric consistency. Additionally, to overcome data limitations in existing benchmarks, we introduce the SAMP-VTONS dataset, featuring multi-pose pairs and rich textual annotations for a more comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that HF-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both VITON-HD and SAMP-VTONS, excelling in visual fidelity, semantic consistency, and detail preservation.

- **Summary**: Multimodal information retrieval (MIR) faces inherent challenges due to the heterogeneity of data sources and the complexity of cross-modal alignment. While previous studies have identified modal gaps in feature spaces, a systematic approach to address these challenges remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce UNITE, a universal framework that tackles these challenges through two critical yet underexplored aspects: data curation and modality-aware training configurations. Our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of how modality-specific data properties influence downstream task performance across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we propose Modal-Aware Masked Contrastive Learning (MAMCL) to mitigate the competitive relationships among the instances of different modalities. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by notable margins. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that strategic modality curation and tailored training protocols are pivotal for robust cross-modal representation learning. This work not only advances MIR performance but also provides a foundational blueprint for future research in multimodal systems.

- **Summary**: Discrete diffusion models are gaining traction in the visual generative area for their efficiency and compatibility. However, the pioneered attempts still fall behind the continuous counterparts, which we attribute to the noise (absorbing state) design and sampling heuristics. In this study, we propose the rehashing noise framework for discrete diffusion transformer, termed ReDDiT, to extend absorbing states and improve expressive capacity of discrete diffusion models. ReDDiT enriches the potential paths that latent variables can traverse during training with randomized multi-index corruption. The derived rehash sampler, which reverses the randomized absorbing paths, guarantees the diversity and low discrepancy of the generation process. These reformulations lead to more consistent and competitive generation quality, mitigating the need for heavily tuned randomness. Experiments show that ReDDiT significantly outperforms the baseline (reducing gFID from 6.18 to 1.61) and is on par with the continuous counterparts with higher efficiency.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation models often struggle to generalize across different domains due to various reasons. Domain Generalization (DG) methods overcome this either through representation learning or data augmentation (DAug). While representation learning methods seek domain-invariant features, they often rely on ad-hoc techniques and lack formal guarantees. DAug methods, which enrich model representations through synthetic samples, have shown comparable or superior performance to representation learning approaches. We propose LangDAug, a novel $\textbf{Lang}$evin $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{Aug}$mentation for multi-source domain generalization in 2D medical image segmentation. LangDAug leverages Energy-Based Models (EBMs) trained via contrastive divergence to traverse between source domains, generating intermediate samples through Langevin dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that LangDAug induces a regularization effect, and for GLMs, it upper-bounds the Rademacher complexity by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold. Through extensive experiments on Fundus segmentation and 2D MRI prostate segmentation benchmarks, we show that LangDAug outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization methods and effectively complements existing domain-randomization approaches. The codebase for our method is available at https://github.com/backpropagator/LangDAug.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes FieldWorkArena, a benchmark for agentic AI targeting real-world field work. With the recent increase in demand for agentic AI, they are required to monitor and report safety and health incidents, as well as manufacturing-related incidents, that may occur in real-world work environments. Existing agentic AI benchmarks have been limited to evaluating web tasks and are insufficient for evaluating agents in real-world work environments, where complexity increases significantly. In this paper, we define a new action space that agentic AI should possess for real world work environment benchmarks and improve the evaluation function from previous methods to assess the performance of agentic AI in diverse real-world tasks. The dataset consists of videos captured on-site and documents actually used in factories and warehouses, and tasks were created based on interviews with on-site workers and managers.

- **Summary**: Multi-image super-resolution (MISR) can achieve higher image quality than single-image super-resolution (SISR) by aggregating sub-pixel information from multiple spatially shifted frames. Among MISR tasks, burst super-resolution (BurstSR) has gained significant attention due to its wide range of applications. Recent methods have increasingly adopted Transformers over convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in super-resolution tasks, due to their superior ability to capture both local and global context. However, most existing approaches still rely on fixed and narrow attention windows that restrict the perception of features beyond the local field. This limitation hampers alignment and feature aggregation, both of which are crucial for high-quality super-resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a novel feature extractor that incorporates two newly designed attention mechanisms: overlapping cross-window attention and cross-frame attention, enabling more precise and efficient extraction of sub-pixel information across multiple frames. Furthermore, we introduce a Multi-scan State-Space Module with the cross-frame attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Additional evaluations on ISO 12233 resolution test charts further confirm its enhanced super-resolution performance.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations, where generated responses seem semantically plausible yet exhibit little or no relevance to the input image. Previous studies reveal that this issue primarily stems from LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors while disregarding the visual information during decoding. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a novel Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) calibrated decoding strategy, which adaptively strengthens the mutual dependency between generated texts and input images to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing methods solely focusing on text token sampling, we propose to jointly model the contributions of visual and textual tokens to C-PMI, formulating hallucination mitigation as a bi-level optimization problem aimed at maximizing mutual information. To solve it, we design a token purification mechanism that dynamically regulates the decoding process by sampling text tokens remaining maximally relevant to the given image, while simultaneously refining image tokens most pertinent to the generated response. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks reveal that the proposed method significantly reduces hallucinations in LVLMs while preserving decoding efficiency.

- **Summary**: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLRMs) has enabled sophisticated visual reasoning capabilities by integrating reinforcement learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. However, while these enhanced reasoning capabilities improve performance, they also introduce new and underexplored safety risks. In this work, we systematically investigate the security implications of advanced visual reasoning in MLRMs. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: as visual reasoning improves, models become more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Motivated by this critical finding, we introduce VisCRA (Visual Chain Reasoning Attack), a novel jailbreak framework that exploits the visual reasoning chains to bypass safety mechanisms. VisCRA combines targeted visual attention masking with a two-stage reasoning induction strategy to precisely control harmful outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate VisCRA's significant effectiveness, achieving high attack success rates on leading closed-source MLRMs: 76.48% on Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, 68.56% on QvQ-Max, and 56.60% on GPT-4o. Our findings highlight a critical insight: the very capability that empowers MLRMs -- their visual reasoning -- can also serve as an attack vector, posing significant security risks.

- **Summary**: Camera sensor simulation serves as a critical role for autonomous driving (AD), e.g. evaluating vision-based AD algorithms. While existing approaches have leveraged generative models for controllable image/video generation, they remain constrained to generating multi-view video sequences with fixed camera viewpoints and video frequency, significantly limiting their downstream applications. To address this, we present a generalizable camera simulation framework DriveCamSim, whose core innovation lies in the proposed Explicit Camera Modeling (ECM) mechanism. Instead of implicit interaction through vanilla attention, ECM establishes explicit pixel-wise correspondences across multi-view and multi-frame dimensions, decoupling the model from overfitting to the specific camera configurations (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, number of views) and temporal sampling rates presented in the training data. For controllable generation, we identify the issue of information loss inherent in existing conditional encoding and injection pipelines, proposing an information-preserving control mechanism. This control mechanism not only improves conditional controllability, but also can be extended to be identity-aware to enhance temporal consistency in foreground object rendering. With above designs, our model demonstrates superior performance in both visual quality and controllability, as well as generalization capability across spatial-level (camera parameters variations) and temporal-level (video frame rate variations), enabling flexible user-customizable camera simulation tailored to diverse application scenarios. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/swc-17/DriveCamSim for facilitating future research.

- **Summary**: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is a critical yet challenging task aimed at inferring emotional states of individuals based on visual cues. However, existing works focus on single domains, e.g., realistic images or stickers, limiting VER models' cross-domain generalizability. To fill this gap, we introduce an Unsupervised Cross-Domain Visual Emotion Recognition (UCDVER) task, which aims to generalize visual emotion recognition from the source domain (e.g., realistic images) to the low-resource target domain (e.g., stickers) in an unsupervised manner. Compared to the conventional unsupervised domain adaptation problems, UCDVER presents two key challenges: a significant emotional expression variability and an affective distribution shift. To mitigate these issues, we propose the Knowledge-aligned Counterfactual-enhancement Diffusion Perception (KCDP) framework. Specifically, KCDP leverages a VLM to align emotional representations in a shared knowledge space and guides diffusion models for improved visual affective perception. Furthermore, a Counterfactual-Enhanced Language-image Emotional Alignment (CLIEA) method generates high-quality pseudo-labels for the target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses SOTA models in both perceptibility and generalization, e.g., gaining 12% improvements over the SOTA VER model TGCA-PVT.

### Modeling Beyond MOS: Quality Assessment Models Must Integrate Context, Reasoning, and Multimodality

- **Summary**: This position paper argues that Mean Opinion Score (MOS), while historically foundational, is no longer sufficient as the sole supervisory signal for multimedia quality assessment models. MOS reduces rich, context-sensitive human judgments to a single scalar, obscuring semantic failures, user intent, and the rationale behind quality decisions. We contend that modern quality assessment models must integrate three interdependent capabilities: (1) context-awareness, to adapt evaluations to task-specific goals and viewing conditions; (2) reasoning, to produce interpretable, evidence-grounded justifications for quality judgments; and (3) multimodality, to align perceptual and semantic cues using vision-language models. We critique the limitations of current MOS-centric benchmarks and propose a roadmap for reform: richer datasets with contextual metadata and expert rationales, and new evaluation metrics that assess semantic alignment, reasoning fidelity, and contextual sensitivity. By reframing quality assessment as a contextual, explainable, and multimodal modeling task, we aim to catalyze a shift toward more robust, human-aligned, and trustworthy evaluation systems.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large language models have significantly improved textual reasoning through the effective use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning. However, extending these successes to vision-language tasks remains challenging due to inherent limitations in text-only CoT, such as visual hallucinations and insufficient multimodal integration. In this paper, we introduce Point-RFT, a multimodal reasoning framework explicitly designed to leverage visually grounded CoT reasoning for visual document understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: First, we conduct format finetuning using a curated dataset of 71K diverse visual reasoning problems, each annotated with detailed, step-by-step rationales explicitly grounded to corresponding visual elements. Second, we employ reinforcement finetuning targeting visual document understanding. On ChartQA, our approach improves accuracy from 70.88% (format-finetuned baseline) to 90.04%, surpassing the 83.92% accuracy achieved by reinforcement finetuning relying solely on text-based CoT. The result shows that our grounded CoT is more effective for multimodal reasoning compared with the text-only CoT. Moreover, Point-RFT exhibits superior generalization capability across several out-of-domain visual document reasoning benchmarks, including CharXiv, PlotQA, IconQA, TabMWP, etc., and highlights its potential in complex real-world scenarios.



### MLLM-Guided VLM Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval

- **Summary**: Existing Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) methods typically train adapters that convert reference images into pseudo-text tokens, which are concatenated with the modifying text and processed by frozen text encoders in pretrained VLMs or LLMs. While this design leverages the strengths of large pretrained models, it only supervises the adapter to produce encoder-compatible tokens that loosely preserve visual semantics. Crucially, it does not directly optimize the composed query representation to capture the full intent of the composition or to align with the target semantics, thereby limiting retrieval performance, particularly in cases involving fine-grained or complex visual transformations. To address this problem, we propose MLLM-Guided VLM Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference (MVFT-JI), a novel approach that leverages a pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) to construct two complementary training tasks using only unlabeled images: target text retrieval taskand text-to-image retrieval task. By jointly optimizing these tasks, our method enables the VLM to inherently acquire robust compositional retrieval capabilities, supported by the provided theoretical justifications and empirical validation. Furthermore, during inference, we further prompt the MLLM to generate target texts from composed queries and compute retrieval scores by integrating similarities between (i) the composed query and candidate images, and (ii) the MLLM-generated target text and candidate images. This strategy effectively combines the VLM's semantic alignment strengths with the MLLM's reasoning capabilities.

- **Summary**: Accurately delineating the visual pathway (VP) is crucial for understanding the human visual system and diagnosing related disorders. Exploring multi-parametric MR imaging data has been identified as an important way to delineate VP. However, due to the complex cross-sequence relationships, existing methods cannot effectively model the complementary information from different MRI sequences. In addition, these existing methods heavily rely on large training data with labels, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming to obtain. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-parametric feature decomposition framework for VP delineation. Specifically, a correlation-constrained feature decomposition (CFD) is designed to handle the complex cross-sequence relationships by capturing the unique characteristics of each MRI sequence and easing the multi-parametric information fusion process. Furthermore, a consistency-based sample enhancement (CSE) module is developed to address the limited labeled data issue, by generating and promoting meaningful edge information from unlabeled data. We validate our framework using two public datasets, and one in-house Multi-Shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of delineation performance when compared to seven state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Human-centered images often suffer from severe generic degradation during transmission and are prone to human motion blur (HMB), making restoration challenging. Existing research lacks sufficient focus on these issues, as both problems often coexist in practice. To address this, we design a degradation pipeline that simulates the coexistence of HMB and generic noise, generating synthetic degraded data to train our proposed HAODiff, a human-aware one-step diffusion. Specifically, we propose a triple-branch dual-prompt guidance (DPG), which leverages high-quality images, residual noise (LQ minus HQ), and HMB segmentation masks as training targets. It produces a positive-negative prompt pair for classifier-free guidance (CFG) in a single diffusion step. The resulting adaptive dual prompts let HAODiff exploit CFG more effectively, boosting robustness against diverse degradations. For fair evaluation, we introduce MPII-Test, a benchmark rich in combined noise and HMB cases. Extensive experiments show that our HAODiff surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality on synthetic and real-world datasets, including our introduced MPII-Test.

- **Summary**: Accurate identification of acute cellular rejection (ACR) in endomyocardial biopsies is essential for effective management of heart transplant patients. However, the rarity of high-grade rejection cases (3R) presents a significant challenge for training robust deep learning models. This work addresses the class imbalance problem by leveraging synthetic data generation using StyleGAN to augment the limited number of real 3R images. Prior to GAN training, histogram equalization was applied to standardize image appearance and improve the consistency of tissue representation. StyleGAN was trained on available 3R biopsy patches and subsequently used to generate 10,000 realistic synthetic images. These were combined with real 0R samples, that is samples without rejection, in various configurations to train ResNet-18 classifiers for binary rejection classification.   Three classifier variants were evaluated: one trained on real 0R and synthetic 3R images, another using both synthetic and additional real samples, and a third trained solely on real data. All models were tested on an independent set of real biopsy images. Results demonstrate that synthetic data improves classification performance, particularly when used in combination with real samples. The highest-performing model, which used both real and synthetic images, achieved strong precision and recall for both classes. These findings underscore the value of hybrid training strategies and highlight the potential of GAN-based data augmentation in biomedical image analysis, especially in domains constrained by limited annotated datasets.

- **Summary**: In this technical report, we present our solution to the CVPR 2025 Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) 3.0 Workshop Challenge Track 1: Adapt & Detect: Robust Anomaly Detection in Real-World Applications. In real-world industrial anomaly detection, it is crucial to accurately identify anomalies with physical complexity, such as transparent or reflective surfaces, occlusions, and low-contrast contaminations. The recently proposed MVTec AD 2 dataset significantly narrows the gap between publicly available benchmarks and anomalies found in real-world industrial environments. To address the challenges posed by this dataset--such as complex and varying lighting conditions and real anomalies with large scale differences--we propose a fully training-free anomaly detection and segmentation method based on feature extraction using the DINOv2 model named SuperAD. Our method carefully selects a small number of normal reference images and constructs a memory bank by leveraging the strong representational power of DINOv2. Anomalies are then segmented by performing nearest neighbor matching between test image features and the memory bank. Our method achieves competitive results on both test sets of the MVTec AD 2 dataset.

- **Summary**: Intrinsic image decomposition aims at separating an image into its underlying albedo and shading components, isolating the base color from lighting effects to enable downstream applications such as virtual relighting and scene editing. Despite the rise and success of learning-based approaches, intrinsic image decomposition from real-world images remains a significant challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled ground-truth data. Most existing solutions rely on synthetic data as supervised setups, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world scenes. Self-supervised methods, on the other hand, often produce albedo maps that contain reflections and lack consistency under different lighting conditions. To address this, we propose SAIL, an approach designed to estimate albedo-like representations from single-view real-world images. We repurpose the prior knowledge of a latent diffusion model for unconditioned scene relighting as a surrogate objective for albedo estimation. To extract the albedo, we introduce a novel intrinsic image decomposition fully formulated in the latent space. To guide the training of our latent diffusion model, we introduce regularization terms that constrain both the lighting-dependent and independent components of our latent image decomposition. SAIL predicts stable albedo under varying lighting conditions and generalizes to multiple scenes, using only unlabeled multi-illumination data available online.

- **Summary**: Using massive datasets, foundation models are large-scale, pre-trained models that perform a wide range of tasks. These models have shown consistently improved results with the introduction of new methods. It is crucial to analyze how these trends impact the medical field and determine whether these advancements can drive meaningful change. This study investigates the application of recent state-of-the-art foundation models, DINOv2, MAE, VMamba, CoCa, SAM2, and AIMv2, for medical image classification. We explore their effectiveness on datasets including CBIS-DDSM for mammography, ISIC2019 for skin lesions, APTOS2019 for diabetic retinopathy, and CHEXPERT for chest radiographs. By fine-tuning these models and evaluating their configurations, we aim to understand the potential of these advancements in medical image classification. The results indicate that these advanced models significantly enhance classification outcomes, demonstrating robust performance despite limited labeled data. Based on our results, AIMv2, DINOv2, and SAM2 models outperformed others, demonstrating that progress in natural domain training has positively impacted the medical domain and improved classification outcomes.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in generalizable novel view synthesis have achieved impressive quality through interpolation between nearby views. However, rendering high-resolution images remains computationally intensive due to the need for dense sampling of all rays. Recognizing that natural scenes are typically piecewise smooth and sampling all rays is often redundant, we propose a novel depth-guided bundle sampling strategy to accelerate rendering. By grouping adjacent rays into a bundle and sampling them collectively, a shared representation is generated for decoding all rays within the bundle. To further optimize efficiency, our adaptive sampling strategy dynamically allocates samples based on depth confidence, concentrating more samples in complex regions while reducing them in smoother areas. When applied to ENeRF, our method achieves up to a 1.27 dB PSNR improvement and a 47% increase in FPS on the DTU dataset. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering quality and up to 2x faster rendering compared to existing generalizable methods.

- **Summary**: Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4 mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Equivariant and invariant deep learning models have been developed to exploit intrinsic symmetries in data, demonstrating significant effectiveness in certain scenarios. However, these methods often suffer from limited representation accuracy and rely on strict symmetry assumptions that may not hold in practice. These limitations pose a significant drawback for image restoration tasks, which demands high accuracy and precise symmetry representation. To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework. Our approach firstly enables a non-strictly equivariant network suitable for image restoration, providing a simple and adaptive mechanism for adjusting equivariance based on task. Extensive experiments across three low-level tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization capability of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Understanding pain-related facial behaviors is essential for digital healthcare in terms of effective monitoring, assisted diagnostics, and treatment planning, particularly for patients unable to communicate verbally. Existing data-driven methods of detecting pain from facial expressions are limited due to interpretability and severity quantification. To this end, we propose GraphAU-Pain, leveraging a graph-based framework to model facial Action Units (AUs) and their interrelationships for pain intensity estimation. AUs are represented as graph nodes, with co-occurrence relationships as edges, enabling a more expressive depiction of pain-related facial behaviors. By utilizing a relational graph neural network, our framework offers improved interpretability and significant performance gains. Experiments conducted on the publicly available UNBC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the GraphAU-Pain, achieving an F1-score of 66.21% and accuracy of 87.61% in pain intensity estimation.

- **Summary**: The design of convolutional neural architectures that are exactly equivariant to continuous translations is an active field of research. It promises to benefit scientific computing, notably by making existing imaging systems more physically accurate. Most efforts focus on the design of downsampling/pooling layers, upsampling layers and activation functions, but little attention is dedicated to normalization layers. In this work, we present a novel theoretical framework for understanding the equivariance of normalization layers to discrete shifts and continuous translations. We also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for normalization layers to be equivariant in terms of the dimensions they operate on. Using real feature maps from ResNet-18 and ImageNet, we test those theoretical results empirically and find that they are consistent with our predictions.

- **Summary**: Traditional approaches to adapting multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to new tasks have relied heavily on fine-tuning. This paper introduces Efficient Multi-Modal Long Context Learning (EMLoC), a novel training-free alternative that embeds demonstration examples directly into the model input. EMLoC offers a more efficient, flexible, and scalable solution for task adaptation. Because extremely lengthy inputs introduce prohibitive computational and memory overhead, EMLoC contributes a chunk-wise compression mechanism combined with layer-wise adaptive pruning. It condenses long-context multimodal inputs into compact, task-specific memory representations. By adaptively pruning tokens at each layer under a Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint, our method achieves a dramatic reduction in inference complexity without sacrificing performance. This approach is the first to seamlessly integrate compression and pruning techniques for multi-modal long-context learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for real-world applications. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that EMLoC achieves performance on par with or superior to naive long-context approaches. Our results highlight the potential of EMLoC as a groundbreaking framework for efficient and flexible adaptation of multi-modal models in resource-constrained environments. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/EMLoC.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have transformed novel view synthesis by modeling scene-specific volumetric representations directly from images. While generalizable NeRF models can generate novel views across unknown scenes by learning latent ray representations, their performance heavily depends on a large number of multi-view observations. However, with limited input views, these methods experience significant degradation in rendering quality. To address this limitation, we propose GoLF-NRT: a Global and Local feature Fusion-based Neural Rendering Transformer. GoLF-NRT enhances generalizable neural rendering from few input views by leveraging a 3D transformer with efficient sparse attention to capture global scene context. In parallel, it integrates local geometric features extracted along the epipolar line, enabling high-quality scene reconstruction from as few as 1 to 3 input views. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy based on attention weights and kernel regression, improving the accuracy of transformer-based neural rendering. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that GoLF-NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying numbers of input views, highlighting the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis and autonomous driving and has a problem with the high cost of annotating the labels required in training. To address this problem, semantic segmentation methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets: PASCAL and MS COCO.

- **Summary**: Evaluating the video understanding capabilities of Video-Language Models (VLMs) remains a significant challenge. We propose a long-context video understanding benchmark, Causal2Needles, that assesses two crucial abilities insufficiently evaluated by existing benchmarks: (1) the ability to extract information from two separate locations in a long video and understand them jointly, and (2) the ability to model the world in terms of cause and effect in human behaviors. Specifically, Causal2Needles introduces 2-needle questions, which require extracting information from both the cause and effect human-behavior events in a long video and the associated narration text. To prevent textual bias, these questions comprise two complementary formats: one asking to identify the video clip containing the answer, and one asking for the textual description of an unrelated visual detail from that video clip. Our experiments reveal that models excelling in pre-existing benchmarks struggle with 2-needle visual grounding, and the model performance is negatively correlated with the distance between the two needles. These findings highlight critical limitations in current VLMs.

- **Summary**: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has gained attention as a fast and effective method for novel view synthesis. It has also been applied to 3D reconstruction using multi-view images and can achieve fast and accurate 3D reconstruction. However, GS assumes that the input contains a large number of multi-view images, and therefore, the reconstruction accuracy significantly decreases when only a limited number of input images are available. One of the main reasons is the insufficient number of 3D points in the sparse point cloud obtained through Structure from Motion (SfM), which results in a poor initialization for optimizing the Gaussian primitives. We propose a new 3D reconstruction method, called Sparse2DGS, to enhance 2DGS in reconstructing objects using only three images. Sparse2DGS employs DUSt3R, a fundamental model for stereo images, along with COLMAP MVS to generate highly accurate and dense 3D point clouds, which are then used to initialize 2D Gaussians. Through experiments on the DTU dataset, we show that Sparse2DGS can accurately reconstruct the 3D shapes of objects using just three images.

- **Summary**: The real world is dynamic, yet most image fusion methods process static frames independently, ignoring temporal correlations in videos and leading to flickering and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we propose Unified Video Fusion (UniVF), a novel framework for temporally coherent video fusion that leverages multi-frame learning and optical flow-based feature warping for informative, temporally coherent video fusion. To support its development, we also introduce Video Fusion Benchmark (VF-Bench), the first comprehensive benchmark covering four video fusion tasks: multi-exposure, multi-focus, infrared-visible, and medical fusion. VF-Bench provides high-quality, well-aligned video pairs obtained through synthetic data generation and rigorous curation from existing datasets, with a unified evaluation protocol that jointly assesses the spatial quality and temporal consistency of video fusion. Extensive experiments show that UniVF achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks on VF-Bench. Project page: https://vfbench.github.io.

- **Summary**: We introduce FruitNeRF++, a novel fruit-counting approach that combines contrastive learning with neural radiance fields to count fruits from unstructured input photographs of orchards. Our work is based on FruitNeRF, which employs a neural semantic field combined with a fruit-specific clustering approach. The requirement for adaptation for each fruit type limits the applicability of the method, and makes it difficult to use in practice. To lift this limitation, we design a shape-agnostic multi-fruit counting framework, that complements the RGB and semantic data with instance masks predicted by a vision foundation model. The masks are used to encode the identity of each fruit as instance embeddings into a neural instance field. By volumetrically sampling the neural fields, we extract a point cloud embedded with the instance features, which can be clustered in a fruit-agnostic manner to obtain the fruit count. We evaluate our approach using a synthetic dataset containing apples, plums, lemons, pears, peaches, and mangoes, as well as a real-world benchmark apple dataset. Our results demonstrate that FruitNeRF++ is easier to control and compares favorably to other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recent studies show that simple training-free techniques can dramatically improve the quality of text-to-2D generation outputs, e.g. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) or FreeU. However, these training-free techniques have been underexplored in the lens of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which is a popular and effective technique to leverage the power of pretrained text-to-2D diffusion models for various tasks. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the effect such training-free techniques have on SDS, via a particular application of text-to-3D generation via 2D lifting. We present our findings, which show that varying the scales of CFG presents a trade-off between object size and surface smoothness, while varying the scales of FreeU presents a trade-off between texture details and geometric errors. Based on these findings, we provide insights into how we can effectively harness training-free techniques for SDS, via a strategic scaling of such techniques in a dynamic manner with respect to the timestep or optimization iteration step. We show that using our proposed scheme strikes a favorable balance between texture details and surface smoothness in text-to-3D generations, while preserving the size of the output and mitigating the occurrence of geometric defects.

- **Summary**: We introduce Deep Spectral Prior (DSP), a new formulation of Deep Image Prior (DIP) that redefines image reconstruction as a frequency-domain alignment problem. Unlike traditional DIP, which relies on pixel-wise loss and early stopping to mitigate overfitting, DSP directly matches Fourier coefficients between the network output and observed measurements. This shift introduces an explicit inductive bias towards spectral coherence, aligning with the known frequency structure of images and the spectral bias of convolutional neural networks. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating that DSP acts as an implicit spectral regulariser, suppressing high-frequency noise by design and eliminating the need for early stopping. Our analysis spans four core dimensions establishing smooth convergence dynamics, local stability, and favourable bias-variance tradeoffs. We further show that DSP naturally projects reconstructions onto a frequency-consistent manifold, enhancing interpretability and robustness. These theoretical guarantees are supported by empirical results across denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks, where DSP consistently outperforms classical DIP and other unsupervised baselines.

- **Summary**: In the current research landscape, multimodal autoregressive (AR) models have shown exceptional capabilities across various domains, including visual understanding and generation. However, complex tasks such as style-aligned text-to-image generation present significant challenges, particularly in data acquisition. In analogy to instruction-following tuning for image editing of AR models, style-aligned generation requires a reference style image and prompt, resulting in a text-image-to-image triplet where the output shares the style and semantics of the input. However, acquiring large volumes of such triplet data with specific styles is considerably more challenging than obtaining conventional text-to-image data used for training generative models. To address this issue, we propose StyleAR, an innovative approach that combines a specially designed data curation method with our proposed AR models to effectively utilize text-to-image binary data for style-aligned text-to-image generation. Our method synthesizes target stylized data using a reference style image and prompt, but only incorporates the target stylized image as the image modality to create high-quality binary data. To facilitate binary data training, we introduce a CLIP image encoder with a perceiver resampler that translates the image input into style tokens aligned with multimodal tokens in AR models and implement a style-enhanced token technique to prevent content leakage which is a common issue in previous work. Furthermore, we mix raw images drawn from large-scale text-image datasets with stylized images to enhance StyleAR's ability to extract richer stylistic features and ensure style consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our superior performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at https://github.com/wbfwonderful/Vad-R1.

- **Summary**: The use of multi-view images acquired by a 360-degree camera can reconstruct a 3D space with a wide area. There are 3D reconstruction methods from equirectangular images based on NeRF and 3DGS, as well as Novel View Synthesis (NVS) methods. On the other hand, it is necessary to overcome the large distortion caused by the projection model of a 360-degree camera when equirectangular images are used. In 3DGS-based methods, the large distortion of the 360-degree camera model generates extremely large 3D Gaussians, resulting in poor rendering accuracy. We propose ErpGS, which is Omnidirectional GS based on 3DGS to realize NVS addressing the problems. ErpGS introduce some rendering accuracy improvement techniques: geometric regularization, scale regularization, and distortion-aware weights and a mask to suppress the effects of obstacles in equirectangular images. Through experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that ErpGS can render novel view images more accurately than conventional methods.

- **Summary**: Current video-based fall detection research mostly relies on small, staged datasets with significant domain biases concerning background, lighting, and camera setup resulting in unknown real-world performance. We introduce OmniFall, unifying eight public fall detection datasets (roughly 14 h of recordings, roughly 42 h of multiview data, 101 subjects, 29 camera views) under a consistent ten-class taxonomy with standardized evaluation protocols. Our benchmark provides complete video segmentation labels and enables fair cross-dataset comparison previously impossible with incompatible annotation schemes. For real-world evaluation we curate OOPS-Fall from genuine accident videos and establish a staged-to-wild protocol measuring generalization from controlled to uncontrolled environments. Experiments with frozen pre-trained backbones such as I3D or VideoMAE reveal significant performance gaps between in-distribution and in-the-wild scenarios, highlighting critical challenges in developing robust fall detection systems.

- **Summary**: Underwater images are often affected by complex degradations such as light absorption, scattering, color casts, and artifacts, making enhancement critical for effective object detection, recognition, and scene understanding in aquatic environments. Existing methods, especially diffusion-based approaches, typically rely on synthetic paired datasets due to the scarcity of real underwater references, introducing bias and limiting generalization. Furthermore, fine-tuning these models can degrade learned priors, resulting in unrealistic enhancements due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we propose UDAN-CLIP, an image-to-image diffusion framework pre-trained on synthetic underwater datasets and enhanced with a customized classifier based on vision-language model, a spatial attention module, and a novel CLIP-Diffusion loss. The classifier preserves natural in-air priors and semantically guides the diffusion process, while the spatial attention module focuses on correcting localized degradations such as haze and low contrast. The proposed CLIP-Diffusion loss further strengthens visual-textual alignment and helps maintain semantic consistency during enhancement. The proposed contributions empower our UDAN-CLIP model to perform more effective underwater image enhancement, producing results that are not only visually compelling but also more realistic and detail-preserving. These improvements are consistently validated through both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual comparisons, demonstrating the model's ability to correct distortions and restore natural appearance in challenging underwater conditions.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their impact beyond Natural Language Processing, substantially fostering the development of interdisciplinary research. Recently, various LLM-based agents have been developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and (ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15% overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in image-to-video (I2V) generation have shown promising performance in conventional scenarios. However, these methods still encounter significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range, controllability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in comparison to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in understanding complex real-world scenarios and supporting data-driven decision-making processes. However, VLMs exhibit significant vulnerability against adversarial examples, either text or image, which can lead to various adversarial outcomes, e.g., jailbreaking, hijacking, and hallucination, etc. In this work, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate that VLMs are particularly susceptible to image-based adversarial examples, where imperceptible perturbations can precisely manipulate each output token. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Vision-language model Manipulation Attack (VMA), which integrates first-order and second-order momentum optimization techniques with a differentiable transformation mechanism to effectively optimize the adversarial perturbation. Notably, VMA can be a double-edged sword: it can be leveraged to implement various attacks, such as jailbreaking, hijacking, privacy breaches, Denial-of-Service, and the generation of sponge examples, etc, while simultaneously enabling the injection of watermarks for copyright protection. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy and generalizability of VMA across diverse scenarios and datasets.

- **Summary**: For tasks such as urban digital twins, VR/AR/game scene design, or creating synthetic films, the traditional industrial approach often involves manually modeling scenes and using various rendering engines to complete the rendering process. This approach typically requires high labor costs and hardware demands, and can result in poor quality when replicating complex real-world scenes. A more efficient approach is to use data from captured real-world scenes, then apply reconstruction and rendering algorithms to quickly recreate the authentic scene. However, current algorithms are unable to effectively reconstruct and render real-world weather effects. To address this, we propose a framework based on gaussian splatting, that can reconstruct real scenes and render them under synthesized 4D weather effects. Our work can simulate various common weather effects by applying Gaussians modeling and rendering techniques. It supports continuous dynamic weather changes and can easily control the details of the effects. Additionally, our work has low hardware requirements and achieves real-time rendering performance.

- **Summary**: Traditional face recognition systems rely on extracting fixed face representations, known as templates, to store and verify identities. These representations are typically generated by neural networks that often lack explainability and raise concerns regarding fairness and privacy. In this work, we propose a novel model-template (MOTE) approach that replaces vector-based face templates with small personalized neural networks. This design enables more responsible face recognition for small and medium-scale systems. During enrollment, MOTE creates a dedicated binary classifier for each identity, trained to determine whether an input face matches the enrolled identity. Each classifier is trained using only a single reference sample, along with synthetically balanced samples to allow adjusting fairness at the level of a single individual during enrollment. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and recognition systems demonstrate substantial improvements in fairness and particularly in privacy. Although the method increases inference time and storage requirements, it presents a strong solution for small- and mid-scale applications where fairness and privacy are critical.

- **Summary**: Audio-visual zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been extensively researched for its capability to classify video data from unseen classes during training. Nevertheless, current methodologies often struggle with background scene biases and inadequate motion detail. This paper proposes a novel dual-stream Multi-Timescale Motion-Decoupled Spiking Transformer (MDST++), which decouples contextual semantic information and sparse dynamic motion information. The recurrent joint learning unit is proposed to extract contextual semantic information and capture joint knowledge across various modalities to understand the environment of actions. By converting RGB images to events, our method captures motion information more accurately and mitigates background scene biases. Moreover, we introduce a discrepancy analysis block to model audio motion information. To enhance the robustness of SNNs in extracting temporal and motion cues, we dynamically adjust the threshold of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons based on global motion and contextual semantic information. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of MDST++, demonstrating their consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods on mainstream benchmarks. Additionally, incorporating motion and multi-timescale information significantly improves HM and ZSL accuracy by 26.2\% and 39.9\%.

- **Summary**: The diagram is a visual representation of a relationship illustrated with edges (lines or arrows), which is widely used in industrial and scientific communication. Although recognizing diagrams is essential for vision language models (VLMs) to comprehend domain-specific knowledge, recent studies reveal that many VLMs fail to identify edges in images. We hypothesize that these failures stem from an over-reliance on textual and positional biases, preventing VLMs from learning explicit edge features. Based on this idea, we empirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge representation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased neither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct contrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to train an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three tasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning. Our results show that the finetuned model outperforms pretrained CLIP in all tasks and surpasses zero-shot GPT-4o and LLaVA-Mistral in the captioning task. These findings confirm that eliminating textual and positional biases fosters accurate edge recognition in VLMs, offering a promising path for advancing diagram understanding.

- **Summary**: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful technique for imaging macromolecular complexes in their near-native states. However, the localization of 3D particles in cellular environments still presents a significant challenge due to low signal-to-noise ratios and missing wedge artifacts. Deep learning approaches have shown great potential, but they need huge amounts of data, which can be a challenge in cryo-ET scenarios where labeled data is often scarce. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-augmented and Self-interpreted (SaSi) deep learning approach towards few-shot particle detection in 3D cryo-ET images. Our method builds upon self-augmentation techniques to further boost data utilization and introduces a self-interpreted segmentation strategy for alleviating dependency on labeled data, hence improving generalization and robustness. As demonstrated by experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world cryo-ET datasets, the SaSi approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for particle localization. This research increases understanding of how to detect particles with very few labels in cryo-ET and thus sets a new benchmark for few-shot learning in structural biology.

- **Summary**: Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images given a compositional query, consisting of a reference image and a modifying text-without relying on annotated training data. Existing approaches often generate a synthetic target text using large language models (LLMs) to serve as an intermediate anchor between the compositional query and the target image. Models are then trained to align the compositional query with the generated text, and separately align images with their corresponding texts using contrastive learning. However, this reliance on intermediate text introduces error propagation, as inaccuracies in query-to-text and text-to-image mappings accumulate, ultimately degrading retrieval performance. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework by employing a Multimodal Reasoning Agent (MRA) for ZS-CIR. MRA eliminates the dependence on textual intermediaries by directly constructing triplets, <reference image, modification text, target image>, using only unlabeled image data. By training on these synthetic triplets, our model learns to capture the relationships between compositional queries and candidate images directly. Extensive experiments on three standard CIR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the FashionIQ dataset, our method improves Average R@10 by at least 7.5\% over existing baselines; on CIRR, it boosts R@1 by 9.6\%; and on CIRCO, it increases mAP@5 by 9.5\%.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have shown great potential in generating realistic image detail. However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling. In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables ultra-realistic and temporal-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware Restoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the low-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a single-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos. This design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds up inference. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight yet effective Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, composed of an RTS-convolution unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along the temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective feature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without relying on explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporal coherence while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a single sampling step.

- **Summary**: Long-term Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate the quantitative performance of actions in long videos. However, existing methods face challenges due to domain shifts between the pre-trained large-scale action recognition backbones and the specific AQA task, thereby hindering their performance. This arises since fine-tuning resource-intensive backbones on small AQA datasets is impractical. We address this by identifying two levels of domain shift: task-level, regarding differences in task objectives, and feature-level, regarding differences in important features. For feature-level shifts, which are more detrimental, we propose Progressive Hierarchical Instruction (PHI) with two strategies. First, Gap Minimization Flow (GMF) leverages flow matching to progressively learn a fast flow path that reduces the domain gap between initial and desired features across shallow to deep layers. Additionally, a temporally-enhanced attention module captures long-range dependencies essential for AQA. Second, List-wise Contrastive Regularization (LCR) facilitates coarse-to-fine alignment by comprehensively comparing batch pairs to learn fine-grained cues while mitigating domain shift. Integrating these modules, PHI offers an effective solution. Experiments demonstrate that PHI achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative long-term AQA datasets, proving its superiority in addressing the domain shift for long-term AQA.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved significant success in wireless communications systems due to their denoising capabilities. The broadcast nature of wireless signals makes them susceptible not only to Gaussian noise, but also to unaware interference. This raises the question of whether DMs can effectively mitigate interference in wireless semantic communication systems. In this paper, we model the interference cancellation problem as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem over the joint posterior probability of the signal and interference, and theoretically prove that the solution provides excellent estimates for the signal and interference. To solve this problem, we develop an interference cancellation diffusion model (ICDM), which decomposes the joint posterior into independent prior probabilities of the signal and interference, along with the channel transition probablity. The log-gradients of these distributions at each time step are learned separately by DMs and accurately estimated through deriving. ICDM further integrates these gradients with advanced numerical iteration method, achieving accurate and rapid interference cancellation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICDM significantly reduces the mean square error (MSE) and enhances perceptual quality compared to schemes without ICDM. For example, on the CelebA dataset under the Rayleigh fading channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $20$ dB and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of 0 dB, ICDM reduces the MSE by 4.54 dB and improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) by 2.47 dB.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) inherently encode strong inductive biases, enabling effective generalization on small-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose integrating this inductive bias into ViTs, not through an architectural intervention but solely through initialization. The motivation here is to have a ViT that can enjoy strong CNN-like performance when data assets are small, but can still scale to ViT-like performance as the data expands. Our approach is motivated by our empirical results that random impulse filters can achieve commensurate performance to learned filters within a CNN. We improve upon current ViT initialization strategies, which typically rely on empirical heuristics such as using attention weights from pretrained models or focusing on the distribution of attention weights without enforcing structures. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms standard ViT initialization across numerous small and medium-scale benchmarks, including Food-101, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Flowers, and Pets, while maintaining comparative performance on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet-1K. Moreover, our initialization strategy can be easily integrated into various transformer-based architectures such as Swin Transformer and MLP-Mixer with consistent improvements in performance.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a progressive scaling training strategy for visual object tracking, systematically analyzing the influence of training data volume, model size, and input resolution on tracking performance. Our empirical study reveals that while scaling each factor leads to significant improvements in tracking accuracy, naive training suffers from suboptimal optimization and limited iterative refinement. To address this issue, we introduce DT-Training, a progressive scaling framework that integrates small teacher transfer and dual-branch alignment to maximize model potential. The resulting scaled tracker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and transferability of the proposed method. Furthermore, we validate the broader applicability of our approach to additional tasks, underscoring its versatility beyond tracking.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence and machine learning models deployed on edge devices, e.g., for quality control in Additive Manufacturing (AM), are frequently small in size. Such models usually have to deliver highly accurate results within a short time frame. Methods that are commonly employed in literature start out with larger trained models and try to reduce their memory and latency footprint by structural pruning, knowledge distillation, or quantization. It is, however, also possible to leverage hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS), an approach that seeks to systematically explore the architecture space to find optimized configurations. In this study, a hardware-aware NAS workflow is introduced that couples an edge device located in Belgium with a powerful High-Performance Computing system in Germany, to train possible architecture candidates as fast as possible while performing real-time latency measurements on the target hardware. The approach is verified on a use case in the AM domain, based on the open RAISE-LPBF dataset, achieving ~8.8 times faster inference speed while simultaneously enhancing model quality by a factor of ~1.35, compared to a human-designed baseline.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal object re-identification (ReID) aims to extract identity features across heterogeneous spectral modalities to enable accurate recognition and retrieval in complex real-world scenarios. However, most existing methods rely on implicit feature fusion structures, making it difficult to model fine-grained recognition strategies under varying challenging conditions. Benefiting from the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the visual appearance of an object can be effectively translated into descriptive text. In this paper, we propose a reliable multi-modal caption generation method based on attribute confidence, which significantly reduces the unknown recognition rate of MLLMs in multi-modal semantic generation and improves the quality of generated text. Additionally, we propose a novel ReID framework NEXT, the Multi-grained Mixture of Experts via Text-Modulation for Multi-modal Object Re-Identification. Specifically, we decouple the recognition problem into semantic and structural expert branches to separately capture modality-specific appearance and intrinsic structure. For semantic recognition, we propose the Text-Modulated Semantic-sampling Experts (TMSE), which leverages randomly sampled high-quality semantic texts to modulate expert-specific sampling of multi-modal features and mining intra-modality fine-grained semantic cues. Then, to recognize coarse-grained structure features, we propose the Context-Shared Structure-aware Experts (CSSE) that focuses on capturing the holistic object structure across modalities and maintains inter-modality structural consistency through a soft routing mechanism. Finally, we propose the Multi-Modal Feature Aggregation (MMFA), which adopts a unified feature fusion strategy to simply and effectively integrate semantic and structural expert outputs into the final identity representations.

- **Summary**: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal comprehension and reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with trivially simple visual tasks. In this work, we focus on the domain of basic 2D Euclidean geometry and systematically categorize the fundamental, indivisible visual perception skills, which we refer to as atomic visual skills. We then introduce the Atomic Visual Skills Dataset (AVSD) for evaluating VLMs on the atomic visual skills. Using AVSD, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs and find that they struggle with these tasks, despite being trivial for adult humans. Our findings highlight the need for purpose-built datasets to train and evaluate VLMs on atomic, rather than composite, visual perception tasks.

- **Summary**: Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset, namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of 19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore, ReasonPlan demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark, highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases. Code and dataset will be found in https://github.com/Liuxueyi/ReasonPlan.

- **Summary**: Tactile sensing provides local essential information that is complementary to visual perception, such as texture, compliance, and force. Despite recent advances in visuotactile representation learning, challenges remain in fusing these modalities and generalizing across tasks and environments without heavy reliance on pre-trained vision-language models. Moreover, existing methods do not study positional encodings, thereby overlooking the multi-scale spatial reasoning needed to capture fine-grained visuotactile correlations. We introduce ViTaPEs, a transformer-based framework that robustly integrates visual and tactile input data to learn task-agnostic representations for visuotactile perception. Our approach exploits a novel multi-scale positional encoding scheme to capture intra-modal structures, while simultaneously modeling cross-modal cues. Unlike prior work, we provide provable guarantees in visuotactile fusion, showing that our encodings are injective, rigid-motion-equivariant, and information-preserving, validating these properties empirically. Experiments on multiple large-scale real-world datasets show that ViTaPEs not only surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across various recognition tasks but also demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen, out-of-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the transfer-learning strength of ViTaPEs in a robotic grasping task, where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predicting grasp success.

- **Summary**: Effective human-AI interaction relies on AI's ability to accurately perceive and interpret human emotions. Current benchmarks for vision and vision-language models are severely limited, offering a narrow emotional spectrum that overlooks nuanced states (e.g., bitterness, intoxication) and fails to distinguish subtle differences between related feelings (e.g., shame vs. embarrassment). Existing datasets also often use uncontrolled imagery with occluded faces and lack demographic diversity, risking significant bias. To address these critical gaps, we introduce EmoNet Face, a comprehensive benchmark suite. EmoNet Face features: (1) A novel 40-category emotion taxonomy, meticulously derived from foundational research to capture finer details of human emotional experiences. (2) Three large-scale, AI-generated datasets (EmoNet HQ, Binary, and Big) with explicit, full-face expressions and controlled demographic balance across ethnicity, age, and gender. (3) Rigorous, multi-expert annotations for training and high-fidelity evaluation. (4) We build Empathic Insight Face, a model achieving human-expert-level performance on our benchmark. The publicly released EmoNet Face suite - taxonomy, datasets, and model - provides a robust foundation for developing and evaluating AI systems with a deeper understanding of human emotions.

- **Summary**: Generating high-quality piano audio from video requires precise synchronization between visual cues and musical output, ensuring accurate semantic and temporal alignment.However, existing evaluation datasets do not fully capture the intricate synchronization required for piano music generation. A comprehensive benchmark is essential for two primary reasons: (1) existing metrics fail to reflect the complexity of video-to-piano music interactions, and (2) a dedicated benchmark dataset can provide valuable insights to accelerate progress in high-quality piano music generation. To address these challenges, we introduce the CoP Benchmark Dataset-a fully open-sourced, multimodal benchmark designed specifically for video-guided piano music generation. The proposed Chain-of-Perform (CoP) benchmark offers several compelling features: (1) detailed multimodal annotations, enabling precise semantic and temporal alignment between video content and piano audio via step-by-step Chain-of-Perform guidance; (2) a versatile evaluation framework for rigorous assessment of both general-purpose and specialized video-to-piano generation tasks; and (3) full open-sourcing of the dataset, annotations, and evaluation protocols. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/acappemin/Video-to-Audio-and-Piano, with a continuously updated leaderboard to promote ongoing research in this domain.

- **Summary**: RGB-D scene parsing methods effectively capture both semantic and geometric features of the environment, demonstrating great potential under challenging conditions such as extreme weather and low lighting. However, existing RGB-D scene parsing methods predominantly rely on supervised training strategies, which require a large amount of manually annotated pixel-level labels that are both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DepthMatch, a semi-supervised learning framework that is specifically designed for RGB-D scene parsing. To make full use of unlabeled data, we propose complementary patch mix-up augmentation to explore the latent relationships between texture and spatial features in RGB-D image pairs. We also design a lightweight spatial prior injector to replace traditional complex fusion modules, improving the efficiency of heterogeneous feature fusion. Furthermore, we introduce depth-guided boundary loss to enhance the model's boundary prediction capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DepthMatch exhibits high applicability in both indoor and outdoor scenes, achieving state-of-the-art results on the NYUv2 dataset and ranking first on the KITTI Semantics benchmark.



### Data-Free Class-Incremental Gesture Recognition with Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay

- **Summary**: Gesture recognition is an important research area in the field of computer vision. Most gesture recognition efforts focus on close-set scenarios, thereby limiting the capacity to effectively handle unseen or novel gestures. We aim to address class-incremental gesture recognition, which entails the ability to accommodate new and previously unseen gestures over time. Specifically, we introduce a Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay (PGPFR) framework for data-free class-incremental gesture recognition. This framework comprises four components: Pseudo Feature Generation with Batch Prototypes (PFGBP), Variational Prototype Replay (VPR) for old classes, Truncated Cross-Entropy (TCE) for new classes, and Continual Classifier Re-Training (CCRT). To tackle the issue of catastrophic forgetting, the PFGBP dynamically generates a diversity of pseudo features in an online manner, leveraging class prototypes of old classes along with batch class prototypes of new classes. Furthermore, the VPR enforces consistency between the classifier's weights and the prototypes of old classes, leveraging class prototypes and covariance matrices to enhance robustness and generalization capabilities. The TCE mitigates the impact of domain differences of the classifier caused by pseudo features. Finally, the CCRT training strategy is designed to prevent overfitting to new classes and ensure the stability of features extracted from old classes. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used gesture recognition datasets, namely SHREC 2017 3D and EgoGesture 3D, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 11.8\% and 12.8\% in terms of mean global accuracy, respectively.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt controllability. However, current inference pipelines generally lack interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.

- **Summary**: Computational dance generation is crucial in many areas, such as art, human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and digital entertainment, particularly for generating coherent and expressive long dance sequences. Diffusion-based music-to-dance generation has made significant progress, yet existing methods still struggle to produce physically plausible motions. To address this, we propose Plausibility-Aware Motion Diffusion (PAMD), a framework for generating dances that are both musically aligned and physically realistic. The core of PAMD lies in the Plausible Motion Constraint (PMC), which leverages Neural Distance Fields (NDFs) to model the actual pose manifold and guide generated motions toward a physically valid pose manifold. To provide more effective guidance during generation, we incorporate Prior Motion Guidance (PMG), which uses standing poses as auxiliary conditions alongside music features. To further enhance realism for complex movements, we introduce the Motion Refinement with Foot-ground Contact (MRFC) module, which addresses foot-skating artifacts by bridging the gap between the optimization objective in linear joint position space and the data representation in nonlinear rotation space. Extensive experiments show that PAMD significantly improves musical alignment and enhances the physical plausibility of generated motions.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D hand mesh recovery is challenging due to high degrees of freedom of hands, 2D-to-3D ambiguity and self-occlusion. Most existing methods are either inefficient or less straightforward for predicting the position of 3D mesh vertices. Thus, we propose a new pipeline called Monocular 3D Hand Mesh Recovery (M3DHMR) to directly estimate the positions of hand mesh vertices. M3DHMR provides 2D cues for 3D tasks from a single image and uses a new spiral decoder consist of several Dynamic Spiral Convolution (DSC) Layers and a Region of Interest (ROI) Layer. On the one hand, DSC Layers adaptively adjust the weights based on the vertex positions and extract the vertex features in both spatial and channel dimensions. On the other hand, ROI Layer utilizes the physical information and refines mesh vertices in each predefined hand region separately. Extensive experiments on popular dataset FreiHAND demonstrate that M3DHMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art real-time methods.

- **Summary**: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in video understanding tasks. However, they often suffer from heavy computational overhead due to the large number of visual tokens generated from multiple video frames. Existing visual token compression methods often rely on attention scores from language models as guidance. However, these scores exhibit inherent biases: global bias reflects a tendency to focus on the two ends of the visual token sequence, while local bias leads to an over-concentration on the same spatial positions across different frames. To address the issue of attention bias, we propose $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{D}$ebi$\textbf{a}$sed $\textbf{T}$oken $\textbf{P}$runing for Video Large Language Models ($\textbf{AdaTP}$), a novel token pruning pipeline for Video LLMs. AdaTP integrates two dedicated debiasing modules into the pipeline, targeting global attention bias and local attention bias, respectively. Without the need for additional training, our method significantly reduces the computational overhead of Video LLMs while retaining the performance of vanilla models. Extensive evaluation shows that AdaTP achieves state-of-the-art performance in various commonly used video understanding benchmarks. In particular, on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, AdaTP maintains performance without degradation while using only up to $27.3\%$ FLOPs compared to the vanilla model. Our code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: We present OvSGTR, a novel transformer-based framework for fully open-vocabulary scene graph generation that overcomes the limitations of traditional closed-set models. Conventional methods restrict both object and relationship recognition to a fixed vocabulary, hindering their applicability to real-world scenarios where novel concepts frequently emerge. In contrast, our approach jointly predicts objects (nodes) and their inter-relationships (edges) beyond predefined categories. OvSGTR leverages a DETR-like architecture featuring a frozen image backbone and text encoder to extract high-quality visual and semantic features, which are then fused via a transformer decoder for end-to-end scene graph prediction. To enrich the model's understanding of complex visual relations, we propose a relation-aware pre-training strategy that synthesizes scene graph annotations in a weakly supervised manner. Specifically, we investigate three pipelines--scene parser-based, LLM-based, and multimodal LLM-based--to generate transferable supervision signals with minimal manual annotation. Furthermore, we address the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in open-vocabulary settings by incorporating a visual-concept retention mechanism coupled with a knowledge distillation strategy, ensuring that the model retains rich semantic cues during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on the VG150 benchmark demonstrate that OvSGTR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings, including closed-set, open-vocabulary object detection-based, relation-based, and fully open-vocabulary scenarios. Our results highlight the promise of large-scale relation-aware pre-training and transformer architectures for advancing scene graph generation towards more generalized and reliable visual understanding.

- **Summary**: Text-to-multiview (T2MV) generation, which produces coherent multiview images from a single text prompt, remains computationally intensive, while accelerated T2MV methods using few-step diffusion models often sacrifice image fidelity and view consistency. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to jointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we first reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov decision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a joint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV sampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both viewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the cost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base sampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that uses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning signals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward objective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view metrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view fidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more efficient and balanced policy updates. By integrating this constrained optimization paradigm with MV-ZigAL, we establish our complete RL finetuning framework, referred to as MVC-ZigAL, which effectively refines the few-step T2MV diffusion baseline in both fidelity and consistency while preserving its few-step efficiency.

To facilitate controlled experimentation, we also present a flexible and scalable data generation pipeline that supports the construction of diverse annotated scenes.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, capable of producing high-quality samples that generalize beyond the training data. However, evaluating this generalization remains challenging: theoretical metrics are often impractical for high-dimensional data, while no practical metrics rigorously measure generalization. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing probability flow distance ($\texttt{PFD}$), a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient metric to measure distributional generalization. Specifically, $\texttt{PFD}$ quantifies the distance between distributions by comparing their noise-to-data mappings induced by the probability flow ODE. Moreover, by using $\texttt{PFD}$ under a teacher-student evaluation protocol, we empirically uncover several key generalization behaviors in diffusion models, including: (1) scaling behavior from memorization to generalization, (2) early learning and double descent training dynamics, and (3) bias-variance decomposition. Beyond these insights, our work lays a foundation for future empirical and theoretical studies on generalization in diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Videos are unique in their integration of temporal elements, including camera, scene, action, and attribute, along with their dynamic relationships over time. However, existing benchmarks for video understanding often treat these properties separately or narrowly focus on specific aspects, overlooking the holistic nature of video content. To address this, we introduce TUNA, a temporal-oriented benchmark for fine-grained understanding on dense dynamic videos, with two complementary tasks: captioning and QA. Our TUNA features diverse video scenarios and dynamics, assisted by interpretable and robust evaluation criteria. We evaluate several leading models on our benchmark, providing fine-grained performance assessments across various dimensions. This evaluation reveals key challenges in video temporal understanding, such as limited action description, inadequate multi-subject understanding, and insensitivity to camera motion, offering valuable insights for improving video understanding models. The data and code are available at https://friedrichor.github.io/projects/TUNA.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in radiance field rendering, exemplified by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have significantly progressed 3D modeling and reconstruction. The use of multiple 360-degree omnidirectional images for these tasks is increasingly favored due to advantages in data acquisition and comprehensive scene capture. However, the inherent geometric distortions in common omnidirectional representations, such as equirectangular projection (particularly severe in polar regions and varying with latitude), pose substantial challenges to achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Current datasets, while valuable, often lack the specific focus, scene composition, and ground truth granularity required to systematically benchmark and drive progress in overcoming these omnidirectional-specific challenges. To address this critical gap, we introduce Omnidirectional Blender 3D (OB3D), a new synthetic dataset curated for advancing 3D reconstruction from multiple omnidirectional images. OB3D features diverse and complex 3D scenes generated from Blender 3D projects, with a deliberate emphasis on challenging scenarios. The dataset provides comprehensive ground truth, including omnidirectional RGB images, precise omnidirectional camera parameters, and pixel-aligned equirectangular maps for depth and normals, alongside evaluation metrics. By offering a controlled yet challenging environment, OB3Daims to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of existing methods and prompt the development of new techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of 3D reconstruction from omnidirectional images.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

- **Summary**: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual understanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement through reinforcement learning.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on using few-shot learning to improve the accuracy of classifying OCT diagnosis images with major and rare classes. We used the GAN-based augmentation strategy as a baseline and introduced several novel methods to further enhance our model. The proposed strategy contains U-GAT-IT for improving the generative part and uses the data balance technique to narrow down the skew of accuracy between all categories. The best model obtained was built with CBAM attention mechanism and fine-tuned InceptionV3, and achieved an overall accuracy of 97.85%, representing a significant improvement over the original baseline.

- **Summary**: Benefiting from contrastively trained visual encoders on large-scale natural scene images, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various visual perception tasks. However, the inherent limitations of contrastive learning upon summarized descriptions fundamentally restrict the capabilities of models in meticulous reasoning, particularly in crucial scenarios of geometric problem-solving. To enhance geometric understanding, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code, and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on caption similarity. We train CLIP using our strong negative learning method, namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM, significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models like GPT-4o. We further study the impact of different negative sample construction methods and the number of negative samples on the geometric reasoning performance of LMM, yielding fruitful conclusions. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/MMGeoLM.
