- **Summary**: Current sampling mechanisms for conditional diffusion models rely mainly on Classifier Free Guidance (CFG) to generate high-quality images. However, CFG requires several denoising passes in each time step, e.g., up to three passes in image editing tasks, resulting in excessive computational costs. This paper introduces a novel conditioning technique to ease the computational burden of the well-established guidance techniques, thereby significantly improving the inference time of diffusion models. We present Explicit Conditioning (EC) of the noise distribution on the input modalities to achieve this. Intuitively, we model the noise to guide the conditional diffusion model during the diffusion process. We present evaluations on image editing tasks and demonstrate that EC outperforms CFG in generating diverse high-quality images with significantly reduced computations.

- **Summary**: Well-being is a dynamic construct that evolves over time and fluctuates within individuals, presenting challenges for accurate quantification. Reduced well-being is often linked to depression or anxiety disorders, which are characterised by biases in visual attention towards specific stimuli, such as human faces. This paper introduces a novel approach to AI-assisted screening of affective disorders by analysing visual attention scan paths using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Data were collected from two studies examining (1) attentional tendencies in individuals diagnosed with major depression and (2) social anxiety. These data were processed using residual CNNs through images generated from eye-gaze patterns. Experimental results, obtained with ResNet architectures, demonstrated an average accuracy of 48% for a three-class system and 62% for a two-class system. Based on these exploratory findings, we propose that this method could be employed in rapid, ecological, and effective mental health screening systems to assess well-being through eye-tracking.

- **Summary**: Martian terrain recognition is pivotal for advancing our understanding of topography, geomorphology, paleoclimate, and habitability. While deep clustering methods have shown promise in learning semantically homogeneous feature embeddings from Martian rover imagery, the natural variations in intensity, scale, and rotation pose significant challenges for accurate terrain classification. To address these limitations, we propose Deep Constrained Clustering with Metric Learning (DCCML), a novel algorithm that leverages multiple constraint types to guide the clustering process. DCCML incorporates soft must-link constraints derived from spatial and depth similarities between neighboring patches, alongside hard constraints from stereo camera pairs and temporally adjacent images. Experimental evaluation on the Curiosity rover dataset (with 150 clusters) demonstrates that DCCML increases homogeneous clusters by 16.7 percent while reducing the Davies-Bouldin Index from 3.86 to 1.82 and boosting retrieval accuracy from 86.71 percent to 89.86 percent. This improvement enables more precise classification of Martian geological features, advancing our capacity to analyze and understand the planet's landscape.

- **Summary**: Video editing according to instructions is a highly challenging task due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale, high-quality edited video pair data. This scarcity not only limits the availability of training data but also hinders the systematic exploration of model architectures and training strategies. While prior work has improved specific aspects of video editing (e.g., synthesizing a video dataset using image editing techniques or decomposed video editing training), a holistic framework addressing the above challenges remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce InstructVEdit, a full-cycle instructional video editing approach that: (1) establishes a reliable dataset curation workflow to initialize training, (2) incorporates two model architectural improvements to enhance edit quality while preserving temporal consistency, and (3) proposes an iterative refinement strategy leveraging real-world data to enhance generalization and minimize train-test discrepancies. Extensive experiments show that InstructVEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction-based video editing, demonstrating robust adaptability to diverse real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Crowd monitoring in sports stadiums is important to enhance public safety and improve the audience experience. Existing approaches mainly rely on cameras and microphones, which can cause significant disturbances and often raise privacy concerns. In this paper, we sense floor vibration, which provides a less disruptive and more non-intrusive way of crowd sensing, to predict crowd behavior. However, since the vibration-based crowd monitoring approach is newly developed, one main challenge is the lack of training data due to sports stadiums being large public spaces with complex physical activities.   In this paper, we present ViLA (Vibration Leverage Audio), a vibration-based method that reduces the dependency on labeled data by pre-training with unlabeled cross-modality data. ViLA is first pre-trained on audio data in an unsupervised manner and then fine-tuned with a minimal amount of in-domain vibration data. By leveraging publicly available audio datasets, ViLA learns the wave behaviors from audio and then adapts the representation to vibration, reducing the reliance on domain-specific vibration data. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that pre-training the vibration model using publicly available audio data (YouTube8M) achieved up to a 5.8x error reduction compared to the model without audio pre-training.

- **Summary**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for adapting large vision transformers to downstream tasks without the prohibitive computational costs of full fine-tuning. While existing visual prompt tuning (VPT) methods have made significant strides, they predominantly rely on static, domain-specific prompts that fail to capture the rich visual diversity within individual instances. This paper introduces V$^2$APT (Visual Variational Autoencoder Prompt Tuning), a novel framework that generates dynamic, input-dependent prompts using a variational autoencoder architecture. By learning a latent representation of image-specific features and decoding them into customized prompts, V$^2$APT adapts to the unique visual characteristics of each input. Extensive experiments on FGVC, HTA, and VTAB-1k benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Notably, V$^2$APT achieves +3.2\% improvement over VPT-Deep on HTA, with an average performance gain of +2.0\% across all three datasets.

- **Summary**: Natural language video localization (NLVL) is a crucial task in video understanding that aims to localize the target moment in videos specified by a given language description. Recently, a point-supervised paradigm has been presented to address this task, requiring only a single annotated frame within the target moment rather than complete temporal boundaries. Compared with the fully-supervised paradigm, it offers a balance between localization accuracy and annotation cost. However, due to the absence of complete annotation, it is challenging to align the video content with language descriptions, consequently hindering accurate moment prediction. To address this problem, we propose a new COllaborative Temporal consistEncy Learning (COTEL) framework that leverages the synergy between saliency detection and moment localization to strengthen the video-language alignment. Specifically, we first design a frame- and a segment-level Temporal Consistency Learning (TCL) module that models semantic alignment across frame saliencies and sentence-moment pairs. Then, we design a cross-consistency guidance scheme, including a Frame-level Consistency Guidance (FCG) and a Segment-level Consistency Guidance (SCG), that enables the two temporal consistency learning paths to reinforce each other mutually. Further, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Alignment Loss (HCAL) to comprehensively align the video and text query. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that our method performs favorably against SoTA approaches. We will release all the source codes.

- **Summary**: Diffusion denoising models have become a popular approach for image generation, but they often suffer from slow convergence during training. In this paper, we identify that this slow convergence is partly due to the complexity of the Brownian motion driving the forward-time process. To address this, we represent the Brownian motion using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, truncating it to a limited number of eigenfunctions. We propose a novel ordinary differential equation with augmented random initials, termed KL diffusion, as a new forward-time process for training and sampling. By developing an appropriate denoising loss function, we facilitate the integration of our KL-diffusion into existing denoising-based models. Using the widely adopted DDIM framework as our baseline ensures a fair comparison, as our modifications focus solely on the forward process and loss function, leaving the network architecture and sampling methods unchanged. Our method significantly outperforms baseline diffusion models, achieving convergence speeds that are twice faster to reach the best FID score of the baseline and ultimately yielding much lower FID scores. Notably, our approach allows for highly parallelized computation, requires no additional learnable parameters, and can be flexibly integrated into existing diffusion methods. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Generative AI has significantly advanced text-driven image generation, but it still faces challenges in producing outputs that consistently align with evolving user preferences and intents, particularly in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.

- **Summary**: Creating accurate and efficient 3D models poses significant challenges, particularly in addressing large viewpoint variations, computational complexity, and alignment discrepancies. Efficient camera path generation can help resolve these issues. In this context, a modified version of the Affine Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (ASIFT) is proposed to extract more matching points with reduced computational overhead, ensuring an adequate number of inliers for precise camera rotation angle estimation. Additionally, a novel two-camera-based rotation correction model is introduced to mitigate small rotational errors, further enhancing accuracy. Furthermore, a stereo camera-based translation estimation and correction model is implemented to determine camera movement in 3D space by altering the Structure From Motion (SFM) model. Finally, the novel combination of ASIFT and two camera-based SFM models provides an accurate camera movement trajectory in 3D space. Experimental results show that the proposed camera movement approach achieves 99.9% accuracy compared to the actual camera movement path and outperforms state-of-the-art camera path estimation methods. By leveraging this accurate camera path, the system facilitates the creation of precise 3D models, making it a robust solution for applications requiring high fidelity and efficiency in 3D reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Although text-to-image generation technologies have made significant advancements, they still face challenges when dealing with ambiguous prompts and aligning outputs with user intent.Our proposed framework, TDRI (Two-Phase Dialogue Refinement and Co-Adaptation), addresses these issues by enhancing image generation through iterative user interaction. It consists of two phases: the Initial Generation Phase, which creates base images based on user prompts, and the Interactive Refinement Phase, which integrates user feedback through three key modules. The Dialogue-to-Prompt (D2P) module ensures that user feedback is effectively transformed into actionable prompts, which improves the alignment between user intent and model input. By evaluating generated outputs against user expectations, the Feedback-Reflection (FR) module identifies discrepancies and facilitates improvements. In an effort to ensure consistently high-quality results, the Adaptive Optimization (AO) module fine-tunes the generation process by balancing user preferences and maintaining prompt fidelity. Experimental results show that TDRI outperforms existing methods by achieving 33.6% human preference, compared to 6.2% for GPT-4 augmentation, and the highest CLIP and BLIP alignment scores (0.338 and 0.336, respectively). In iterative feedback tasks, user satisfaction increased to 88% after 8 rounds, with diminishing returns beyond 6 rounds. Furthermore, TDRI has been found to reduce the number of iterations and improve personalization in the creation of fashion products. TDRI exhibits a strong potential for a wide range of applications in the creative and industrial domains, as it streamlines the creative process and improves alignment with user preferences

- **Summary**: Contemporary Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) methods typically adhere to a pre-train then fine-tune regime, where a segmentation model trained on images is fine-tuned on videos. However, the lack of temporal knowledge in the pre-trained model introduces a domain gap which may adversely affect the VIS performance. To effectively bridge this gap, we present a novel video pre-training approach to enhance VIS models, especially for videos with intricate instance relationships. Our crucial innovation focuses on reducing disparities between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Specifically, we first introduce consistent pseudo-video augmentations to create diverse pseudo-video samples for pre-training while maintaining the instance consistency across frames. Then, we incorporate a multi-scale temporal module to enhance the model's ability to model temporal relations through self- and cross-attention at short- and long-term temporal spans. Our approach does not set constraints on model architecture and can integrate seamlessly with various VIS methods. Experiment results on commonly adopted VIS benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a notable 4.0% increase in average precision on the challenging OVIS dataset.

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion integrates information from distinct spectral bands to enhance image quality by leveraging the strengths and mitigating the limitations of each modality. Existing approaches typically treat image fusion and subsequent high-level tasks as separate processes, resulting in fused images that offer only marginal gains in task performance and fail to provide constructive feedback for optimizing the fusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Discriminative Cross-Dimension Evolutionary Learning Framework, termed DCEvo, which simultaneously enhances visual quality and perception accuracy. Leveraging the robust search capabilities of Evolutionary Learning, our approach formulates the optimization of dual tasks as a multi-objective problem by employing an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to dynamically balance loss function parameters. Inspired by visual neuroscience, we integrate a Discriminative Enhancer (DE) within both the encoder and decoder, enabling the effective learning of complementary features from different modalities. Additionally, our Cross-Dimensional Embedding (CDE) block facilitates mutual enhancement between high-dimensional task features and low-dimensional fusion features, ensuring a cohesive and efficient feature integration process. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 9.32% in visual quality while also enhancing subsequent high-level tasks.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel, training-free approach for enhancing alignment in Transformer-based Text-Guided Diffusion Models (TGDMs). Existing TGDMs often struggle to generate semantically aligned images, particularly when dealing with complex text prompts or multi-concept attribute binding challenges. Previous U-Net-based methods primarily optimized the latent space, but their direct application to Transformer-based architectures has shown limited effectiveness. Our method addresses these challenges by directly optimizing cross-attention maps during the generation process. Specifically, we introduce Self-Coherence Guidance, a method that dynamically refines attention maps using masks derived from previous denoising steps, ensuring precise alignment without additional training. To validate our approach, we constructed more challenging benchmarks for evaluating coarse-grained attribute binding, fine-grained attribute binding, and style binding. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method, significantly surpassing other state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. Our code is available at https://scg-diffusion.github.io/scg-diffusion.

- **Summary**: Repetitive action counting, which aims to count periodic movements in a video, is valuable for video analysis applications such as fitness monitoring. However, existing methods largely rely on regression networks with limited representational capacity, which hampers their ability to accurately capture variable periodic patterns. Additionally, their supervised learning on narrow, limited training sets leads to overfitting and restricts their ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose CountLLM, the first large language model (LLM)-based framework that takes video data and periodic text prompts as inputs and outputs the desired counting value. CountLLM leverages the rich clues from explicit textual instructions and the powerful representational capabilities of pre-trained LLMs for repetitive action counting. To effectively guide CountLLM, we develop a periodicity-based structured template for instructions that describes the properties of periodicity and implements a standardized answer format to ensure consistency. Additionally, we propose a progressive multimodal training paradigm to enhance the periodicity-awareness of the LLM. Empirical evaluations on widely recognized benchmarks demonstrate CountLLM's superior performance and generalization, particularly in handling novel and out-of-domain actions that deviate significantly from the training data, offering a promising avenue for repetitive action counting.

- **Summary**: Generative models have made remarkable advancements and are capable of producing high-quality content. However, performing controllable editing with generative models remains challenging, due to their inherent uncertainty in outputs. This challenge is praticularly pronounced in motion editing, which involves the processing of spatial information. While some physics-based generative methods have attempted to implement motion editing, they typically operate on single-view images with simple motions, such as translation and dragging. These methods struggle to handle complex rotation and stretching motions and ensure multi-view consistency, often necessitating resource-intensive retraining. To address these challenges, we propose MotionDiff, a training-free zero-shot diffusion method that leverages optical flow for complex multi-view motion editing. Specifically, given a static scene, users can interactively select objects of interest to add motion priors. The proposed Point Kinematic Model (PKM) then estimates corresponding multi-view optical flows during the Multi-view Flow Estimation Stage (MFES). Subsequently, these optical flows are utilized to generate multi-view motion results through decoupled motion representation in the Multi-view Motion Diffusion Stage (MMDS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionDiff outperforms other physics-based generative motion editing methods in achieving high-quality multi-view consistent motion results. Notably, MotionDiff does not require retraining, enabling users to conveniently adapt it for various down-stream tasks.

- **Summary**: UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world scenarios, such as small-size targets and occlusions, which limit the performance of RGB-based trackers. Multispectral images (MSI), which capture additional spectral information, offer a promising solution to these challenges. However, progress in this field has been hindered by the lack of relevant datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale Multispectral UAV Single Object Tracking dataset (MUST), which includes 250 video sequences spanning diverse environments and challenges, providing a comprehensive data foundation for multispectral UAV tracking. We also propose a novel tracking framework, UNTrack, which encodes unified spectral, spatial, and temporal features from spectrum prompts, initial templates, and sequential searches. UNTrack employs an asymmetric transformer with a spectral background eliminate mechanism for optimal relationship modeling and an encoder that continuously updates the spectrum prompt to refine tracking, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our proposed UNTrack outperforms state-of-the-art UAV trackers. We believe our dataset and framework will drive future research in this area. The dataset is available on https://github.com/q2479036243/MUST-Multispectral-UAV-Single-Object-Tracking.

- **Summary**: Restoration and enhancement are essential for improving the quality of videos captured under atmospheric turbulence conditions, aiding visualization, object detection, classification, and tracking in surveillance systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel Mamba-based method, the 3D Mamba-Based Atmospheric Turbulence Removal (MAMAT), which employs a dual-module strategy to mitigate these distortions. The first module utilizes deformable 3D convolutions for non-rigid registration to minimize spatial shifts, while the second module enhances contrast and detail. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of the 3D Mamba architecture, experimental results demonstrate that MAMAT outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based methods, achieving up to a 3\% improvement in visual quality and a 15\% boost in object detection. It not only enhances visualization but also significantly improves object detection accuracy, bridging the gap between visual restoration and the effectiveness of surveillance applications.

- **Summary**: GUI agents hold significant potential to enhance the experience and efficiency of human-device interaction. However, current methods face challenges in generalizing across applications (apps) and tasks, primarily due to two fundamental limitations in existing datasets. First, these datasets overlook developer-induced structural variations among apps, limiting the transferability of knowledge across diverse software environments. Second, many of them focus solely on navigation tasks, which restricts their capacity to represent comprehensive software architectures and complex user interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Xplore, a dataset meticulously designed to enhance cross-application and cross-task generalization via an exploration-and-reasoning framework. GUI-Xplore integrates pre-recorded exploration videos providing contextual insights, alongside five hierarchically structured downstream tasks designed to comprehensively evaluate GUI agent capabilities. To fully exploit GUI-Xplore's unique features, we propose Xplore-Agent, a GUI agent framework that combines Action-aware GUI Modeling with Graph-Guided Environment Reasoning. Further experiments indicate that Xplore-Agent achieves a 10% improvement over existing methods in unfamiliar environments, yet there remains significant potential for further enhancement towards truly generalizable GUI agents.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation allows autonomous driving cars to understand the surroundings of the vehicle comprehensively. However, it is also crucial for the model to detect obstacles that may jeopardize the safety of autonomous driving systems. Based on our experiments, we find that current uni-modal anomaly segmentation frameworks tend to produce high anomaly scores for non-anomalous regions in images. Motivated by this empirical finding, we develop a multi-modal uncertainty-based anomaly segmentation framework, named MMRAS+, for autonomous driving systems. MMRAS+ effectively reduces the high anomaly outputs of non-anomalous classes by introducing text-modal using the CLIP text encoder. Indeed, MMRAS+ is the first multi-modal anomaly segmentation solution for autonomous driving. Moreover, we develop an ensemble module to further boost the anomaly segmentation performance. Experiments on RoadAnomaly, SMIYC, and Fishyscapes validation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method. The code is available in https://github.com/HengGao12/MMRAS_plus.

- **Summary**: We present a new state of the art approach for sparse keypoint matching between pairs of images. Our method consists of a fully deep learning based approach combining a visual backbone coupled with a SplineCNN graph neural network for feature processing and a normalized transformer decoder for decoding keypoint correspondences together with the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our method is trained using a contrastive and a hyperspherical loss for better feature representations. We additionally use data augmentation during training. This comparatively simple architecture combining extensive normalization and advanced losses outperforms current state of the art approaches on PascalVOC and SPair-71k datasets by $5.1\%$ and $2.2\%$ respectively compared to BBGM, ASAR, COMMON and GMTR while training for at least $1.7x$ fewer epochs.

- **Summary**: Urban change is a constant process that influences the perception of neighbourhoods and the lives of the people within them. The field of Urban Scene Change Detection (USCD) aims to capture changes in street scenes using computer vision and can help raise awareness of changes that make it possible to better understand the city and its residents. Traditionally, the field of USCD has used supervised methods with small scale datasets. This constrains methods when applied to new cities, as it requires labour-intensive labeling processes and forces a priori definitions of relevant change. In this paper we introduce AC-1M the largest USCD dataset by far of over 1.1M images, together with EMPLACE, a self-supervising method to train a Vision Transformer using our adaptive triplet loss. We show EMPLACE outperforms SOTA methods both as a pre-training method for linear fine-tuning as well as a zero-shot setting. Lastly, in a case study of Amsterdam, we show that we are able to detect both small and large changes throughout the city and that changes uncovered by EMPLACE, depending on size, correlate with housing prices - which in turn is indicative of inequity.

- **Summary**: Open set recognition (OSR) requires models to classify known samples while detecting unknown samples for real-world applications. Existing studies show impressive progress using unknown samples from auxiliary datasets to regularize OSR models, but they have proved to be sensitive to selecting such known outliers. In this paper, we discuss the aforementioned problem from a new perspective: Can we regularize OSR models without elaborately selecting auxiliary known outliers? We first empirically and theoretically explore the role of foregrounds and backgrounds in open set recognition and disclose that: 1) backgrounds that correlate with foregrounds would mislead the model and cause failures when encounters 'partially' known images; 2) Backgrounds unrelated to foregrounds can serve as auxiliary known outliers and provide regularization via global average pooling. Based on the above insights, we propose a new method, Background Mix (BackMix), that mixes the foreground of an image with different backgrounds to remove the underlying fore-background priors. Specifically, BackMix first estimates the foreground with class activation maps (CAMs), then randomly replaces image patches with backgrounds from other images to obtain mixed images for training. With backgrounds de-correlated from foregrounds, the open set recognition performance is significantly improved. The proposed method is quite simple to implement, requires no extra operation for inferences, and can be seamlessly integrated into almost all of the existing frameworks. The code is released on https://github.com/Vanixxz/BackMix.



### Towards Invisible Backdoor Attack on Text-to-Image Diffusion Model

- **Summary**: Backdoor attacks targeting text-to-image diffusion models have advanced rapidly, enabling attackers to implant malicious triggers into these models to manipulate their outputs. However, current backdoor samples often exhibit two key abnormalities compared to benign samples: 1) Semantic Consistency, where backdoor prompts tend to generate images with similar semantic content even with significant textual variations to the prompts; 2) Attention Consistency, where the trigger induces consistent structural responses in the cross-attention maps. These consistencies leave detectable traces for defenders, making backdoors easier to identify. To enhance the stealthiness of backdoor samples, we propose a novel Invisible Backdoor Attack (IBA) by explicitly mitigating these consistencies. Specifically, our approach leverages syntactic structures as backdoor triggers to amplify the sensitivity to textual variations, effectively breaking down the semantic consistency. Besides, a regularization method based on Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KMMD) is proposed to align the distribution of cross-attention responses between backdoor and benign samples, thereby disrupting attention consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IBA achieves a 97.5% attack success rate while exhibiting stronger resistance to defenses, with an average of over 98% backdoor samples bypassing three state-of-the-art detection mechanisms.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models spurred research on personalization, i.e., a customized image synthesis, of subjects within reference images. Although existing personalization methods are able to alter the subjects' positions or to personalize multiple subjects simultaneously, they often struggle to modify the behaviors of subjects or their dynamic interactions. The difficulty is attributable to overfitting to reference images, which worsens if only a single reference image is available. We propose DynASyn, an effective multi-subject personalization from a single reference image addressing these challenges. DynASyn preserves the subject identity in the personalization process by aligning concept-based priors with subject appearances and actions. This is achieved by regularizing the attention maps between the subject token and images through concept-based priors. In addition, we propose concept-based prompt-and-image augmentation for an enhanced trade-off between identity preservation and action diversity. We adopt an SDE-based editing guided by augmented prompts to generate diverse appearances and actions while maintaining identity consistency in the augmented images. Experiments show that DynASyn is capable of synthesizing highly realistic images of subjects with novel contexts and dynamic interactions with the surroundings, and outperforms baseline methods in both quantitative and qualitative aspects.

- **Summary**: We propose Co-op, a novel method for accurately and robustly estimating the 6DoF pose of objects unseen during training from a single RGB image. Our method requires only the CAD model of the target object and can precisely estimate its pose without any additional fine-tuning. While existing model-based methods suffer from inefficiency due to using a large number of templates, our method enables fast and accurate estimation with a small number of templates. This improvement is achieved by finding semi-dense correspondences between the input image and the pre-rendered templates. Our method achieves strong generalization performance by leveraging a hybrid representation that combines patch-level classification and offset regression. Additionally, our pose refinement model estimates probabilistic flow between the input image and the rendered image, refining the initial estimate to an accurate pose using a differentiable PnP layer. We demonstrate that our method not only estimates object poses rapidly but also outperforms existing methods by a large margin on the seven core datasets of the BOP Challenge, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention in robotics for its explicit, high fidelity dense scene representation, demonstrating strong potential for robotic applications. However, 3DGS-based methods in robotics primarily focus on static scenes, with limited attention to the dynamic scene changes essential for long-term service robots. These robots demand sustained task execution and efficient scene updates-challenges current approaches fail to meet. To address these limitations, we propose GS-LTS (Gaussian Splatting for Long-Term Service), a 3DGS-based system enabling indoor robots to manage diverse tasks in dynamic environments over time. GS-LTS detects scene changes (e.g., object addition or removal) via single-image change detection, employs a rule-based policy to autonomously collect multi-view observations, and efficiently updates the scene representation through Gaussian editing. Additionally, we propose a simulation-based benchmark that automatically generates scene change data as compact configuration scripts, providing a standardized, user-friendly evaluation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate GS-LTS's advantages in reconstruction, navigation, and superior scene updates-faster and higher quality than the image training baseline-advancing 3DGS for long-term robotic operations.

- **Summary**: Recently, great progress has been made in video generation technology, attracting the widespread attention of scholars. To apply this technology to downstream applications under resource-constrained conditions, researchers usually fine-tune the pre-trained models based on parameter-efficient tuning methods such as Adapter or Lora. Although these methods can transfer the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, fewer training parameters lead to poor fitting ability, and the knowledge from the source domain may lead to the inference process deviating from the target domain. In this paper, we argue that under constrained resources, training a smaller video generation model from scratch using only million-level samples can outperform parameter-efficient tuning on larger models in downstream applications: the core lies in the effective utilization of data and curriculum strategy. Take animated sticker generation (ASG) as a case study, we first construct a discrete frame generation network for stickers with low frame rates, ensuring that its parameters meet the requirements of model training under constrained resources. In order to provide data support for models trained from scratch, we come up with a dual-mask based data utilization strategy, which manages to improve the availability and expand the diversity of limited data. To facilitate convergence under dual-mask situation, we propose a difficulty-adaptive curriculum learning method, which decomposes the sample entropy into static and adaptive components so as to obtain samples from easy to difficult. The experiment demonstrates that our resource-efficient dual-mask training framework is quantitatively and qualitatively superior to efficient-parameter tuning methods such as I2V-Adapter and SimDA, verifying the feasibility of our method on downstream tasks under constrained resources. Code will be available.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in the field of video understanding recently. However, current benchmarks uniformly lean on text prompts for evaluation, which often necessitate complex referential language and fail to provide precise spatial and temporal references. This limitation diminishes the experience and efficiency of human-model interaction. To address this limitation, we propose the Video Visual Prompt Benchmark(V2P-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' video understanding capabilities in multimodal human-model interaction scenarios. V2P-Bench includes 980 unique videos and 1,172 QA pairs, covering 5 main tasks and 12 dimensions, facilitating instance-level fine-grained understanding aligned with human cognition. Benchmarking results reveal that even the most powerful models perform poorly on V2P-Bench (65.4% for GPT-4o and 67.9% for Gemini-1.5-Pro), significantly lower than the human experts' 88.3%, highlighting the current shortcomings of LVLMs in understanding video visual prompts. We hope V2P-Bench will serve as a foundation for advancing multimodal human-model interaction and video understanding evaluation. Project page: https://github.com/gaotiexinqu/V2P-Bench.

- **Summary**: Fine-tuning large pre-trained vision foundation models in a parameter-efficient manner is critical for downstream vision tasks, considering the practical constraints of computational and storage costs. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a well-established technique in this domain, achieving impressive efficiency by reducing the parameter space to a low-rank form. However, developing more advanced low-rank adaptation methods to reduce parameters and memory requirements remains a significant challenge in resource-constrained application scenarios. In this study, we consider on top of the commonly used vision transformer and propose Serial LoRA, a novel LoRA variant that introduces a shared low-rank matrix serially composite with the attention mechanism. Such a design extracts the underlying commonality of parameters in adaptation, significantly reducing redundancy. Notably, Serial LoRA uses only 1/4 parameters of LoRA but achieves comparable performance in most cases. We conduct extensive experiments on a range of vision foundation models with the transformer structure, and the results confirm consistent superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in autonomous driving. In recent years, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity due to their significant reduction in annotation labor and time costs. Current semi-supervised methods typically focus on point cloud spatial distribution or consider short-term temporal representations, e.g., only two adjacent frames, often overlooking the rich long-term temporal properties inherent in autonomous driving scenarios. In driving experience, we observe that nearby objects, such as roads and vehicles, remain stable while driving, whereas distant objects exhibit greater variability in category and shape. This natural phenomenon is also captured by LiDAR, which reflects lower temporal sensitivity for nearby objects and higher sensitivity for distant ones. To leverage these characteristics, we propose HiLoTs, which learns high-temporal sensitivity and low-temporal sensitivity representations from continuous LiDAR frames. These representations are further enhanced and fused using a cross-attention mechanism. Additionally, we employ a teacher-student framework to align the representations learned by the labeled and unlabeled branches, effectively utilizing the large amounts of unlabeled data. Experimental results on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiLoTs outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, and achieves performance close to LiDAR+Camera multimodal approaches.

- **Summary**: Discrete visual tokenizers transform images into a sequence of tokens, enabling token-based visual generation akin to language models. However, this process is inherently challenging, as it requires both compressing visual signals into a compact representation and discretizing them into a fixed set of codes. Traditional discrete tokenizers typically learn the two tasks jointly, often leading to unstable training, low codebook utilization, and limited reconstruction quality. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CODA}(\textbf{CO}ntinuous-to-\textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{A}daptation), a framework that decouples compression and discretization. Instead of training discrete tokenizers from scratch, CODA adapts off-the-shelf continuous VAEs -- already optimized for perceptual compression -- into discrete tokenizers via a carefully designed discretization process. By primarily focusing on discretization, CODA ensures stable and efficient training while retaining the strong visual fidelity of continuous VAEs. Empirically, with $\mathbf{6 \times}$ less training budget than standard VQGAN, our approach achieves a remarkable codebook utilization of 100% and notable reconstruction FID (rFID) of $\mathbf{0.43}$ and $\mathbf{1.34}$ for $8 \times$ and $16 \times$ compression on ImageNet 256$\times$ 256 benchmark.

- **Summary**: Obtaining high-resolution hyperspectral images (HR-HSI) is costly and data-intensive, making it necessary to fuse low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) with high-resolution RGB images (HR-RGB) for practical applications. However, traditional fusion techniques, which integrate detailed information into the reconstruction, significantly increase bandwidth consumption compared to directly transmitting raw data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchy-aware and channel-adaptive semantic communication approach for bandwidth-limited data fusion. A hierarchical correlation module is proposed to preserve both the overall structural information and the details of the image required for super-resolution. This module efficiently combines deep semantic and shallow features from LR-HSI and HR-RGB. To further reduce bandwidth usage while preserving reconstruction quality, a channel-adaptive attention mechanism based on Transformer is proposed to dynamically integrate and transmit the deep and shallow features, enabling efficient data transmission and high-quality HR-HSI reconstruction. Experimental results on the CAVE and Washington DC Mall datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms single-source transmission, achieving up to a 2 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Additionally, it reduces bandwidth consumption by two-thirds, confirming its effectiveness in bandwidth-constrained environments for HR-HSI reconstruction tasks.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models like CLIP have shown impressive capabilities in aligning images and text, but they often struggle with lengthy and detailed text descriptions because of their training focus on short and concise captions. We present GOAL (Global-local Object Alignment Learning), a novel fine-tuning method that enhances CLIP's ability to handle lengthy text by leveraging both global and local semantic alignments between image and lengthy text. Our approach consists of two key components: Local Image-Sentence Matching (LISM), which identifies corresponding pairs between image segments and descriptive sentences, and Token Similarity-based Learning (TSL), which efficiently propagates local element attention through these matched pairs. Evaluating GOAL on three new benchmarks for image-lengthy text retrieval, we demonstrate significant improvements over baseline CLIP fine-tuning, establishing a simple yet effective approach for adapting CLIP to detailed textual descriptions. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method's focus on local semantic alignment alongside global context leads to more nuanced and representative embeddings, particularly beneficial for tasks requiring fine-grained understanding of lengthy text descriptions.

We aim to answer the following questions: 1) Do the readers improve their performance when assisted by the AI algorithm? 2) How much does the AI algorithm impact routine clinical workflow? We reuse and enlarge our open-access, Time-Of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography dataset (N=460). We use 360 subjects for training/validating our algorithm and 100 as unseen test set for the reading session. Even though our model reaches state-of-the-art results on the test set (sensitivity=74%, false positive rate=1.6), we show that neither the junior nor the senior reader significantly increase their sensitivity (p=0.59, p=1, respectively). In addition, we find that reading time for both readers is significantly higher in the "AI-assisted" setting than in the "Unassisted" (+15 seconds, on average; p=3x10^(-4) junior, p=3x10^(-5) senior). The confidence reported by the readers is unchanged across the two settings, indicating that the AI assistance does not influence the certainty of the diagnosis. Our findings highlight the importance of clinical validation of AI algorithms in a clinical setting involving radiologists. This study should serve as a reminder to the community to always examine the real-word effectiveness and workflow impact of proposed algorithms.

- **Summary**: Two-hand reconstruction from monocular images faces persistent challenges due to complex and dynamic hand postures and occlusions, causing significant difficulty in achieving plausible interaction alignment. Existing approaches struggle with such alignment issues, often resulting in misalignment and penetration artifacts. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework that attempts to precisely align hand poses and interactions by synergistically integrating foundation model-driven 2D priors with diffusion-based interaction refinement for occlusion-resistant two-hand reconstruction. First, we introduce a Fusion Alignment Encoder that learns to align fused multimodal priors keypoints, segmentation maps, and depth cues from foundation models during training. This provides robust structured guidance, further enabling efficient inference without foundation models at test time while maintaining high reconstruction accuracy. Second, we employ a two-hand diffusion model explicitly trained to transform interpenetrated poses into plausible, non-penetrated interactions, leveraging gradient-guided denoising to correct artifacts and ensure realistic spatial relations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on InterHand2.6M, FreiHAND, and HIC datasets, significantly advancing occlusion handling and interaction robustness.

- **Summary**: Variational models are widely used in image segmentation, with various models designed to address different types of images by optimizing specific objective functionals. However, traditional segmentation models primarily focus on the visual attributes of the image, often neglecting the topological properties of the target objects. This limitation can lead to segmentation results that deviate from the ground truth, particularly in images with complex topological structures. In this paper, we introduce a topology-preserving constraint into the iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM), resulting in the topology-preserving ICTM (TP-ICTM). Extensive experiments demonstrate that, by explicitly preserving the topological properties of target objects-such as connectivity-the proposed algorithm achieves enhanced accuracy and robustness, particularly in images with intricate structures or noise.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generative models often struggle with long prompts detailing complex scenes, diverse objects with distinct visual characteristics and spatial relationships. In this work, we propose SCoPE (Scheduled interpolation of Coarse-to-fine Prompt Embeddings), a training-free method to improve text-to-image alignment by progressively refining the input prompt in a coarse-to-fine-grained manner. Given a detailed input prompt, we first decompose it into multiple sub-prompts which evolve from describing broad scene layout to highly intricate details. During inference, we interpolate between these sub-prompts and thus progressively introduce finer-grained details into the generated image. Our training-free plug-and-play approach significantly enhances prompt alignment, achieves an average improvement of up to +4% in Visual Question Answering (VQA) scores over the Stable Diffusion baselines on 85% of the prompts from the GenAI-Bench dataset.

- **Summary**: Recent developments in 3D reconstruction and neural rendering have significantly propelled the capabilities of photo-realistic 3D scene rendering across various academic and industrial fields. The 3D Gaussian Splatting technique, alongside its derivatives, integrates the advantages of primitive-based and volumetric representations to deliver top-tier rendering quality and efficiency. Despite these advancements, the method tends to generate excessive redundant noisy Gaussians overfitted to every training view, which degrades the rendering quality. Additionally, while 3D Gaussian Splatting excels in small-scale and object-centric scenes, its application to larger scenes is hindered by constraints such as limited video memory, excessive optimization duration, and variable appearance across views. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFocus, an innovative approach that incorporates a patch attention algorithm to refine rendering quality and implements a Gaussian constraints strategy to minimize redundancy. Moreover, we propose a subdivision reconstruction strategy for large-scale scenes, dividing them into smaller, manageable blocks for individual training. Our results indicate that GaussianFocus significantly reduces unnecessary Gaussians and enhances rendering quality, surpassing existing State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to effectively manage and render large scenes, such as urban environments, whilst maintaining high fidelity in the visual output.

- **Summary**: Directly reconstructing 3D CT volume from few-view 2D X-rays using an end-to-end deep learning network is a challenging task, as X-ray images are merely projection views of the 3D CT volume. In this work, we facilitate complex 2D X-ray image to 3D CT mapping by incorporating new view synthesis, and reduce the learning difficulty through view-guided feature alignment. Specifically, we propose a dual-view guided diffusion model (DVG-Diffusion), which couples a real input X-ray view and a synthesized new X-ray view to jointly guide CT reconstruction. First, a novel view parameter-guided encoder captures features from X-rays that are spatially aligned with CT. Next, we concatenate the extracted dual-view features as conditions for the latent diffusion model to learn and refine the CT latent representation. Finally, the CT latent representation is decoded into a CT volume in pixel space. By incorporating view parameter guided encoding and dual-view guided CT reconstruction, our DVG-Diffusion can achieve an effective balance between high fidelity and perceptual quality for CT reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Based on experiments, the comprehensive analysis and discussions for views and reconstruction are also presented.

- **Summary**: Scene coordinate regression achieves impressive results in outdoor LiDAR localization but requires days of training. Since training needs to be repeated for each new scene, long training times make these methods impractical for time-sensitive applications, such as autonomous driving, drones, and robotics. We identify large coverage areas and vast data in large-scale outdoor scenes as key challenges that limit fast training. In this paper, we propose LightLoc, the first method capable of efficiently learning localization in a new scene at light speed. LightLoc introduces two novel techniques to address these challenges. First, we introduce sample classification guidance to assist regression learning, reducing ambiguity from similar samples and improving training efficiency. Second, we propose redundant sample downsampling to remove well-learned frames during training, reducing training time without compromising accuracy. Additionally, the fast training and confidence estimation capabilities of sample classification enable its integration into SLAM, effectively eliminating error accumulation. Extensive experiments on large-scale outdoor datasets demonstrate that LightLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 50x reduction in training time than existing methods.

- **Summary**: Interactive segmentation aims to segment the specified target on the image with positive and negative clicks from users. Interactive ambiguity is a crucial issue in this field, which refers to the possibility of multiple compliant outcomes with the same clicks, such as selecting a part of an object versus the entire object, a single object versus a combination of multiple objects, and so on. The existing methods cannot provide intuitive guidance to the model, which leads to unstable output results and makes it difficult to meet the large-scale and efficient annotation requirements for specific targets in some scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RefCut, a reference-based interactive segmentation framework designed to address part ambiguity and object ambiguity in segmenting specific targets. Users only need to provide a reference image and corresponding reference masks, and the model will be optimized based on them, which greatly reduces the interactive burden on users when annotating a large number of such targets. In addition, to enrich these two kinds of ambiguous data, we propose a new Target Disassembly Dataset which contains two subsets of part disassembly and object disassembly for evaluation. In the combination evaluation of multiple datasets, our RefCut achieved state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments and visualized results demonstrate that RefCut advances the field of intuitive and controllable interactive segmentation. Our code will be publicly available and the demo video is in https://www.lin-zheng.com/refcut.

- **Summary**: While vision transformers achieve significant breakthroughs in various image restoration (IR) tasks, it is still challenging to efficiently scale them across multiple types of degradations and resolutions. In this paper, we propose Fractal-IR, a fractal-based design that progressively refines degraded images by repeatedly expanding local information into broader regions. This fractal architecture naturally captures local details at early stages and seamlessly transitions toward global context in deeper fractal stages, removing the need for computationally heavy long-range self-attention mechanisms. Moveover, we observe the challenge in scaling up vision transformers for IR tasks. Through a series of analyses, we identify a holistic set of strategies to effectively guide model scaling. Extensive experimental results show that Fractal-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, denoising, JPEG artifact removal, IR in adverse weather conditions, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, and demosaicking. For $2\times$ SR on Manga109, Fractal-IR achieves a 0.21 dB PSNR gain. For grayscale image denoising on Urban100, Fractal-IR surpasses the previous method by 0.2 dB for $\sigma=50$.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive 2D image/video understanding capabilities. However, there are no publicly standardized benchmarks to assess the abilities of MLLMs in understanding the 4D objects (3D objects with temporal evolution over time). In this paper, we introduce 4D-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in 4D object understanding, featuring tasks in 4D object Question Answering (4D object QA) and 4D object captioning. 4D-Bench provides 4D objects with diverse categories, high-quality annotations, and tasks necessitating multi-view spatial-temporal understanding, different from existing 2D image/video-based benchmarks. With 4D-Bench, we evaluate a wide range of open-source and closed-source MLLMs. The results from the 4D object captioning experiment indicate that MLLMs generally exhibit weaker temporal understanding compared to their appearance understanding, notably, while open-source models approach closed-source performance in appearance understanding, they show larger performance gaps in temporal understanding. 4D object QA yields surprising findings: even with simple single-object videos, MLLMs perform poorly, with state-of-the-art GPT-4o achieving only 63\% accuracy compared to the human baseline of 91\%. These findings highlight a substantial gap in 4D object understanding and the need for further advancements in MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in ophthalmology foundation models such as RetFound have demonstrated remarkable diagnostic capabilities but require massive datasets for effective pre-training, creating significant barriers for development and deployment. To address this critical challenge, we propose FundusGAN, a novel hierarchical feature-aware generative framework specifically designed for high-fidelity fundus image synthesis. Our approach leverages a Feature Pyramid Network within its encoder to comprehensively extract multi-scale information, capturing both large anatomical structures and subtle pathological features. The framework incorporates a modified StyleGAN-based generator with dilated convolutions and strategic upsampling adjustments to preserve critical retinal structures while enhancing pathological detail representation. Comprehensive evaluations on the DDR, DRIVE, and IDRiD datasets demonstrate that FundusGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics (SSIM: 0.8863, FID: 54.2, KID: 0.0436 on DDR). Furthermore, disease classification experiments reveal that augmenting training data with FundusGAN-generated images significantly improves diagnostic accuracy across multiple CNN architectures (up to 6.49\% improvement with ResNet50). These results establish FundusGAN as a valuable foundation model component that effectively addresses data scarcity challenges in ophthalmological AI research, enabling more robust and generalizable diagnostic systems while reducing dependency on large-scale clinical data collection.

- **Summary**: The development of aerial holistic scene understanding algorithms is hindered by the scarcity of comprehensive datasets that enable both semantic and geometric reconstruction. While synthetic datasets offer an alternative, existing options exhibit task-specific limitations, unrealistic scene compositions, and rendering artifacts that compromise real-world applicability. We introduce ClaraVid, a synthetic aerial dataset specifically designed to overcome these limitations. Comprising 16,917 high-resolution images captured at 4032x3024 from multiple viewpoints across diverse landscapes, ClaraVid provides dense depth maps, panoptic segmentation, sparse point clouds, and dynamic object masks, while mitigating common rendering artifacts. To further advance neural reconstruction, we introduce the Delentropic Scene Profile (DSP), a novel complexity metric derived from differential entropy analysis, designed to quantitatively assess scene difficulty and inform reconstruction tasks. Utilizing DSP, we systematically benchmark neural reconstruction methods, uncovering a consistent, measurable correlation between scene complexity and reconstruction accuracy. Empirical results indicate that higher delentropy strongly correlates with increased reconstruction errors, validating DSP as a reliable complexity prior. Currently under review, upon acceptance the data and code will be available at $\href{https://rdbch.github.io/claravid}{rdbch.github.io/ClaraVid}$.

- **Summary**: While recent debiasing methods for Scene Graph Generation (SGG) have shown impressive performance, these efforts often attribute model bias solely to the long-tail distribution of relationships, overlooking the more profound causes stemming from skewed object and object pair distributions. In this paper, we employ causal inference techniques to model the causality among these observed skewed distributions. Our insight lies in the ability of causal inference to capture the unobservable causal effects between complex distributions, which is crucial for tracing the roots of model bias. Specifically, we introduce the Mediator-based Causal Chain Model (MCCM), which, in addition to modeling causality among objects, object pairs, and relationships, incorporates mediator variables, i.e., cooccurrence distribution, for complementing the causality. Following this, we propose the Causal Adjustment Module (CAModule) to estimate the modeled causal structure, using variables from MCCM as inputs to produce a set of adjustment factors aimed at correcting biased model predictions. Moreover, our method enables the composition of zero-shot relationships, thereby enhancing the model's ability to recognize such relationships. Experiments conducted across various SGG backbones and popular benchmarks demonstrate that CAModule achieves state-of-the-art mean recall rates, with significant improvements also observed on the challenging zero-shot recall rate metric.

- **Summary**: Composed image retrieval (CIR) enables users to search images using a reference image combined with textual modifications. Recent advances in vision-language models have improved CIR, but dataset limitations remain a barrier. Existing datasets often rely on simplistic, ambiguous, or insufficient manual annotations, hindering fine-grained retrieval. We introduce good4cir, a structured pipeline leveraging vision-language models to generate high-quality synthetic annotations. Our method involves: (1) extracting fine-grained object descriptions from query images, (2) generating comparable descriptions for target images, and (3) synthesizing textual instructions capturing meaningful transformations between images. This reduces hallucination, enhances modification diversity, and ensures object-level consistency. Applying our method improves existing datasets and enables creating new datasets across diverse domains. Results demonstrate improved retrieval accuracy for CIR models trained on our pipeline-generated datasets. We release our dataset construction framework to support further research in CIR and multi-modal retrieval.

- **Summary**: Sea ice plays a critical role in the global climate system and maritime operations, making timely and accurate classification essential. However, traditional manual methods are time-consuming, costly, and have inherent biases. Automating sea ice type classification addresses these challenges by enabling faster, more consistent, and scalable analysis. While both traditional and deep learning approaches have been explored, deep learning models offer a promising direction for improving efficiency and consistency in sea ice classification. However, the absence of a standardized benchmark and comparative study prevents a clear consensus on the best-performing models. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textit{IceBench}, a comprehensive benchmarking framework for sea ice type classification. Our key contributions are threefold: First, we establish the IceBench benchmarking framework which leverages the existing AI4Arctic Sea Ice Challenge dataset as a standardized dataset, incorporates a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, and includes representative models from the entire spectrum of sea ice type classification methods categorized in two distinct groups, namely, pixel-based classification methods and patch-based classification methods. IceBench is open-source and allows for convenient integration and evaluation of other sea ice type classification methods; hence, facilitating comparative evaluation of new methods and improving reproducibility in the field. Second, we conduct an in-depth comparative study on representative models to assess their strengths and limitations, providing insights for both practitioners and researchers. Third, we leverage IceBench for systematic experiments addressing key research questions on model transferability across seasons (time) and locations (space), data downscaling, and preprocessing strategies.
