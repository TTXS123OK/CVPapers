- **Summary**: Long video generation remains a challenging and compelling topic in computer vision. Diffusion based models, among the various approaches to video generation, have achieved state of the art quality with their iterative denoising procedures. However, the intrinsic complexity of the video domain renders the training of such diffusion models exceedingly expensive in terms of both data curation and computational resources. Moreover, these models typically operate on a fixed noise tensor that represents the video, resulting in predetermined spatial and temporal dimensions. Although several high quality open-source pretrained video diffusion models, jointly trained on images and videos of varying lengths and resolutions, are available, it is generally not recommended to specify a video length at inference that was not included in the training set. Consequently, these models are not readily adaptable to the direct generation of longer videos by merely increasing the specified video length. In addition to feasibility challenges, long-video generation also encounters quality issues. The domain of long videos is inherently more complex than that of short videos: extended durations introduce greater variability and necessitate long-range temporal consistency, thereby increasing the overall difficulty of the task. We propose VideoMerge, a training-free method that can be seamlessly adapted to merge short videos generated by pretrained text-to-video diffusion model. Our approach preserves the model's original expressiveness and consistency while allowing for extended duration and dynamic variation as specified by the user. By leveraging the strengths of pretrained models, our method addresses challenges related to smoothness, consistency, and dynamic content through orthogonal strategies that operate collaboratively to achieve superior quality.

- **Summary**: Human emotion recognition plays a crucial role in facilitating seamless interactions between humans and computers. In this paper, we present our innovative methodology for tackling the Valence-Arousal (VA) Estimation Challenge, the Expression Recognition Challenge, and the Action Unit (AU) Detection Challenge, all within the framework of the 8th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW).   Our approach introduces a novel framework aimed at enhancing continuous emotion recognition. This is achieved by fine-tuning the CLIP model with the aff-wild2 dataset, which provides annotated expression labels. The result is a fine-tuned model that serves as an efficient visual feature extractor, significantly improving its robustness. To further boost the performance of continuous emotion recognition, we incorporate Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) modules alongside Transformer Encoder modules into our system architecture. The integration of these advanced components allows our model to outperform baseline performance, demonstrating its ability to recognize human emotions with greater accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) tasks require agents to navigate three-dimensional environments guided by natural language instructions, offering substantial potential for diverse applications. However, the scarcity of training data impedes progress in this field. This paper introduces PanoGen++, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by generating varied and pertinent panoramic environments for VLN tasks. PanoGen++ incorporates pre-trained diffusion models with domain-specific fine-tuning, employing parameter-efficient techniques such as low-rank adaptation to minimize computational costs. We investigate two settings for environment generation: masked image inpainting and recursive image outpainting. The former maximizes novel environment creation by inpainting masked regions based on textual descriptions, while the latter facilitates agents' learning of spatial relationships within panoramas. Empirical evaluations on room-to-room (R2R), room-for-room (R4R), and cooperative vision-and-dialog navigation (CVDN) datasets reveal significant performance enhancements: a 2.44% increase in success rate on the R2R test leaderboard, a 0.63% improvement on the R4R validation unseen set, and a 0.75-meter enhancement in goal progress on the CVDN validation unseen set. PanoGen++ augments the diversity and relevance of training environments, resulting in improved generalization and efficacy in VLN tasks.

- **Summary**: 3D semantic occupancy has rapidly become a research focus in the fields of robotics and autonomous driving environment perception due to its ability to provide more realistic geometric perception and its closer integration with downstream tasks. By performing occupancy prediction of the 3D space in the environment, the ability and robustness of scene understanding can be effectively improved. However, existing occupancy prediction tasks are primarily modeled using voxel or point cloud-based approaches: voxel-based network structures often suffer from the loss of spatial information due to the voxelization process, while point cloud-based methods, although better at retaining spatial location information, face limitations in representing volumetric structural details. To address this issue, we propose a dual-modal prediction method based on 3D Gaussian sets and sparse points, which balances both spatial location and volumetric structural information, achieving higher accuracy in semantic occupancy prediction. Specifically, our method adopts a Transformer-based architecture, taking 3D Gaussian sets, sparse points, and queries as inputs. Through the multi-layer structure of the Transformer, the enhanced queries and 3D Gaussian sets jointly contribute to the semantic occupancy prediction, and an adaptive fusion mechanism integrates the semantic outputs of both modalities to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, to further improve accuracy, we dynamically refine the point cloud at each layer, allowing for more precise location information during occupancy prediction. We conducted experiments on the Occ3DnuScenes dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method on IoU based metrics.

- **Summary**: Co-speech gesture video synthesis is a challenging task that requires both probabilistic modeling of human gestures and the synthesis of realistic images that align with the rhythmic nuances of speech. To address these challenges, we propose Cosh-DiT, a Co-speech gesture video system with hybrid Diffusion Transformers that perform audio-to-motion and motion-to-video synthesis using discrete and continuous diffusion modeling, respectively. First, we introduce an audio Diffusion Transformer (Cosh-DiT-A) to synthesize expressive gesture dynamics synchronized with speech rhythms. To capture upper body, facial, and hand movement priors, we employ vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) to jointly learn their dependencies within a discrete latent space. Then, for realistic video synthesis conditioned on the generated speech-driven motion, we design a visual Diffusion Transformer (Cosh-DiT-V) that effectively integrates spatial and temporal contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently generates lifelike videos with expressive facial expressions and natural, smooth gestures that align seamlessly with speech.

- **Summary**: With the rapid growth of video generative models (VGMs), it is essential to develop reliable and comprehensive automatic metrics for AI-generated videos (AIGVs). Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 16 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the problem of human trajectory forecasting, which aims to predict the inherently multi-modal future movements of humans based on their past trajectories and other contextual cues. We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance. These models can generate diverse trajectories that are physically and socially plausible. Moreover, our one-step student model is $\textbf{100}$ times faster than the teacher flow model during sampling.

- **Summary**: The trackers based on lightweight neural networks have achieved great success in the field of aerial remote sensing, most of which aggregate multi-stage deep features to lift the tracking quality. However, existing algorithms usually only generate single-stage fusion features for state decision, which ignore that diverse kinds of features are required for identifying and locating the object, limiting the robustness and precision of tracking. In this paper, we propose a novel target-aware Bidirectional Fusion transformer (BFTrans) for UAV tracking. Specifically, we first present a two-stream fusion network based on linear self and cross attentions, which can combine the shallow and the deep features from both forward and backward directions, providing the adjusted local details for location and global semantics for recognition. Besides, a target-aware positional encoding strategy is designed for the above fusion model, which is helpful to perceive the object-related attributes during the fusion phase. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on several popular UAV benchmarks, including UAV-123, UAV20L and UAVTrack112. Massive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can exceed other state-of-the-art trackers and run with an average speed of 30.5 FPS on embedded platform, which is appropriate for practical drone deployments.

- **Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, have gained significant attention for their exceptional capabilities in natural language processing and multimodal data understanding. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has driven the growing need for intelligence, efficient, and adaptable wireless networks. Wireless networks require the empowerment of RL-based LLMs while these models also benefit from wireless networks to broaden their application scenarios. Specifically, RL-based LLMs can enhance wireless communication systems through intelligent resource allocation, adaptive network optimization, and real-time decision-making. Conversely, wireless networks provide a vital infrastructure for the efficient training, deployment, and distributed inference of RL-based LLMs, especially in decentralized and edge computing environments. This mutual empowerment highlights the need for a deeper exploration of the interplay between these two domains. We first review recent advancements in wireless communications, highlighting the associated challenges and potential solutions. We then discuss the progress of RL-based LLMs, focusing on key technologies for LLM training, challenges, and potential solutions. Subsequently, we explore the mutual empowerment between these two fields, highlighting key motivations, open challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we provide insights into future directions, applications, and their societal impact to further explore this intersection, paving the way for next-generation intelligent communication systems. Overall, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between RL-based LLMs and wireless networks, offering a vision where these domains empower each other to drive innovations.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the images of an interested person based on textual descriptions. One main challenge for this task is the high cost in manually annotating large-scale databases, which affects the generalization ability of ReID models. Recent works handle this problem by leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to describe pedestrian images automatically. However, the captions produced by MLLMs lack diversity in description styles. To address this issue, we propose a Human Annotator Modeling (HAM) approach to enable MLLMs to mimic the description styles of thousands of human annotators. Specifically, we first extract style features from human textual descriptions and perform clustering on them. This allows us to group textual descriptions with similar styles into the same cluster. Then, we employ a prompt to represent each of these clusters and apply prompt learning to mimic the description styles of different human annotators. Furthermore, we define a style feature space and perform uniform sampling in this space to obtain more diverse clustering prototypes, which further enriches the diversity of the MLLM-generated captions. Finally, we adopt HAM to automatically annotate a massive-scale database for text-to-image ReID. Extensive experiments on this database demonstrate that it significantly improves the generalization ability of ReID models.

- **Summary**: Correlation of neuropathology with MRI has the potential to transfer microscopic signatures of pathology to invivo scans. Recently, a classical registration method has been proposed, to build these correlations from 3D reconstructed stacks of dissection photographs, which are routinely taken at brain banks. These photographs bypass the need for exvivo MRI, which is not widely accessible. However, this method requires a full stack of brain slabs and a reference mask (e.g., acquired with a surface scanner), which severely limits the applicability of the technique. Here we propose RefFree, a dissection photograph reconstruction method without external reference. RefFree is a learning approach that estimates the 3D coordinates in the atlas space for every pixel in every photograph; simple least-squares fitting can then be used to compute the 3D reconstruction. As a by-product, RefFree also produces an atlas-based segmentation of the reconstructed stack. RefFree is trained on synthetic photographs generated from digitally sliced 3D MRI data, with randomized appearance for enhanced generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real data show that RefFree achieves performance comparable to the baseline method without an explicit reference while also enabling reconstruction of partial stacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/lintian-a/reffree.



### Style Evolving along Chain-of-Thought for Unknown-Domain Object Detection

- **Summary**: Recently, a task of Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD) is proposed, aiming to generalize a detector to multiple unknown domains never seen before during training. Due to the unavailability of target-domain data, some methods leverage the multimodal capabilities of vision-language models, using textual prompts to estimate cross-domain information, enhancing the model's generalization capability. These methods typically use a single textual prompt, often referred to as the one-step prompt method. However, when dealing with complex styles such as the combination of rain and night, we observe that the performance of the one-step prompt method tends to be relatively weak. The reason may be that many scenes incorporate not just a single style but a combination of multiple styles. The one-step prompt method may not effectively synthesize combined information involving various styles. To address this limitation, we propose a new method, i.e., Style Evolving along Chain-of-Thought, which aims to progressively integrate and expand style information along the chain of thought, enabling the continual evolution of styles. Specifically, by progressively refining style descriptions and guiding the diverse evolution of styles, this approach enables more accurate simulation of various style characteristics and helps the model gradually learn and adapt to subtle differences between styles. Additionally, it exposes the model to a broader range of style features with different data distributions, thereby enhancing its generalization capability in unseen domains. The significant performance gains over five adverse-weather scenarios and the Real to Art benchmark demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

- **Summary**: Data-driven AI is establishing itself at the center of evidence-based medicine. However, reports of shortcomings and unexpected behavior are growing due to AI's reliance on association-based learning. A major reason for this behavior: latent bias in machine learning datasets can be amplified during training and/or hidden during testing. We present a data modality-agnostic auditing framework for generating targeted hypotheses about sources of bias which we refer to as Generalized Attribute Utility and Detectability-Induced bias Testing (G-AUDIT) for datasets. Our method examines the relationship between task-level annotations and data properties including protected attributes (e.g., race, age, sex) and environment and acquisition characteristics (e.g., clinical site, imaging protocols). G-AUDIT automatically quantifies the extent to which the observed data attributes may enable shortcut learning, or in the case of testing data, hide predictions made based on spurious associations. We demonstrate the broad applicability and value of our method by analyzing large-scale medical datasets for three distinct modalities and learning tasks: skin lesion classification in images, stigmatizing language classification in Electronic Health Records (EHR), and mortality prediction for ICU tabular data. In each setting, G-AUDIT successfully identifies subtle biases commonly overlooked by traditional qualitative methods that focus primarily on social and ethical objectives, underscoring its practical value in exposing dataset-level risks and supporting the downstream development of reliable AI systems. Our method paves the way for achieving deeper understanding of machine learning datasets throughout the AI development life-cycle from initial prototyping all the way to regulation, and creates opportunities to reduce model bias, enabling safer and more trustworthy AI systems.

- **Summary**: Current Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) adopts the pseudo-labeling strategy and further filters pseudo-labels based on confidence thresholds. However, this mechanism has notable drawbacks: 1) setting the reasonable threshold is an open problem which significantly influences the selection of the high-quality pseudo-labels; and 2) deep models often exhibit the over-confidence phenomenon which makes the confidence value an unreliable indicator for assessing the quality of pseudo-labels due to the scarcity of labeled data. In this paper, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Ensemble Structure (UES) to assess the utility of pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples. We further model the utility of pseudo-labels as long-tailed weights to avoid the open problem of setting the threshold. Concretely, the advantage of the long-tailed weights ensures that even unreliable pseudo-labels still contribute to enhancing the model's robustness. Besides, UES is lightweight and architecture-agnostic, easily extending to various computer vision tasks, including classification and regression. Experimental results demonstrate that combining the proposed method with DualPose leads to a 3.47% improvement in Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) on the Sniffing dataset with 100 data points (30 labeled), a 7.29\% improvement in PCK on the FLIC dataset with 100 data points (50 labeled), and a 3.91% improvement in PCK on the LSP dataset with 200 data points (100 labeled). Furthermore, when combined with FixMatch, the proposed method achieves a 0.2% accuracy improvement on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 40 labeled data points and a 0.26% accuracy improvement on the CIFAR-100 dataset with 400 labeled data points.

- **Summary**: In recent years, quadruped robotics has advanced significantly, particularly in perception and motion control via reinforcement learning, enabling complex motions in challenging environments. Visual sensors like depth cameras enhance stability and robustness but face limitations, such as low operating frequencies relative to joint control and sensitivity to lighting, which hinder outdoor deployment. Additionally, deep neural networks in sensor and control systems increase computational demands. To address these issues, we introduce spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event cameras to perform a challenging quadruped parkour task. Event cameras capture dynamic visual data, while SNNs efficiently process spike sequences, mimicking biological perception. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms traditional models, achieving excellent parkour performance with just 11.7% of the energy consumption of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model, yielding an 88.3% energy reduction. By integrating event cameras with SNNs, our work advances robotic reinforcement learning and opens new possibilities for applications in demanding environments.

- **Summary**: Hi-C technology measures genome-wide interaction frequencies, providing a powerful tool for studying the 3D genomic structure within the nucleus. However, high sequencing costs and technical challenges often result in Hi-C data with limited coverage, leading to imprecise estimates of chromatin interaction frequencies. To address this issue, we present a novel deep learning-based method HiCMamba to enhance the resolution of Hi-C contact maps using a state space model. We adopt the UNet-based auto-encoder architecture to stack the proposed holistic scan block, enabling the perception of both global and local receptive fields at multiple scales. Experimental results demonstrate that HiCMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational resources. Furthermore, the 3D genome structures, including topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops, identified in the contact maps recovered by HiCMamba are validated through associated epigenomic features. Our work demonstrates the potential of a state space model as foundational frameworks in the field of Hi-C resolution enhancement.

- **Summary**: We propose a diffusion-based inverse rendering framework that decomposes a single RGB image into geometry, material, and lighting. Inverse rendering is inherently ill-posed, making it difficult to predict a single accurate solution. To address this challenge, recent generative model-based methods aim to present a range of possible solutions. However, finding a single accurate solution and generating diverse solutions can be conflicting. In this paper, we propose a channel-wise noise scheduling approach that allows a single diffusion model architecture to achieve two conflicting objectives. The resulting two diffusion models, trained with different channel-wise noise schedules, can predict a single highly accurate solution and present multiple possible solutions. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our two models in terms of both diversity and accuracy, which translates to enhanced performance in downstream applications such as object insertion and material editing.

- **Summary**: Video large language models have achieved remarkable performance in tasks such as video question answering, however, their temporal understanding remains suboptimal. To address this limitation, we curate a dedicated instruction fine-tuning dataset that focuses on enhancing temporal comprehension across five key dimensions. In order to reduce reliance on costly temporal annotations, we introduce a multi-task prompt fine-tuning approach that seamlessly integrates temporal-sensitive tasks into existing instruction datasets without requiring additional annotations. Furthermore, we develop a novel benchmark for temporal-sensitive video understanding that not only fills the gaps in dimension coverage left by existing benchmarks but also rigorously filters out potential shortcuts, ensuring a more accurate evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the temporal understanding of video-LLMs while avoiding reliance on shortcuts.

- **Summary**: This paper presents MetricGrids, a novel grid-based neural representation that combines elementary metric grids in various metric spaces to approximate complex nonlinear signals. While grid-based representations are widely adopted for their efficiency and scalability, the existing feature grids with linear indexing for continuous-space points can only provide degenerate linear latent space representations, and such representations cannot be adequately compensated to represent complex nonlinear signals by the following compact decoder. To address this problem while keeping the simplicity of a regular grid structure, our approach builds upon the standard grid-based paradigm by constructing multiple elementary metric grids as high-order terms to approximate complex nonlinearities, following the Taylor expansion principle. Furthermore, we enhance model compactness with hash encoding based on different sparsities of the grids to prevent detrimental hash collisions, and a high-order extrapolation decoder to reduce explicit grid storage requirements. experimental results on both 2D and 3D reconstructions demonstrate the superior fitting and rendering accuracy of the proposed method across diverse signal types, validating its robustness and generalizability.

- **Summary**: Dynamic imaging involves the reconstruction of a spatio-temporal object at all times using its undersampled measurements. In particular, in dynamic computed tomography (dCT), only a single projection at one view angle is available at a time, making the inverse problem very challenging. Moreover, ground-truth dynamic data is usually either unavailable or too scarce to be used for supervised learning techniques. To tackle this problem, we propose RSR-NF, which uses a neural field (NF) to represent the dynamic object and, using the Regularization-by-Denoising (RED) framework, incorporates an additional static deep spatial prior into a variational formulation via a learned restoration operator. We use an ADMM-based algorithm with variable splitting to efficiently optimize the variational objective. We compare RSR-NF to three alternatives: NF with only temporal regularization; a recent method combining a partially-separable low-rank representation with RED using a denoiser pretrained on static data; and a deep-image prior-based model. The first comparison demonstrates the reconstruction improvements achieved by combining the NF representation with static restoration priors, whereas the other two demonstrate the improvement over state-of-the art techniques for dCT.

- **Summary**: Image matching is a key component of modern 3D vision algorithms, essential for accurate scene reconstruction and localization. MASt3R redefines image matching as a 3D task by leveraging DUSt3R and introducing a fast reciprocal matching scheme that accelerates matching by orders of magnitude while preserving theoretical guarantees. This approach has gained strong traction, with DUSt3R and MASt3R collectively cited over 250 times in a short span, underscoring their impact. However, despite its accuracy, MASt3R's inference speed remains a bottleneck. On an A40 GPU, latency per image pair is 198.16 ms, mainly due to computational overhead from the ViT encoder-decoder and Fast Reciprocal Nearest Neighbor (FastNN) matching.   To address this, we introduce Speedy MASt3R, a post-training optimization framework that enhances inference efficiency while maintaining accuracy. It integrates multiple optimization techniques, including FlashMatch-an approach leveraging FlashAttention v2 with tiling strategies for improved efficiency, computation graph optimization via layer and tensor fusion having kernel auto-tuning with TensorRT (GraphFusion), and a streamlined FastNN pipeline that reduces memory access time from quadratic to linear while accelerating block-wise correlation scoring through vectorized computation (FastNN-Lite). Additionally, it employs mixed-precision inference with FP16/FP32 hybrid computations (HybridCast), achieving speedup while preserving numerical precision. Evaluated on Aachen Day-Night, InLoc, 7-Scenes, ScanNet1500, and MegaDepth1500, Speedy MASt3R achieves a 54% reduction in inference time (198 ms to 91 ms per image pair) without sacrificing accuracy. This advancement enables real-time 3D understanding, benefiting applications like mixed reality navigation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach for privacy-preserving collaborative learning. However, it faces significant challenges when dealing with domain shifts, especially when each client has access only to its source data and cannot share it during target domain adaptation. Moreover, FL methods often require high communication overhead due to multiple rounds of model updates between clients and the server. We propose a one-shot Federated Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (FUDA) method to address these limitations. Specifically, we introduce Scaled Entropy Attention (SEA) for model aggregation and Multi-Source Pseudo Labeling (MSPL) for target domain adaptation. SEA uses scaled prediction entropy on target domain to assign higher attention to reliable models. This improves the global model quality and ensures balanced weighting of contributions. MSPL distills knowledge from multiple source models to generate pseudo labels and manage noisy labels using smoothed soft-label cross-entropy (SSCE). Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four standard benchmarks while reducing communication and computation costs, making it highly suitable for real-world applications. The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.

- **Summary**: Rapid response to natural disasters such as earthquakes is a crucial element in ensuring the safety of civil infrastructures and minimizing casualties. Traditional manual inspection is labour-intensive, time-consuming, and can be dangerous for inspectors and rescue workers. This paper proposed an autonomous inspection approach for structural damage inspection and survivor detection in the post-disaster building indoor scenario, which incorporates an autonomous navigation method, deep learning-based damage and survivor detection method, and a customized low-cost micro aerial vehicle (MAV) with onboard sensors. Experimental studies in a pseudo-post-disaster office building have shown the proposed methodology can achieve high accuracy in structural damage inspection and survivor detection. Overall, the proposed inspection approach shows great potential to improve the efficiency of existing manual post-disaster building inspection.

- **Summary**: Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication holds significant promise for enhancing the perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles, allowing them to overcome occlusions and extend their field of view. However, existing research predominantly relies on simulated environments or static datasets, leaving the feasibility and effectiveness of V2X cooperative perception especially for intermediate fusion in real-world scenarios largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce V2X-ReaLO, an open online cooperative perception framework deployed on real vehicles and smart infrastructure that integrates early, late, and intermediate fusion methods within a unified pipeline and provides the first practical demonstration of online intermediate fusion's feasibility and performance under genuine real-world conditions. Additionally, we present an open benchmark dataset specifically designed to assess the performance of online cooperative perception systems. This new dataset extends V2X-Real dataset to dynamic, synchronized ROS bags and provides 25,028 test frames with 6,850 annotated key frames in challenging urban scenarios. By enabling real-time assessments of perception accuracy and communication lantency under dynamic conditions, V2X-ReaLO sets a new benchmark for advancing and optimizing cooperative perception systems in real-world applications. The codes and datasets will be released to further advance the field.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models consistently fail at generating counter-stereotypical action relationships (e.g., "mouse chasing cat"), defaulting to frequent stereotypes even when explicitly prompted otherwise. Through systematic investigation, we discover this limitation stems from distributional biases rather than inherent model constraints. Our key insight reveals that while models fail on rare compositions when their inversions are common, they can successfully generate similar intermediate compositions (e.g., "mouse chasing boy"). To test this hypothesis, we develop a Role-Bridging Decomposition framework that leverages these intermediates to gradually teach rare relationships without architectural modifications. We introduce ActionBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate action-based relationship generation across stereotypical and counter-stereotypical configurations. Our experiments validate that intermediate compositions indeed facilitate counter-stereotypical generation, with both automatic metrics and human evaluations showing significant improvements over existing approaches. This work not only identifies fundamental biases in current text-to-image systems but demonstrates a promising direction for addressing them through compositional reasoning.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancing of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in complex multimodal reasoning tasks in the real-world and virtual environment, which require coordinating multiple abilities, including visual perception, visual reasoning, spatial awareness, and target deduction. However, existing evaluations primarily assess the final task completion, often degrading assessments to isolated abilities such as visual grounding and visual question answering. Less attention is given to comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing reasoning process in multimodal environments, which is crucial for understanding model behaviors and underlying reasoning mechanisms beyond merely task success. To address this, we introduce MM-Escape, an extensible benchmark for investigating multimodal reasoning, inspired by real-world escape games. MM-Escape emphasizes intermediate model behaviors alongside final task completion. To achieve this, we develop EscapeCraft, a customizable and open environment that enables models to engage in free-form exploration for assessing multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments show that MLLMs, regardless of scale, can successfully complete the simplest room escape tasks, with some exhibiting human-like exploration strategies. Yet, performance dramatically drops as task difficulty increases. Moreover, we observe that performance bottlenecks vary across models, revealing distinct failure modes and limitations in their multimodal reasoning abilities, such as repetitive trajectories without adaptive exploration, getting stuck in corners due to poor visual spatial awareness, and ineffective use of acquired props, such as the key. We hope our work sheds light on new challenges in multimodal reasoning, and uncovers potential improvements in MLLMs capabilities.

- **Summary**: Image super-resolution (SR) aims to recover low-resolution images to high-resolution images, where improving SR efficiency is a high-profile challenge. However, commonly used units in SR, like convolutions and window-based Transformers, have limited receptive fields, making it challenging to apply them to improve SR under extremely limited computational cost. To address this issue, inspired by modeling convolution theorem through token mix, we propose a Fourier token-based plugin called FourierSR to improve SR uniformly, which avoids the instability or inefficiency of existing token mix technologies when applied as plug-ins. Furthermore, compared to convolutions and windows-based Transformers, our FourierSR only utilizes Fourier transform and multiplication operations, greatly reducing complexity while having global receptive fields. Experimental results show that our FourierSR as a plug-and-play unit brings an average PSNR gain of 0.34dB for existing efficient SR methods on Manga109 test set at the scale of x4, while the average increase in the number of Params and FLOPs is only 0.6% and 1.5% of original sizes. We will release our codes upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in pulmonary nodule detection significantly enhances the intelligence and real-time capabilities of the detection system. Currently, lung nodule detection primarily focuses on the identification of solid nodules, but different types of lung nodules correspond to various forms of lung cancer. Multi-type detection contributes to improving the overall lung cancer detection rate and enhancing the cure rate. To achieve high sensitivity in nodule detection, targeted improvements were made to the YOLOv8 model. Firstly, the C2f\_RepViTCAMF module was introduced to augment the C2f module in the backbone, thereby enhancing detection accuracy for small lung nodules and achieving a lightweight model design. Secondly, the MSCAF module was incorporated to reconstruct the feature fusion section of the model, improving detection accuracy for lung nodules of varying scales. Furthermore, the KAN network was integrated into the model. By leveraging the KAN network's powerful nonlinear feature learning capability, detection accuracy for small lung nodules was further improved, and the model's generalization ability was enhanced. Tests conducted on the LUNA16 dataset demonstrate that the improved model outperforms the original model as well as other mainstream models such as YOLOv9 and RT-DETR across various evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Lightweight image super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution images with limited computational costs. We find existing frequency-based SR methods cannot balance the reconstruction of overall structures and high-frequency parts. Meanwhile, these methods are inefficient for handling frequency features and unsuitable for lightweight SR. In this paper, we show introducing both wavelet and Fourier information allows our model to consider both high-frequency features and overall SR structure reconstruction while reducing costs. Specifically, we propose a dual-domain modulation network that utilize wavelet-domain modulation self-Transformer (WMT) plus Fourier supervision to modulate frequency features in addition to spatial domain modulation. Compared to existing frequency-based SR modules, our WMT is more suitable for frequency learning in lightweight SR. Experimental results show that our method achieves a comparable PSNR of SRFormer and MambaIR while with less than 50% and 60% of their FLOPs and achieving inference speeds 15.4x and 5.4x faster, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method on SR quality and lightweight. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown great potential in executing complex tasks, but coordination and safety remain significant challenges. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising framework for agent collaboration, but it faces difficulties in handling complex tasks and designing reward functions. The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought stronger reasoning and cognitive abilities to MAS, but existing LLM-based systems struggle to respond quickly and accurately in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-based Graph Collaboration MARL (LGC-MARL), a framework that efficiently combines LLMs and MARL. This framework decomposes complex tasks into executable subtasks and achieves efficient collaboration among multiple agents through graph-based coordination. Specifically, LGC-MARL consists of two main components: an LLM planner and a graph-based collaboration meta policy. The LLM planner transforms complex task instructions into a series of executable subtasks, evaluates the rationality of these subtasks using a critic model, and generates an action dependency graph. The graph-based collaboration meta policy facilitates communication and collaboration among agents based on the action dependency graph, and adapts to new task environments through meta-learning. Experimental results on the AI2-THOR simulation platform demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of LGC-MARL in completing various complex tasks.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) present a more energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by harnessing spatio-temporal dynamics and event-driven spikes. Effective utilization of temporal information is crucial for SNNs, leading to the exploration of attention mechanisms to enhance this capability. Conventional attention operations either apply identical operation or employ non-identical operations across target dimensions. We identify that these approaches provide distinct perspectives on temporal information. To leverage the strengths of both operations, we propose a novel Dual Temporal-channel-wise Attention (DTA) mechanism that integrates both identical/non-identical attention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to concentrate on both the correlation and dependency of temporal-channel using both identical and non-identical attention operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the DTA mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance on both static datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-1k) and dynamic dataset (CIFAR10-DVS), elevating spike representation and capturing complex temporal-channel relationship. We open-source our code: https://github.com/MnJnKIM/DTA-SNN.

- **Summary**: While 3D point clouds are widely utilized across various vision applications, their irregular and sparse nature make them challenging to handle. In response, numerous encoding approaches have been proposed to capture the rich semantic information of point clouds. Yet, a critical limitation persists: a lack of consideration for colored point clouds which are more capable 3D representations as they contain diverse attributes: color and geometry. While existing methods handle these attributes separately on a per-point basis, this leads to a limited receptive field and restricted ability to capture relationships across multiple points. To address this, we pioneer a point cloud encoding methodology that leverages 3D Fourier decomposition to disentangle color and geometric features while extending the receptive field through spectral-domain operations. Our analysis confirms that this encoding approach effectively separates feature components, where the amplitude uniquely captures color attributes and the phase encodes geometric structure, thereby enabling independent learning and utilization of both attributes. Furthermore, the spectral-domain properties of these components naturally aggregate local features while considering multiple points' information. We validate our point cloud encoding approach on point cloud classification and style transfer tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the DensePoint dataset with improvements via a proposed amplitude-based data augmentation strategy.

- **Summary**: Accurate survival prediction in oncology requires integrating diverse imaging modalities to capture the complex interplay of tumor biology. Traditional single-modality approaches often fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by radiological and pathological assessments. In this work, we introduce M4Survive (Multi-Modal Mamba Modeling for Survival Prediction), a novel framework that learns joint foundation model representations using efficient adapter networks. Our approach dynamically fuses heterogeneous embeddings from a foundation model repository (e.g., MedImageInsight, BiomedCLIP, Prov-GigaPath, UNI2-h), creating a correlated latent space optimized for survival risk estimation. By leveraging Mamba-based adapters, M4Survive enables efficient multi-modal learning while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms both unimodal and traditional static multi-modal baselines in survival prediction accuracy. This work underscores the potential of foundation model-driven multi-modal fusion in advancing precision oncology and predictive analytics.

- **Summary**: Neural architectures tend to fit their data with relatively simple functions. This "simplicity bias" is widely regarded as key to their success. This paper explores the limits of this principle. Building on recent findings that the simplicity bias stems from ReLU activations [96], we introduce a method to meta-learn new activation functions and inductive biases better suited to specific tasks.   Findings: We identify multiple tasks where the simplicity bias is inadequate and ReLUs suboptimal. In these cases, we learn new activation functions that perform better by inducing a prior of higher complexity. Interestingly, these cases correspond to domains where neural networks have historically struggled: tabular data, regression tasks, cases of shortcut learning, and algorithmic grokking tasks. In comparison, the simplicity bias induced by ReLUs proves adequate on image tasks where the best learned activations are nearly identical to ReLUs and GeLUs.   Implications: Contrary to popular belief, the simplicity bias of ReLU networks is not universally useful. It is near-optimal for image classification, but other inductive biases are sometimes preferable. We showed that activation functions can control these inductive biases, but future tailored architectures might provide further benefits. Advances are still needed to characterize a model's inductive biases beyond "complexity", and their adequacy with the data.

- **Summary**: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most common and aggressive types of pancreatic cancer. However, due to the lack of early and disease-specific symptoms, most patients with PDAC are diagnosed at an advanced disease stage. Consequently, early PDAC detection is crucial for improving patients' quality of life and expanding treatment options. In this work, we develop a coarse-to-fine approach to detect PDAC on contrast-enhanced CT scans. First, we localize and crop the region of interest from the low-resolution images, and then segment the PDAC-related structures at a finer scale. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further boost detection performance: (1) a data-splitting strategy for model ensembling, and (2) a customized post-processing function. We participated in the PANORAMA challenge and ranked 1st place for PDAC detection with an AUROC of 0.9263 and an AP of 0.7243.

- **Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in continuous environments requires agents to interpret natural language instructions while navigating unconstrained 3D spaces. Existing VLN-CE frameworks rely on a two-stage approach: a waypoint predictor to generate waypoints and a navigator to execute movements. However, current waypoint predictors struggle with spatial awareness, while navigators lack historical reasoning and backtracking capabilities, limiting adaptability. We propose a zero-shot VLN-CE framework integrating an enhanced waypoint predictor with a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based navigator. Our predictor employs a stronger vision encoder, masked cross-attention fusion, and an occupancy-aware loss for better waypoint quality. The navigator incorporates history-aware reasoning and adaptive path planning with backtracking, improving robustness. Experiments on R2R-CE and MP3D benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in zero-shot settings, demonstrating competitive results compared to fully supervised methods. Real-world validation on Turtlebot 4 further highlights its adaptability.

- **Summary**: Video generation has advanced rapidly, improving evaluation methods, yet assessing video's motion remains a major challenge. Specifically, there are two key issues: 1) current motion metrics do not fully align with human perceptions; 2) the existing motion prompts are limited. Based on these findings, we introduce VMBench--a comprehensive Video Motion Benchmark that has perception-aligned motion metrics and features the most diverse types of motion. VMBench has several appealing properties: 1) Perception-Driven Motion Evaluation Metrics, we identify five dimensions based on human perception in motion video assessment and develop fine-grained evaluation metrics, providing deeper insights into models' strengths and weaknesses in motion quality. 2) Meta-Guided Motion Prompt Generation, a structured method that extracts meta-information, generates diverse motion prompts with LLMs, and refines them through human-AI validation, resulting in a multi-level prompt library covering six key dynamic scene dimensions. 3) Human-Aligned Validation Mechanism, we provide human preference annotations to validate our benchmarks, with our metrics achieving an average 35.3% improvement in Spearman's correlation over baseline methods. This is the first time that the quality of motion in videos has been evaluated from the perspective of human perception alignment. Additionally, we will soon release VMBench at https://github.com/GD-AIGC/VMBench, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing motion generation models.

- **Summary**: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) based on human subjective preferences has undergone extensive research in the past decades. However, with the development of communication protocols, the visual data consumption volume of machines has gradually surpassed that of humans. For machines, the preference depends on downstream tasks such as segmentation and detection, rather than visual appeal. Considering the huge gap between human and machine visual systems, this paper proposes the topic: Image Quality Assessment for Machine Vision for the first time. Specifically, we (1) defined the subjective preferences of machines, including downstream tasks, test models, and evaluation metrics; (2) established the Machine Preference Database (MPD), which contains 2.25M fine-grained annotations and 30k reference/distorted image pair instances; (3) verified the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on MPD. Experiments show that current IQA metrics are human-centric and cannot accurately characterize machine preferences. We sincerely hope that MPD can promote the evolution of IQA from human to machine preferences. Project page is on: https://github.com/lcysyzxdxc/MPD.

- **Summary**: Recently, vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). By leveraging auxiliary data during training, these models can directly perform cross-category anomaly detection on target datasets, such as detecting defects on industrial product surfaces or identifying tumors in organ tissues. Existing approaches typically construct text prompts through either manual design or the optimization of learnable prompt vectors. However, these methods face several challenges: 1) handcrafted prompts require extensive expert knowledge and trial-and-error; 2) single-form learnable prompts struggle to capture complex anomaly semantics; and 3) an unconstrained prompt space limit generalization to unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose Bayesian Prompt Flow Learning (Bayes-PFL), which models the prompt space as a learnable probability distribution from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, a prompt flow module is designed to learn both image-specific and image-agnostic distributions, which are jointly utilized to regularize the text prompt space and enhance the model's generalization on unseen categories. These learned distributions are then sampled to generate diverse text prompts, effectively covering the prompt space. Additionally, a residual cross-attention (RCA) module is introduced to better align dynamic text embeddings with fine-grained image features. Extensive experiments on 15 industrial and medical datasets demonstrate our method's superior performance.

- **Summary**: The outstanding capability of diffusion models in generating high-quality images poses significant threats when misused by adversaries. In particular, we assume malicious adversaries exploiting diffusion models for inpainting tasks, such as replacing a specific region with a celebrity. While existing methods for protecting images from manipulation in diffusion-based generative models have primarily focused on image-to-image and text-to-image tasks, the challenge of preventing unauthorized inpainting has been rarely addressed, often resulting in suboptimal protection performance. To mitigate inpainting abuses, we propose ADVPAINT, a novel defensive framework that generates adversarial perturbations that effectively disrupt the adversary's inpainting tasks. ADVPAINT targets the self- and cross-attention blocks in a target diffusion inpainting model to distract semantic understanding and prompt interactions during image generation. ADVPAINT also employs a two-stage perturbation strategy, dividing the perturbation region based on an enlarged bounding box around the object, enhancing robustness across diverse masks of varying shapes and sizes. Our experimental results demonstrate that ADVPAINT's perturbations are highly effective in disrupting the adversary's inpainting tasks, outperforming existing methods; ADVPAINT attains over a 100-point increase in FID and substantial decreases in precision.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in portrait video generation have been noteworthy. However, existing methods rely heavily on human priors and pre-trained generation models, which may introduce unrealistic motion and lead to inefficient inference. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Latent Motion (SeMo), a compact and expressive motion representation. Leveraging this representation, our approach achieve both high-quality visual results and efficient inference. SeMo follows an effective three-step framework: Abstraction, Reasoning, and Generation. First, in the Abstraction step, we use a carefully designed Mask Motion Encoder to compress the subject's motion state into a compact and abstract latent motion (1D token). Second, in the Reasoning step, long-term modeling and efficient reasoning are performed in this latent space to generate motion sequences. Finally, in the Generation step, the motion dynamics serve as conditional information to guide the generation model in synthesizing realistic transitions from reference frames to target frames. Thanks to the compact and descriptive nature of Semantic Latent Motion, our method enables real-time video generation with highly realistic motion. User studies demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models with an 81% win rate in realism. Extensive experiments further highlight its strong compression capability, reconstruction quality, and generative potential. Moreover, its fully self-supervised nature suggests promising applications in broader video generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Background: Automated analysis of CT scans for abdominal organ measurement is crucial for improving diagnostic efficiency and reducing inter-observer variability. Manual segmentation and measurement of organs such as the kidneys, liver, spleen, and prostate are time-consuming and subject to inconsistency, underscoring the need for automated approaches.   Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop and validate an automated workflow for the segmentation and measurement of abdominal organs in CT scans using advanced deep learning models, in order to improve accuracy, reliability, and efficiency in clinical evaluations.   Methods: The proposed workflow combines nnU-Net, U-Net++ for organ segmentation, followed by a 3D RCNN model for measuring organ volumes and dimensions. The models were trained and evaluated on CT datasets with metrics such as precision, recall, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess performance. Segmentation quality was verified for its adaptability to variations in patient anatomy and scanner settings.   Results: The developed workflow achieved high precision and recall values, exceeding 95 for all targeted organs. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) values were low, indicating a high level of consistency between predicted and ground truth measurements. The segmentation and measurement pipeline demonstrated robust performance, providing accurate delineation and quantification of the kidneys, liver, spleen, and prostate.   Conclusion: The proposed approach offers an automated, efficient, and reliable solution for abdominal organ measurement in CT scans. By significantly reducing manual intervention, this workflow enhances measurement accuracy and consistency, with potential for widespread clinical implementation. Future work will focus on expanding the approach to other organs and addressing complex pathological cases.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a non-invasive approach to estimate the layer thicknesses of perovskite solar cells. The thicknesses are predicted by a convolutional neural network that leverages the external quantum efficiency of a perovskite solar cell. The network is trained in thickness ranges where the optical properties are constant, and these ranges set the constraints for the network's application. Due to light sensitivity issues with opaque perovskites, the convolutional neural network showed better performance with transparent perovskites. To optimize the performance and reduce the root mean square error, we tried different sampling methods, image specifications, and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. While sampling methods showed marginal improvement, implementing Bayesian optimization demonstrated high accuracy. Other minor optimization attempts include experimenting with input specifications and pre-processing approaches. The results confirm the feasibility, efficiency, and effectiveness of a convolution neural network for predicting perovskite solar cells' layer thicknesses based on controlled experiments.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in modeling complex data priors, catalyzing their widespread adoption in solving various inverse problems. However, the inherently iterative nature of diffusion-based inverse algorithms often requires hundreds to thousands of steps, with performance degradation occurring under fewer steps which limits their practical applicability. While high-order diffusion ODE solvers have been extensively explored for efficient diffusion sampling without observations, their application to inverse problems remains underexplored due to the diverse forms of inverse algorithms and their need for repeated trajectory correction based on observations. To address this gap, we first introduce a canonical form that decomposes existing diffusion-based inverse algorithms into three modules to unify their analysis. Inspired by the linear subspace search strategy in the design of high-order diffusion ODE solvers, we propose the Learnable Linear Extrapolation (LLE) method, a lightweight approach that universally enhances the performance of any diffusion-based inverse algorithm that fits the proposed canonical form. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements of the proposed LLE method across multiple algorithms and tasks, indicating its potential for more efficient solutions and boosted performance of diffusion-based inverse algorithms with limited steps. Codes for reproducing our experiments are available at https://github.com/weigerzan/LLE_inverse_problem.

- **Summary**: Continuous Emotion Recognition (CER) plays a crucial role in intelligent human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and autonomous driving. Emotion modeling based on the Valence-Arousal (VA) space enables a more nuanced representation of emotional states. However, existing methods still face challenges in handling long-term dependencies and capturing complex temporal dynamics. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel emotion recognition model, Mamba-VA, which leverages the Mamba architecture to efficiently model sequential emotional variations in video frames. First, the model employs a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to extract deep visual features from video frames, enhancing the robustness of temporal information. Then, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is utilized for temporal modeling to capture local temporal dependencies. Subsequently, Mamba is applied for long-sequence modeling, enabling the learning of global emotional trends. Finally, a fully connected (FC) layer performs regression analysis to predict continuous valence and arousal values. Experimental results on the Valence-Arousal (VA) Estimation task of the 8th competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) demonstrate that the proposed model achieves valence and arousal scores of 0.5362 (0.5036) and 0.4310 (0.4119) on the validation (test) set, respectively, outperforming the baseline.

- **Summary**: Image fusion aims to integrate comprehensive information from images acquired through multiple sources. However, images captured by diverse sensors often encounter various degradations that can negatively affect fusion quality. Traditional fusion methods generally treat image enhancement and fusion as separate processes, overlooking the inherent correlation between them; notably, the dominant regions in one modality of a fused image often indicate areas where the other modality might benefit from enhancement. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the concept of dominant regions for image enhancement and present a Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent framework for Image Fusion (Dream-IF). This framework quantifies the relative dominance of each modality across different layers and leverages this information to facilitate reciprocal cross-modal enhancement. By integrating the relative dominance derived from image fusion, our approach supports not only image restoration but also a broader range of image enhancement applications. Furthermore, we employ prompt-based encoding to capture degradation-specific details, which dynamically steer the restoration process and promote coordinated enhancement in both multi-modal image fusion and image enhancement scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Dream-IF consistently outperforms its counterparts.

- **Summary**: Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) aims to match videos with corresponding textual queries, yet the continual influx of new video content poses a significant challenge for maintaining system performance over time. In this work, we introduce the first benchmark for Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) to overcome these limitations. Our analysis reveals that current TVR methods based on pre-trained models struggle to retain plasticity when adapting to new tasks, while existing continual learning approaches experience catastrophic forgetting, resulting in semantic misalignment between historical queries and stored video features. To address these challenges, we propose StableFusion, a novel CTVR framework comprising two main components: the Frame Fusion Adapter (FFA), which captures temporal dynamics in video content while preserving model flexibility, and the Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (TAME), which maintains consistent semantic alignment between queries across tasks and the stored video features. Comprehensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets under various task settings demonstrate that StableFusion outperforms existing continual learning and TVR methods, achieving superior retrieval performance with minimal degradation on earlier tasks in the context of continuous video streams.

- **Summary**: Multi-object images are prevalent in various real-world scenarios, including augmented reality, advertisement design, and medical imaging. Efficient and precise editing of these images is critical for these applications. With the advent of Stable Diffusion (SD), high-quality image generation and editing have entered a new era. However, existing methods often struggle to consider each object both individually and part of the whole image editing, both of which are crucial for ensuring consistent quantity perception, resulting in suboptimal perceptual performance. To address these challenges, we propose MoEdit, an auxiliary-free multi-object image editing framework. MoEdit facilitates high-quality multi-object image editing in terms of style transfer, object reinvention, and background regeneration, while ensuring consistent quantity perception between inputs and outputs, even with a large number of objects. To achieve this, we introduce the Feature Compensation (FeCom) module, which ensures the distinction and separability of each object attribute by minimizing the in-between interlacing. Additionally, we present the Quantity Attention (QTTN) module, which perceives and preserves quantity consistency by effective control in editing, without relying on auxiliary tools. By leveraging the SD model, MoEdit enables customized preservation and modification of specific concepts in inputs with high quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our MoEdit achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance in multi-object image editing.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of generative AI, AI-generated images have become increasingly realistic, raising concerns about creativity, misinformation, and content authenticity. Detecting such images and identifying their source models has become a critical challenge in ensuring the integrity of digital media. This paper tackles the detection of AI-generated images and identifying their source models using CNN and CLIP-ViT classifiers. For the CNN-based classifier, we leverage EfficientNet-B0 as the backbone and feed with RGB channels, frequency features, and reconstruction errors, while for CLIP-ViT, we adopt a pretrained CLIP image encoder to extract image features and SVM to perform classification. Evaluated on the Defactify 4 dataset, our methods demonstrate strong performance in both tasks, with CLIP-ViT showing superior robustness to image perturbations. Compared to baselines like AEROBLADE and OCC-CLIP, our approach achieves competitive results. Notably, our method ranked Top-3 overall in the Defactify 4 competition, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability.

- **Summary**: Existing Image Restoration (IR) studies typically focus on task-specific or universal modes individually, relying on the mode selection of users and lacking the cooperation between multiple task-specific/universal restoration modes. This leads to insufficient interaction for unprofessional users and limits their restoration capability for complicated real-world applications. In this work, we present HybridAgent, intending to incorporate multiple restoration modes into a unified image restoration model and achieve intelligent and efficient user interaction through our proposed hybrid agents. Concretely, we propose the hybrid rule of fast, slow, and feedback restoration agents. Here, the slow restoration agent optimizes the powerful multimodal large language model (MLLM) with our proposed instruction-tuning dataset to identify degradations within images with ambiguous user prompts and invokes proper restoration tools accordingly. The fast restoration agent is designed based on a lightweight large language model (LLM) via in-context learning to understand the user prompts with simple and clear requirements, which can obviate the unnecessary time/resource costs of MLLM. Moreover, we introduce the mixed distortion removal mode for our HybridAgents, which is crucial but not concerned in previous agent-based works. It can effectively prevent the error propagation of step-by-step image restoration and largely improve the efficiency of the agent system. We validate the effectiveness of HybridAgent with both synthetic and real-world IR tasks.

- **Summary**: Multimodal autoregressive (AR) models, based on next-token prediction and transformer architecture, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various multimodal tasks including text-to-image (T2I) generation. Despite their strong performance in general T2I tasks, our research reveals that these models initially struggle with subject-driven image generation compared to dominant diffusion models. To address this limitation, we introduce Proxy-Tuning, leveraging diffusion models to enhance AR models' capabilities in subject-specific image generation. Our method reveals a striking weak-to-strong phenomenon: fine-tuned AR models consistently outperform their diffusion model supervisors in both subject fidelity and prompt adherence. We analyze this performance shift and identify scenarios where AR models excel, particularly in multi-subject compositions and contextual understanding. This work not only demonstrates impressive results in subject-driven AR image generation, but also unveils the potential of weak-to-strong generalization in the image generation domain, contributing to a deeper understanding of different architectures' strengths and limitations.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a unified layout planning and image generation model, PlanGen, which can pre-plan spatial layout conditions before generating images. Unlike previous diffusion-based models that treat layout planning and layout-to-image as two separate models, PlanGen jointly models the two tasks into one autoregressive transformer using only next-token prediction. PlanGen integrates layout conditions into the model as context without requiring specialized encoding of local captions and bounding box coordinates, which provides significant advantages over the previous embed-and-pool operations on layout conditions, particularly when dealing with complex layouts. Unified prompting allows PlanGen to perform multitasking training related to layout, including layout planning, layout-to-image generation, image layout understanding, etc. In addition, PlanGen can be seamlessly expanded to layout-guided image manipulation thanks to the well-designed modeling, with teacher-forcing content manipulation policy and negative layout guidance. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our PlanGen in multiple layoutrelated tasks, showing its great potential. Code is available at: https://360cvgroup.github.io/PlanGen.

- **Summary**: Estimation of a single leaf area can be a measure of crop growth and a phenotypic trait to breed new varieties. It has also been used to measure leaf area index and total leaf area. Some studies have used hand-held cameras, image processing 3D reconstruction and unsupervised learning-based methods to estimate the leaf area in plant images. Deep learning works well for object detection and segmentation tasks; however, direct area estimation of objects has not been explored. This work investigates deep learning-based leaf area estimation, for RGBD images taken using a mobile camera setup in real-world scenarios. A dataset for attached leaves captured with a top angle view and a dataset for detached single leaves were collected for model development and testing. First, image processing-based area estimation was tested on manually segmented leaves. Then a Mask R-CNN-based model was investigated, and modified to accept RGBD images and to estimate the leaf area. The detached-leaf data set was then mixed with the attached-leaf plant data set to estimate the single leaf area for plant images, and another network design with two backbones was proposed: one for segmentation and the other for area estimation. Instead of trying all possibilities or random values, an agile approach was used in hyperparameter tuning. The final model was cross-validated with 5-folds and tested with two unseen datasets: detached and attached leaves. The F1 score with 90% IoA for segmentation result on unseen detached-leaf data was 1.0, while R-squared of area estimation was 0.81. For unseen plant data segmentation, the F1 score with 90% IoA was 0.59, while the R-squared score was 0.57. The research suggests using attached leaves with ground truth area to improve the results.

- **Summary**: Video-to-audio synthesis, which generates synchronized audio for visual content, critically enhances viewer immersion and narrative coherence in film and interactive media. However, video-to-audio dubbing for long-form content remains an unsolved challenge due to dynamic semantic shifts, temporal misalignment, and the absence of dedicated datasets. While existing methods excel in short videos, they falter in long scenarios (e.g., movies) due to fragmented synthesis and inadequate cross-scene consistency. We propose LVAS-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that emulates professional dubbing workflows through collaborative role specialization. Our approach decomposes long-video synthesis into four steps including scene segmentation, script generation, sound design and audio synthesis. Central innovations include a discussion-correction mechanism for scene/script refinement and a generation-retrieval loop for temporal-semantic alignment. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce LVAS-Bench, the first benchmark with 207 professionally curated long videos spanning diverse scenarios. Experiments demonstrate superior audio-visual alignment over baseline methods. Project page: https://lvas-agent.github.io

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: High dynamic range (HDR) novel view synthesis (NVS) aims to reconstruct HDR scenes by leveraging multi-view low dynamic range (LDR) images captured at different exposure levels. Current training paradigms with 3D tone mapping often result in unstable HDR reconstruction, while training with 2D tone mapping reduces the model's capacity to fit LDR images. Additionally, the global tone mapper used in existing methods can impede the learning of both HDR and LDR representations. To address these challenges, we present GaussHDR, which unifies 3D and 2D local tone mapping through 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we design a residual local tone mapper for both 3D and 2D tone mapping that accepts an additional context feature as input. We then propose combining the dual LDR rendering results from both 3D and 2D local tone mapping at the loss level. Finally, recognizing that different scenes may exhibit varying balances between the dual results, we introduce uncertainty learning and use the uncertainties for adaptive modulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussHDR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provides a new framework for novel view synthesis, and has spiked a new wave of research in neural rendering and related applications. As 3DGS is becoming a foundational component of many models, any improvement on 3DGS itself can bring huge benefits. To this end, we aim to improve the fundamental paradigm and formulation of 3DGS. We argue that as an unnormalized mixture model, it needs to be neither Gaussians nor splatting. We subsequently propose a new mixture model consisting of flexible Student's t distributions, with both positive (splatting) and negative (scooping) densities. We name our model Student Splatting and Scooping, or SSS. When providing better expressivity, SSS also poses new challenges in learning. Therefore, we also propose a new principled sampling approach for optimization. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, across multiple datasets, settings, and metrics, we demonstrate that SSS outperforms existing methods in terms of quality and parameter efficiency, e.g. achieving matching or better quality with similar numbers of components, and obtaining comparable results while reducing the component number by as much as 82%.

- **Summary**: In real-world environments, a LiDAR point cloud registration method with robust generalization capabilities (across varying distances and datasets) is crucial for ensuring safety in autonomous driving and other LiDAR-based applications. However, current methods fall short in achieving this level of generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UGP, a pruned framework designed to enhance generalization power for LiDAR point cloud registration. The core insight in UGP is the elimination of cross-attention mechanisms to improve generalization, allowing the network to concentrate on intra-frame feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a progressive self-attention module to reduce ambiguity in large-scale scenes and integrate Bird's Eye View (BEV) features to incorporate semantic information about scene elements. Together, these enhancements significantly boost the network's generalization performance. We validated our approach through various generalization experiments in multiple outdoor scenes. In cross-distance generalization experiments on KITTI and nuScenes, UGP achieved state-of-the-art mean Registration Recall rates of 94.5% and 91.4%, respectively. In cross-dataset generalization from nuScenes to KITTI, UGP achieved a state-of-the-art mean Registration Recall of 90.9%. Code will be available at https://github.com/peakpang/UGP.



### A Hierarchical Semantic Distillation Framework for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) aims to detect objects beyond the training annotations, where detectors are usually aligned to a pre-trained vision-language model, eg, CLIP, to inherit its generalizable recognition ability so that detectors can recognize new or novel objects. However, previous works directly align the feature space with CLIP and fail to learn the semantic knowledge effectively. In this work, we propose a hierarchical semantic distillation framework named HD-OVD to construct a comprehensive distillation process, which exploits generalizable knowledge from the CLIP model in three aspects. In the first hierarchy of HD-OVD, the detector learns fine-grained instance-wise semantics from the CLIP image encoder by modeling relations among single objects in the visual space. Besides, we introduce text space novel-class-aware classification to help the detector assimilate the highly generalizable class-wise semantics from the CLIP text encoder, representing the second hierarchy. Lastly, abundant image-wise semantics containing multi-object and their contexts are also distilled by an image-wise contrastive distillation. Benefiting from the elaborated semantic distillation in triple hierarchies, our HD-OVD inherits generalizable recognition ability from CLIP in instance, class, and image levels. Thus, we boost the novel AP on the OV-COCO dataset to 46.4% with a ResNet50 backbone, which outperforms others by a clear margin. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to analyze how each component works.

- **Summary**: Quality control (QC) has long been considered essential to guarantee the reliability of neuroimaging studies. It is particularly important for fetal brain MRI, where acquisitions and image processing techniques are less standardized than in adult imaging. In this work, we focus on automated quality control of super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) volumes of fetal brain MRI, an important processing step where multiple stacks of thick 2D slices are registered together and combined to build a single, isotropic and artifact-free T2 weighted volume. We propose FetMRQC$_{SR}$, a machine-learning method that extracts more than 100 image quality metrics to predict image quality scores using a random forest model. This approach is well suited to a problem that is high dimensional, with highly heterogeneous data and small datasets. We validate FetMRQC$_{SR}$ in an out-of-domain (OOD) setting and report high performance (ROC AUC = 0.89), even when faced with data from an unknown site or SRR method. We also investigate failure cases and show that they occur in $45\%$ of the images due to ambiguous configurations for which the rating from the expert is arguable. These results are encouraging and illustrate how a non deep learning-based method like FetMRQC$_{SR}$ is well suited to this multifaceted problem. Our tool, along with all the code used to generate, train and evaluate the model will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

- **Summary**: Digital twins are fundamental to the development of autonomous driving and embodied artificial intelligence. However, achieving high-granularity surface reconstruction and high-fidelity rendering remains a challenge. Gaussian splatting offers efficient photorealistic rendering but struggles with geometric inconsistencies due to fragmented primitives and sparse observational data in robotics applications. Existing regularization methods, which rely on render-derived constraints, often fail in complex environments. Moreover, effectively integrating sparse LiDAR data with Gaussian splatting remains challenging. We propose a unified LiDAR-visual system that synergizes Gaussian splatting with a neural signed distance field. The accurate LiDAR point clouds enable a trained neural signed distance field to offer a manifold geometry field, This motivates us to offer an SDF-based Gaussian initialization for physically grounded primitive placement and a comprehensive geometric regularization for geometrically consistent rendering and reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate superior reconstruction accuracy and rendering quality across diverse trajectories. To benefit the community, the codes will be released at https://github.com/hku-mars/GS-SDF.

- **Summary**: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucination, where the generated responses contain inaccuracies that are not grounded in the visual input. Efforts to address this issue without model finetuning primarily mitigate hallucination by reducing biases contrastively or amplifying the weights of visual embedding during decoding. However, these approaches improve visual perception at the cost of impairing the language reasoning capability. In this work, we propose the Perception Magnifier (PM), a novel visual decoding method that iteratively isolates relevant visual tokens based on attention and magnifies the corresponding regions, spurring the model to concentrate on fine-grained visual details during decoding. Specifically, by magnifying critical regions while preserving the structural and contextual information at each decoding step, PM allows the VLM to enhance its scrutiny of the visual input, hence producing more accurate and faithful responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PM not only achieves superior hallucination mitigation but also enhances language generation while preserving strong reasoning capabilities.

- **Summary**: Recently, large pre-trained foundation models have become widely adopted by machine learning practitioners for a multitude of tasks. Given that such models are publicly available, relying on their use as backbone models for downstream tasks might result in high vulnerability to adversarial attacks crafted with the same public model. In this work, we propose Robustness Tokens, a novel approach specific to the transformer architecture that fine-tunes a few additional private tokens with low computational requirements instead of tuning model parameters as done in traditional adversarial training. We show that Robustness Tokens make Vision Transformer models significantly more robust to white-box adversarial attacks while also retaining the original downstream performances.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising tool for event-based optical flow estimation tasks due to their ability to leverage spatio-temporal information and low-power capabilities. However, the performance of SNN models is often constrained, limiting their application in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel neural network architecture, ST-FlowNet, specifically tailored for optical flow estimation from event-based data. The ST-FlowNet architecture integrates ConvGRU modules to facilitate cross-modal feature augmentation and temporal alignment of the predicted optical flow, improving the network's ability to capture complex motion dynamics. Additionally, to overcome the challenges associated with training SNNs, we introduce a novel approach to derive SNN models from pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) through ANN-to-SNN conversion or our proposed BISNN method. Notably, the BISNN method alleviates the complexities involved in biological parameter selection, further enhancing the robustness of SNNs in optical flow estimation tasks. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark event-based datasets demonstrate that the SNN-based ST-FlowNet model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior performance in accurate optical flow estimation across a diverse range of dynamic visual scenes. Furthermore, the inherent energy efficiency of SNN models is highlighted, establishing a compelling advantage for their practical deployment. Overall, our work presents a novel framework for optical flow estimation using SNNs and event-based data, contributing to the advancement of neuromorphic vision applications.

- **Summary**: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant challenges in modeling the temporal context within long videos. Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools (e.g., search engine, memory banks, OCR, retrieval models) to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our methodology consists of four key steps: 1. Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2. Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos, improving the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3. Action: Agents answer long video-related questions and exchange reasons. 4. Reflection: We evaluate the performance of each agent in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (including GPT-4o) and open-source models (including InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, on the LongVideoBench dataset, LVAgent improves accuracy by up to 14.3% compared with SOTA.

- **Summary**: Scene flow provides crucial motion information for autonomous driving. Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel $\textbf{T}$raffic-$\textbf{A}$ware $\textbf{R}$adar $\textbf{S}$cene flow estimation method, named $\textbf{TARS}$, which utilizes the motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. Therefrom, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space, enabling a holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.

- **Summary**: Analyzing animal behavior is crucial in advancing neuroscience, yet quantifying and deciphering its intricate dynamics remains a significant challenge. Traditional machine vision approaches, despite their ability to detect spontaneous behaviors, fall short due to limited interpretability and reliance on manual labeling, which restricts the exploration of the full behavioral spectrum. Here, we introduce MouseGPT, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that integrates visual cues with natural language to revolutionize mouse behavior analysis. Built upon our first-of-its-kind dataset - incorporating pose dynamics and open-vocabulary behavioral annotations across over 42 million frames of diverse psychiatric conditions - MouseGPT provides a novel, context-rich method for comprehensive behavior interpretation. Our holistic analysis framework enables detailed behavior profiling, clustering, and novel behavior discovery, offering deep insights without the need for labor - intensive manual annotation. Evaluations reveal that MouseGPT surpasses existing models in precision, adaptability, and descriptive richness, positioning it as a transformative tool for ethology and for unraveling complex behavioral dynamics in animal models.

- **Summary**: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to prevent catastrophic forgetting of previously learned classes while sequentially incorporating new ones. The more challenging Few-shot CIL (FSCIL) setting further complicates this by providing only a limited number of samples for each new class, increasing the risk of overfitting in addition to standard CIL challenges. While catastrophic forgetting has been extensively studied, overfitting in FSCIL, especially with large foundation models, has received less attention. To fill this gap, we propose the Singular Value Fine-tuning for FSCIL (SVFCL) and compared it with existing approaches for adapting foundation models to FSCIL, which primarily build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like prompt tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Specifically, SVFCL applies singular value decomposition to the foundation model weights, keeping the singular vectors fixed while fine-tuning the singular values for each task, and then merging them. This simple yet effective approach not only alleviates the forgetting problem but also mitigates overfitting more effectively while significantly reducing trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, along with visualizations and ablation studies, validate the effectiveness of SVFCL. The code will be made available.

- **Summary**: Anticipating and recognizing surgical workflows are critical for intelligent surgical assistance systems. However, existing methods rely on deterministic decision-making, struggling to generalize across the large anatomical and procedural variations inherent in real-world surgeries.In this paper, we introduce an innovative framework that incorporates stochastic modeling through a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) into conventional deterministic learning for surgical workflow analysis. At the heart of our approach is a collaborative co-training paradigm: the DDPM branch captures procedural uncertainties to enrich feature representations, while the task branch focuses on predicting surgical phases and instrument usage.Theoretically, we demonstrate that this mutual refinement mechanism benefits both branches: the DDPM reduces prediction errors in uncertain scenarios, and the task branch directs the DDPM toward clinically meaningful representations. Notably, the DDPM branch is discarded during inference, enabling real-time predictions without sacrificing accuracy.Experiments on the Cholec80 dataset show that for the anticipation task, our method achieves a 16% reduction in eMAE compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and for phase recognition, it improves the Jaccard score by 1.0%. Additionally, on the AutoLaparo dataset, our method achieves a 1.5% improvement in the Jaccard score for phase recognition, while also exhibiting robust generalization to patient-specific variations.

- **Summary**: Amodal segmentation aims to infer the complete shape of occluded objects, even when the occluded region's appearance is unavailable. However, current amodal segmentation methods lack the capability to interact with users through text input and struggle to understand or reason about implicit and complex purposes. While methods like LISA integrate multi-modal large language models (LLMs) with segmentation for reasoning tasks, they are limited to predicting only visible object regions and face challenges in handling complex occlusion scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task named amodal reasoning segmentation, aiming to predict the complete amodal shape of occluded objects while providing answers with elaborations based on user text input. We develop a generalizable dataset generation pipeline and introduce a new dataset focusing on daily life scenarios, encompassing diverse real-world occlusions. Furthermore, we present AURA (Amodal Understanding and Reasoning Assistant), a novel model with advanced global and spatial-level designs specifically tailored to handle complex occlusions. Extensive experiments validate AURA's effectiveness on the proposed dataset. The code, model, and dataset will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Classifying images with an interpretable decision-making process is a long-standing problem in computer vision. In recent years, Prototypical Part Networks has gained traction as an approach for self-explainable neural networks, due to their ability to mimic human visual reasoning by providing explanations based on prototypical object parts. However, the quality of the explanations generated by these methods leaves room for improvement, as the prototypes usually focus on repetitive and redundant concepts. Leveraging recent advances in prototype learning, we present a framework for part-based interpretable image classification that learns a set of semantically distinctive object parts for each class, and provides diverse and comprehensive explanations. The core of our method is to learn the part-prototypes in a non-parametric fashion, through clustering deep features extracted from foundation vision models that encode robust semantic information. To quantitatively evaluate the quality of explanations provided by ProtoPNets, we introduce Distinctiveness Score and Comprehensiveness Score. Through evaluation on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and Stanford Dogs datasets, we show that our framework compares favourably against existing ProtoPNets while achieving better interpretability.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes without labeled training examples by leveraging class-level semantic descriptors such as attributes. A fundamental challenge in ZSL is semantic misalignment, where semantic-unrelated information involved in visual features introduce ambiguity to visual-semantic interaction. Unlike existing methods that suppress semantic-unrelated information post hoc either in the feature space or the model space, we propose addressing this issue at the input stage, preventing semantic-unrelated patches from propagating through the network. To this end, we introduce Semantically contextualized VIsual Patches (SVIP) for ZSL, a transformer-based framework designed to enhance visual-semantic alignment. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised patch selection mechanism that preemptively learns to identify semantic-unrelated patches in the input space. This is trained with the supervision from aggregated attention scores across all transformer layers, which estimate each patch's semantic score. As removing semantic-unrelated patches from the input sequence may disrupt object structure, we replace them with learnable patch embeddings. With initialization from word embeddings, we can ensure they remain semantically meaningful throughout feature extraction. Extensive experiments on ZSL benchmarks demonstrate that SVIP achieves state-of-the-art performance results while providing more interpretable and semantically rich feature representations.

- **Summary**: While the quality of novel-view images has improved dramatically with 3D Gaussian Splatting, extracting specific objects from scenes remains challenging. Isolating individual 3D Gaussian primitives for each object and handling occlusions in scenes remain far from being solved. We propose a novel object extraction method based on two key principles: (1) being object-centric by pruning irrelevant primitives; and (2) leveraging generative inpainting to compensate for missing observations caused by occlusions. For pruning, we analyze the local structure of primitives using K-nearest neighbors, and retain only relevant ones. For inpainting, we employ an off-the-shelf diffusion-based inpainter combined with occlusion reasoning, utilizing the 3D representation of the entire scene. Our findings highlight the crucial synergy between pruning and inpainting, both of which significantly enhance extraction performance. We evaluate our method on a standard real-world dataset and introduce a synthetic dataset for quantitative analysis. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, demonstrating its effectiveness in object extraction from complex scenes.

- **Summary**: Video Quality Assessment (VQA), which intends to predict the perceptual quality of videos, has attracted increasing attention. Due to factors like motion blur or specific distortions, the quality of different regions in a video varies. Recognizing the region-wise local quality within a video is beneficial for assessing global quality and can guide us in adopting fine-grained enhancement or transcoding strategies. Due to the heavy cost of annotating region-wise quality, the lack of ground truth constraints from relevant datasets further complicates the utilization of local perception. Inspired by the Human Visual System (HVS) that links global quality to the local texture of different regions and their visual saliency, we propose a Kaleidoscope Video Quality Assessment (KVQ) framework, which aims to effectively assess both saliency and local texture, thereby facilitating the assessment of global quality. Our framework extracts visual saliency and allocates attention using Fusion-Window Attention (FWA) while incorporating a Local Perception Constraint (LPC) to mitigate the reliance of regional texture perception on neighboring areas. KVQ obtains significant improvements across multiple scenarios on five VQA benchmarks compared to SOTA methods. Furthermore, to assess local perception, we establish a new Local Perception Visual Quality (LPVQ) dataset with region-wise annotations. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of KVQ in perceiving local distortions. KVQ models and the LPVQ dataset will be available at https://github.com/qyp2000/KVQ.

- **Summary**: Our study focuses on isolating swallowing dynamics from interfering patient motion in videofluoroscopy, an X-ray technique that records patients swallowing a radiopaque bolus. These recordings capture multiple motion sources, including head movement, anatomical displacements, and bolus transit. To enable precise analysis of swallowing physiology, we aim to eliminate distracting motion, particularly head movement, while preserving essential swallowing-related dynamics. Optical flow methods fail due to artifacts like flickering and instability, making them unreliable for distinguishing different motion groups. We evaluated markerless tracking approaches (CoTracker, PIPs++, TAP-Net) and quantified tracking accuracy in key medical regions of interest. Our findings show that even sparse tracking points generate morphing displacement fields that outperform leading registration methods such as ANTs, LDDMM, and VoxelMorph. To compare all approaches, we assessed performance using MSE and SSIM metrics post-registration. We introduce a novel motion correction pipeline that effectively removes disruptive motion while preserving swallowing dynamics and surpassing competitive registration techniques. Code will be available after review.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients) without sharing the local data of the clients. Most of the existing FL methods assume that the data distributed across all clients is associated with the same data modality. However, remote sensing (RS) images present in different clients can be associated with diverse data modalities. The joint use of the multi-modal RS data can significantly enhance classification performance. To effectively exploit decentralized and unshared multi-modal RS data, our paper introduces a novel multi-modal FL framework for RS image classification problems. The proposed framework comprises three modules: 1) multi-modal fusion (MF); 2) feature whitening (FW); and 3) mutual information maximization (MIM). The MF module employs iterative model averaging to facilitate learning without accessing multi-modal training data on clients. The FW module aims to address the limitations of training data heterogeneity by aligning data distributions across clients. The MIM module aims to model mutual information by maximizing the similarity between images from different modalities. For the experimental analyses, we focus our attention on multi-label classification and pixel-based classification tasks in RS. The results obtained using two benchmark archives show the effectiveness of the proposed framework when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. The code of the proposed framework will be available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/multi-modal-FL.

- **Summary**: Inversion-based image editing is rapidly gaining momentum while suffering from significant computation overhead, hindering its application in real-time interactive scenarios. In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

- **Summary**: We present VicaSplat, a novel framework for joint 3D Gaussians reconstruction and camera pose estimation from a sequence of unposed video frames, which is a critical yet underexplored task in real-world 3D applications. The core of our method lies in a novel transformer-based network architecture. In particular, our model starts with an image encoder that maps each image to a list of visual tokens. All visual tokens are concatenated with additional inserted learnable camera tokens. The obtained tokens then fully communicate with each other within a tailored transformer decoder. The camera tokens causally aggregate features from visual tokens of different views, and further modulate them frame-wisely to inject view-dependent features. 3D Gaussian splats and camera pose parameters can then be estimated via different prediction heads. Experiments show that VicaSplat surpasses baseline methods for multi-view inputs, and achieves comparable performance to prior two-view approaches. Remarkably, VicaSplat also demonstrates exceptional cross-dataset generalization capability on the ScanNet benchmark, achieving superior performance without any fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: Propelled by the breakthrough in deep generative models, audio-to-image generation has emerged as a pivotal cross-model task that converts complex auditory signals into rich visual representations. However, previous works only focus on single-source audio inputs for image generation, ignoring the multi-source characteristic in natural auditory scenes, thus limiting the performance in generating comprehensive visual content. To bridge this gap, a method called MACS is proposed to conduct multi-source audio-to-image generation. This is the first work that explicitly separates multi-source audio to capture the rich audio components before image generation. MACS is a two-stage method. In the first stage, multi-source audio inputs are separated by a weakly supervised method, where the audio and text labels are semantically aligned by casting into a common space using the large pre-trained CLAP model. We introduce a ranking loss to consider the contextual significance of the separated audio signals. In the second stage, efficient image generation is achieved by mapping the separated audio signals to the generation condition using only a trainable adapter and a MLP layer. We preprocess the LLP dataset as the first full multi-source audio-to-image generation benchmark. The experiments are conducted on multi-source, mixed-source, and single-source audio-to-image generation tasks. The proposed MACS outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in 17 of the 21 evaluation indexes on all tasks and delivers superior visual quality. The code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Physically-based rendering (PBR) has become a cornerstone in modern computer graphics, enabling realistic material representation and lighting interactions in 3D scenes. In this paper, we present MaterialMVP, a novel end-to-end model for generating PBR textures from 3D meshes and image prompts, addressing key challenges in multi-view material synthesis. Our approach leverages Reference Attention to extract and encode informative latent from the input reference images, enabling intuitive and controllable texture generation. We also introduce a Consistency-Regularized Training strategy to enforce stability across varying viewpoints and illumination conditions, ensuring illumination-invariant and geometrically consistent results. Additionally, we propose Dual-Channel Material Generation, which separately optimizes albedo and metallic-roughness (MR) textures while maintaining precise spatial alignment with the input images through Multi-Channel Aligned Attention. Learnable material embeddings are further integrated to capture the distinct properties of albedo and MR. Experimental results demonstrate that our model generates PBR textures with realistic behavior across diverse lighting scenarios, outperforming existing methods in both consistency and quality for scalable 3D asset creation.

- **Summary**: We introduce VisualPRM, an advanced multimodal Process Reward Model (PRM) with 8B parameters, which improves the reasoning abilities of existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across different model scales and families with Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation strategies. Specifically, our model improves the reasoning performance of three types of MLLMs and four different model scales. Even when applied to the highly capable InternVL2.5-78B, it achieves a 5.9-point improvement across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that our model exhibits superior performance compared to Outcome Reward Models and Self-Consistency during BoN evaluation. To facilitate the training of multimodal PRMs, we construct a multimodal process supervision dataset VisualPRM400K using an automated data pipeline. For the evaluation of multimodal PRMs, we propose VisualProcessBench, a benchmark with human-annotated step-wise correctness labels, to measure the abilities of PRMs to detect erroneous steps in multimodal reasoning tasks. We hope that our work can inspire more future research and contribute to the development of MLLMs. Our model, data, and benchmark are released in https://internvl.github.io/blog/2025-03-13-VisualPRM/.

- **Summary**: This paper discusses the integration challenges and strategies for designing mobile robots, by focusing on the task-driven, optimal selection of hardware and software to balance safety, efficiency, and minimal usage of resources such as costs, energy, computational requirements, and weight. We emphasize the interplay between perception and motion planning in decision-making by introducing the concept of occupancy queries to quantify the perception requirements for sampling-based motion planners. Sensor and algorithm performance are evaluated using False Negative Rates (FPR) and False Positive Rates (FPR) across various factors such as geometric relationships, object properties, sensor resolution, and environmental conditions. By integrating perception requirements with perception performance, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is proposed for efficient sensor and algorithm selection and placement. This forms the basis for a co-design optimization that includes the robot body, motion planner, perception pipeline, and computing unit. We refer to this framework for solving the co-design problem of mobile robots as CODEI, short for Co-design of Embodied Intelligence. A case study on developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) for urban scenarios provides actionable information for designers, and shows that complex tasks escalate resource demands, with task performance affecting choices of the autonomy stack. The study demonstrates that resource prioritization influences sensor choice: cameras are preferred for cost-effective and lightweight designs, while lidar sensors are chosen for better energy and computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Object tracking is an essential task for autonomous systems. With the advancement of 3D sensors, these systems can better perceive their surroundings using effective 3D Extended Object Tracking (EOT) methods. Based on the observation that common road users are symmetrical on the right and left sides in the traveling direction, we focus on the side view profile of the object. In order to leverage of the development in 2D EOT and balance the number of parameters of a shape model in the tracking algorithms, we propose a method for 3D extended object tracking (EOT) by describing the side view profile of the object with B-spline curves and forming an extrusion to obtain a 3D extent. The use of B-spline curves exploits their flexible representation power by allowing the control points to move freely. The algorithm is developed into an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). For a through evaluation of this method, we use simulated traffic scenario of different vehicle models and realworld open dataset containing both radar and lidar data.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot learning holds tremendous potential for histopathology image analysis by enabling models to generalize to unseen classes without extensive labeled data. Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded the capabilities of ZSL, allowing models to perform tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, applying VLMs to histopathology presents considerable challenges due to the complexity of histopathological imagery and the nuanced nature of diagnostic tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Multi-Resolution Prompt-guided Hybrid Embedding (MR-PHE) to address these challenges in zero-shot histopathology image classification. MR-PHE leverages multiresolution patch extraction to mimic the diagnostic workflow of pathologists, capturing both fine-grained cellular details and broader tissue structures critical for accurate diagnosis. We introduce a hybrid embedding strategy that integrates global image embeddings with weighted patch embeddings, effectively combining local and global contextual information. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive prompt generation and selection framework, enriching class descriptions with domain-specific synonyms and clinically relevant features to enhance semantic understanding. A similarity-based patch weighting mechanism assigns attention-like weights to patches based on their relevance to class embeddings, emphasizing diagnostically important regions during classification. Our approach utilizes pretrained VLM, CONCH for ZSL without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, offering scalability and reducing dependence on large annotated datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MR-PHE not only significantly improves zero-shot classification performance on histopathology datasets but also often surpasses fully supervised models.

- **Summary**: Analyzing animal behavior from video recordings is crucial for scientific research, yet manual annotation remains labor-intensive and prone to subjectivity. Efficient segmentation methods are needed to automate this process while maintaining high accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that utilizes eye-tracking data from Aria glasses to generate prompt points, which are then used to produce segmentation masks via a fast zero-shot segmentation model. Additionally, we apply post-processing to refine the prompts, leading to improved segmentation quality. Through our approach, we demonstrate that combining eye-tracking-based annotation with smart prompt refinement can enhance segmentation accuracy, achieving an improvement of 70.6% from 38.8 to 66.2 in the Jaccard Index for segmentation results in the rats dataset.

- **Summary**: We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.

- **Summary**: Early detection of cervical cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality by identifying precancerous lesions as soon as possible. As a result, the use of pap smear screening has significantly increased, leading to a growing demand for automated tools that can assist cytologists managing their rising workload. To address this, the Pap Smear Cell Classification Challenge (PS3C) has been organized in association with ISBI in 2025. This project aims to promote the development of automated tools for pap smear images classification. The analyzed images are grouped into four categories: healthy, unhealthy, both, and rubbish images which are considered as unsuitable for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a two-stage ensemble approach: first, a neural network determines whether an image is rubbish or not. If not, a second neural network classifies the image as containing a healthy cell, an unhealthy cell, or both.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on Internet-scale vision-language data have demonstrated the potential to transfer their knowledge to robotic learning. However, the existing paradigm encounters three critical challenges: (1) expensive inference cost resulting from large-scale model parameters, (2) frequent domain shifts caused by mismatched data modalities, and (3) limited capacity to handle past or future experiences. In this work, we propose LiteVLP, a lightweight, memory-based, and general-purpose vision-language policy generation model. LiteVLP is built upon a pre-trained 1B-parameter VLM and fine-tuned on a tiny-scale and conversation-style robotic dataset. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LiteVLP outperforms state-of-the-art vision-language policy on VIMA-Bench, with minimal training time. Furthermore, LiteVLP exhibits superior inference speed while maintaining exceptional high accuracy. In long-horizon manipulation tasks, LiteVLP also shows remarkable memory ability, outperforming the best-performing baseline model by 18.8%. These results highlight LiteVLP as a promising model to integrating the intelligence of VLMs into robotic learning.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to retrieve specific objects by utilizing complementary information from various modalities. However, existing methods focus on fusing heterogeneous visual features, neglecting the potential benefits of text-based semantic information. To address this issue, we first construct three text-enhanced multi-modal object ReID benchmarks. To be specific, we propose a standardized multi-modal caption generation pipeline for structured and concise text annotations with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Besides, current methods often directly aggregate multi-modal information without selecting representative local features, leading to redundancy and high complexity. To address the above issues, we introduce IDEA, a novel feature learning framework comprising the Inverted Multi-modal Feature Extractor (IMFE) and Cooperative Deformable Aggregation (CDA). The IMFE utilizes Modal Prefixes and an InverseNet to integrate multi-modal information with semantic guidance from inverted text. The CDA adaptively generates sampling positions, enabling the model to focus on the interplay between global features and discriminative local features. With the constructed benchmarks and the proposed modules, our framework can generate more robust multi-modal features under complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Open Semantic Mapping (OSM) is a key technology in robotic perception, combining semantic segmentation and SLAM techniques. This paper introduces a dynamically configurable and highly automated LLM/LVLM-powered pipeline for evaluating OSM solutions called OSMa-Bench (Open Semantic Mapping Benchmark). The study focuses on evaluating state-of-the-art semantic mapping algorithms under varying indoor lighting conditions, a critical challenge in indoor environments. We introduce a novel dataset with simulated RGB-D sequences and ground truth 3D reconstructions, facilitating the rigorous analysis of mapping performance across different lighting conditions. Through experiments on leading models such as ConceptGraphs, BBQ and OpenScene, we evaluate the semantic fidelity of object recognition and segmentation. Additionally, we introduce a Scene Graph evaluation method to analyze the ability of models to interpret semantic structure. The results provide insights into the robustness of these models, forming future research directions for developing resilient and adaptable robotic systems.

- **Summary**: In dynamic environments where new concepts continuously emerge, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) must adapt by learning new classes while retaining previously acquired ones. This challenge is addressed by Class-Incremental Learning (CIL). This paper introduces Generative Binary Memory (GBM), a novel CIL pseudo-replay approach which generates synthetic binary pseudo-exemplars. Relying on Bernoulli Mixture Models (BMMs), GBM effectively models the multi-modal characteristics of class distributions, in a latent, binary space. With a specifically-designed feature binarizer, our approach applies to any conventional DNN. GBM also natively supports Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) for highly-constrained model sizes in embedded systems. The experimental results demonstrate that GBM achieves higher than state-of-the-art average accuracy on CIFAR100 (+2.9%) and TinyImageNet (+1.5%) for a ResNet-18 equipped with our binarizer. GBM also outperforms emerging CIL methods for BNNs, with +3.1% in final accuracy and x4.7 memory reduction, on CORE50.

- **Summary**: Recent developments in generative diffusion models have turned many dreams into realities. For video object insertion, existing methods typically require additional information, such as a reference video or a 3D asset of the object, to generate the synthetic motion. However, inserting an object from a single reference photo into a target background video remains an uncharted area due to the lack of unseen motion information. We propose DreamInsert, which achieves Image-to-Video Object Insertion in a training-free manner for the first time. By incorporating the trajectory of the object into consideration, DreamInsert can predict the unseen object movement, fuse it harmoniously with the background video, and generate the desired video seamlessly. More significantly, DreamInsert is both simple and effective, achieving zero-shot insertion without end-to-end training or additional fine-tuning on well-designed image-video data pairs. We demonstrated the effectiveness of DreamInsert through a variety of experiments. Leveraging this capability, we present the first results for Image-to-Video object insertion in a training-free manner, paving exciting new directions for future content creation and synthesis. The code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: The rapid growth of social media has led to the widespread sharing of individual portrait images, which pose serious privacy risks due to the capabilities of automatic face recognition (AFR) systems for mass surveillance. Hence, protecting facial privacy against unauthorized AFR systems is essential. Inspired by the generation capability of the emerging diffusion models, recent methods employ diffusion models to generate adversarial face images for privacy protection. However, they suffer from the diffusion purification effect, leading to a low protection success rate (PSR). In this paper, we first propose learning unconditional embeddings to increase the learning capacity for adversarial modifications and then use them to guide the modification of the adversarial latent code to weaken the diffusion purification effect. Moreover, we integrate an identity-preserving structure to maintain structural consistency between the original and generated images, allowing human observers to recognize the generated image as having the same identity as the original. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets, i.e., CelebA-HQ and LADN, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The protected faces generated by our method outperform those produced by existing facial privacy protection approaches in terms of transferability and natural appearance.

- **Summary**: AI-based object detection, and efforts to explain and investigate their characteristics, is a topic of high interest. The impact of, e.g., complex background structures with similar appearances as the objects of interest, on the detection accuracy and, beforehand, the necessary dataset composition are topics of ongoing research. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of background influences and different features of the object to be detected. The latter includes various materials and surfaces, partially transparent and with shiny reflections in the context of an Industry 4.0 learning factory. Different YOLOv8 models have been trained for each of the materials on different sized datasets, where the appearance was the only changing parameter. In the end, similar characteristics tend to show different behaviours and sometimes unexpected results. While some background components tend to be detected, others with the same features are not part of the detection. Additionally, some more precise conclusions can be drawn from the results. Therefore, we contribute a challenging dataset with detailed investigations on 92 trained YOLO models, addressing some issues on the detection accuracy and possible overfitting.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the feasibility of using text-to-image models in a zero-shot setup to generate images for taxonomy concepts. While text-based methods for taxonomy enrichment are well-established, the potential of the visual dimension remains unexplored. To address this, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for Taxonomy Image Generation that assesses models' abilities to understand taxonomy concepts and generate relevant, high-quality images. The benchmark includes common-sense and randomly sampled WordNet concepts, alongside the LLM generated predictions. The 12 models are evaluated using 9 novel taxonomy-related text-to-image metrics and human feedback. Moreover, we pioneer the use of pairwise evaluation with GPT-4 feedback for image generation. Experimental results show that the ranking of models differs significantly from standard T2I tasks. Playground-v2 and FLUX consistently outperform across metrics and subsets and the retrieval-based approach performs poorly. These findings highlight the potential for automating the curation of structured data resources.

- **Summary**: Diffusion customization methods have achieved impressive results with only a minimal number of user-provided images. However, existing approaches customize concepts collectively, whereas real-world applications often require sequential concept integration. This sequential nature can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned concepts are lost. In this paper, we investigate concept forgetting and concept confusion in the continual customization. To tackle these challenges, we present ConceptGuard, a comprehensive approach that combines shift embedding, concept-binding prompts and memory preservation regularization, supplemented by a priority queue which can adaptively update the importance and occurrence order of different concepts. These strategies can dynamically update, unbind and learn the relationship of the previous concepts, thus alleviating concept forgetting and confusion. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our approach outperforms all the baseline methods consistently and significantly in both quantitative and qualitative analyses.

- **Summary**: In this paper we study the sparse coding problem in the context of sparse dictionary learning for image recovery. To this end, we consider and compare several state-of-the-art sparse optimization methods constructed using the shrinkage operation. As the mathematical setting of these methods, we consider an online approach as algorithmical basis together with the basis pursuit denoising problem that arises by the convex optimization approach to the dictionary learning problem.   By a dedicated construction of datasets and corresponding dictionaries, we study the effect of enlarging the underlying learning database on reconstruction quality making use of several error measures. Our study illuminates that the choice of the optimization method may be practically important in the context of availability of training data. In the context of different settings for training data as may be considered part of our study, we illuminate the computational efficiency of the assessed optimization methods.

- **Summary**: Advanced generative models excel at synthesizing images but often rely on text-based conditioning. Visual designers, however, often work beyond language, directly drawing inspiration from existing visual elements. In many cases, these elements represent only fragments of a potential concept-such as an uniquely structured wing, or a specific hairstyle-serving as inspiration for the artist to explore how they can come together creatively into a coherent whole. Recognizing this need, we introduce a generative framework that seamlessly integrates a partial set of user-provided visual components into a coherent composition while simultaneously sampling the missing parts needed to generate a plausible and complete concept. Our approach builds on a strong and underexplored representation space, extracted from IP-Adapter+, on which we train IP-Prior, a lightweight flow-matching model that synthesizes coherent compositions based on domain-specific priors, enabling diverse and context-aware generations. Additionally, we present a LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy that significantly improves prompt adherence in IP-Adapter+ for a given task, addressing its common trade-off between reconstruction quality and prompt adherence.

- **Summary**: We introduce LUMOS, a language-conditioned multi-task imitation learning framework for robotics. LUMOS learns skills by practicing them over many long-horizon rollouts in the latent space of a learned world model and transfers these skills zero-shot to a real robot. By learning on-policy in the latent space of the learned world model, our algorithm mitigates policy-induced distribution shift which most offline imitation learning methods suffer from. LUMOS learns from unstructured play data with fewer than 1% hindsight language annotations but is steerable with language commands at test time. We achieve this coherent long-horizon performance by combining latent planning with both image- and language-based hindsight goal relabeling during training, and by optimizing an intrinsic reward defined in the latent space of the world model over multiple time steps, effectively reducing covariate shift. In experiments on the difficult long-horizon CALVIN benchmark, LUMOS outperforms prior learning-based methods with comparable approaches on chained multi-task evaluations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn a language-conditioned continuous visuomotor control for a real-world robot within an offline world model.

- **Summary**: Algorithmic detection of facial palsy offers the potential to improve current practices, which usually involve labor-intensive and subjective assessments by clinicians. In this paper, we present a multimodal fusion-based deep learning model that utilizes an MLP mixer-based model to process unstructured data (i.e. RGB images or images with facial line segments) and a feed-forward neural network to process structured data (i.e. facial landmark coordinates, features of facial expressions, or handcrafted features) for detecting facial palsy. We then contribute to a study to analyze the effect of different data modalities and the benefits of a multimodal fusion-based approach using videos of 20 facial palsy patients and 20 healthy subjects. Our multimodal fusion model achieved 96.00 F1, which is significantly higher than the feed-forward neural network trained on handcrafted features alone (82.80 F1) and an MLP mixer-based model trained on raw RGB images (89.00 F1).

- **Summary**: Video generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of deep generative models, particularly diffusion models. While existing methods excel in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or single images, personalized multi-subject video generation remains a largely unexplored challenge. This task involves synthesizing videos that incorporate multiple distinct subjects, each defined by separate reference images, while ensuring temporal and spatial consistency. Current approaches primarily rely on mapping subject images to keywords in text prompts, which introduces ambiguity and limits their ability to model subject relationships effectively. In this paper, we propose CINEMA, a novel framework for coherent multi-subject video generation by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach eliminates the need for explicit correspondences between subject images and text entities, mitigating ambiguity and reducing annotation effort. By leveraging MLLM to interpret subject relationships, our method facilitates scalability, enabling the use of large and diverse datasets for training. Furthermore, our framework can be conditioned on varying numbers of subjects, offering greater flexibility in personalized content creation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves subject consistency, and overall video coherence, paving the way for advanced applications in storytelling, interactive media, and personalized video generation.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in self-supervised learning for Vision Transformers (ViTs) have fueled breakthroughs in remote sensing (RS) foundation models. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative, existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small, domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2) multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The source code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/RoMA.

- **Summary**: This article presents our results for the eighth Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW) competition. We combine facial emotional descriptors extracted by pre-trained models, namely, our EmotiEffLib library, with acoustic features and embeddings of texts recognized from speech. The frame-level features are aggregated and fed into simple classifiers, e.g., multi-layered perceptron (feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer), to predict ambivalence/hesitancy and facial expressions. In the latter case, we also use the pre-trained facial expression recognition model to select high-score video frames and prevent their processing with a domain-specific video classifier. The video-level prediction of emotional mimicry intensity is implemented by simply aggregating frame-level features and training a multi-layered perceptron. Experimental results for three tasks from the ABAW challenge demonstrate that our approach significantly increases validation metrics compared to existing baselines.

- **Summary**: Recent 3D content generation pipelines often leverage Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode shapes into compact latent representations, facilitating diffusion-based generation. Efficiently compressing 3D shapes while preserving intricate geometric details remains a key challenge. Existing 3D shape VAEs often employ uniform point sampling and 1D/2D latent representations, such as vector sets or triplanes, leading to significant geometric detail loss due to inadequate surface coverage and the absence of explicit 3D representations in the latent space. Although recent work explores 3D latent representations, their large scale hinders high-resolution encoding and efficient training. Given these challenges, we introduce Hyper3D, which enhances VAE reconstruction through efficient 3D representation that integrates hybrid triplane and octree features. First, we adopt an octree-based feature representation to embed mesh information into the network, mitigating the limitations of uniform point sampling in capturing geometric distributions along the mesh surface. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid latent space representation that integrates a high-resolution triplane with a low-resolution 3D grid. This design not only compensates for the lack of explicit 3D representations but also leverages a triplane to preserve high-resolution details. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyper3D outperforms traditional representations by reconstructing 3D shapes with higher fidelity and finer details, making it well-suited for 3D generation pipelines.

- **Summary**: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become an essential tool for designing effective and efficient neural networks. In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of neural architecture spaces commonly used in differentiable NAS methods, specifically NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS. By defining flatness metrics such as neighborhoods and loss barriers along paths in architecture space, we reveal locality and flatness characteristics analogous to the well-known properties of neural network loss landscapes in weight space. In particular, we find that highly accurate architectures cluster together in flat regions, while suboptimal architectures remain isolated, unveiling the detailed geometrical structure of the architecture search landscape. Building on these insights, we propose Architecture-Aware Minimization (A$^2$M), a novel analytically derived algorithmic framework that explicitly biases, for the first time, the gradient of differentiable NAS methods towards flat minima in architecture space. A$^2$M consistently improves generalization over state-of-the-art DARTS-based algorithms on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120, across both NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces. Notably, A$^2$M is able to increase the test accuracy, on average across different differentiable NAS methods, by +3.60\% on CIFAR-10, +4.60\% on CIFAR-100, and +3.64\% on ImageNet16-120, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in practice. A$^2$M can be easily integrated into existing differentiable NAS frameworks, offering a versatile tool for future research and applications in automated machine learning.

- **Summary**: Unifying diverse image generation tasks within a single framework remains a fundamental challenge in visual generation. While large language models (LLMs) achieve unification through task-agnostic data and generation, existing visual generation models fail to meet these principles. Current approaches either rely on per-task datasets and large-scale training or adapt pre-trained image models with task-specific modifications, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we explore video models as a foundation for unified image generation, leveraging their inherent ability to model temporal correlations. We introduce RealGeneral, a novel framework that reformulates image generation as a conditional frame prediction task, analogous to in-context learning in LLMs. To bridge the gap between video models and condition-image pairs, we propose (1) a Unified Conditional Embedding module for multi-modal alignment and (2) a Unified Stream DiT Block with decoupled adaptive LayerNorm and attention mask to mitigate cross-modal interference. RealGeneral demonstrates effectiveness in multiple important visual generation tasks, e.g., it achieves a 14.5% improvement in subject similarity for customized generation and a 10% enhancement in image quality for canny-to-image task.

- **Summary**: Roadside Collaborative Perception refers to a system where multiple roadside units collaborate to pool their perceptual data, assisting vehicles in enhancing their environmental awareness. Existing roadside perception methods concentrate on model design but overlook data issues like calibration errors, sparse information, and multi-view consistency, leading to poor performance on recent published datasets. To significantly enhance roadside collaborative perception and address critical data issues, we present the first simulation framework RoCo-Sim for road-side collaborative perception. RoCo-Sim is capable of generating diverse, multi-view consistent simulated roadside data through dynamic foreground editing and full-scene style transfer of a single image. RoCo-Sim consists of four components: (1) Camera Extrinsic Optimization ensures accurate 3D to 2D projection for roadside cameras; (2) A novel Multi-View Occlusion-Aware Sampler (MOAS) determines the placement of diverse digital assets within 3D space; (3) DepthSAM innovatively models foreground-background relationships from single-frame fixed-view images, ensuring multi-view consistency of foreground; and (4) Scalable Post-Processing Toolkit generates more realistic and enriched scenes through style transfer and other enhancements. RoCo-Sim significantly improves roadside 3D object detection, outperforming SOTA methods by 83.74 on Rcooper-Intersection and 83.12 on TUMTraf-V2X for AP70. RoCo-Sim fills a critical gap in roadside perception simulation. Code and pre-trained models will be released soon: https://github.com/duyuwen-duen/RoCo-Sim

- **Summary**: Nuclei segmentation and classification provide an essential basis for tumor immune microenvironment analysis. The previous nuclei segmentation and classification models require splitting large images into smaller patches for training, leading to two significant issues. First, nuclei at the borders of adjacent patches often misalign during inference. Second, this patch-based approach significantly increases the model's training and inference time. Recently, Mamba has garnered attention for its ability to model large-scale images with linear time complexity and low memory consumption. It offers a promising solution for training nuclei segmentation and classification models on full-sized images. However, the Mamba orientation-based scanning method lacks account for category-specific features, resulting in sub-optimal performance in scenarios with imbalanced class distributions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel scanning strategy based on category probability sorting, which independently ranks and scans features for each category according to confidence from high to low. This approach enhances the feature representation of uncertain samples and mitigates the issues caused by imbalanced distributions. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior performance in nuclei segmentation and classification tasks.

- **Summary**: The improper disposal and mismanagement of medical waste pose severe environmental and public health risks, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and the spread of infectious diseases. Efficient and accurate medical waste classification is crucial for mitigating these risks. We explore the integration of capsule networks with a pretrained DenseNet model to improve medical waste classification. To the best of our knowledge, capsule networks have not yet been applied to this task, making this study the first to assess their effectiveness.   A diverse dataset of medical waste images collected from multiple public sources, is used to evaluate three model configurations: (1) a pretrained DenseNet model as a baseline, (2) a pretrained DenseNet with frozen layers combined with a capsule network, and (3) a pretrained DenseNet with unfrozen layers combined with a capsule network. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating capsule networks improves classification performance, with F1 scores increasing from 0.89 (baseline) to 0.92 (hybrid model with unfrozen layers). This highlights the potential of capsule networks to address the spatial limitations of traditional convolutional models and improve classification robustness.   While the capsule-enhanced model demonstrated improved classification performance, direct comparisons with prior studies were challenging due to differences in dataset size and diversity. Previous studies relied on smaller, domain-specific datasets, which inherently yielded higher accuracy. In contrast, our study employs a significantly larger and more diverse dataset, leading to better generalization but introducing additional classification challenges. This highlights the trade-off between dataset complexity and model performance.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods for point tracking are applicable in 2D echocardiography, but do not yet take advantage of domain specifics that enable extremely fast and efficient configurations. We developed MyoTracker, a low-complexity architecture (0.3M parameters) for point tracking in echocardiography. It builds on the CoTracker2 architecture by simplifying its components and extending the temporal context to provide point predictions for the entire sequence in a single step. We applied MyoTracker to the right ventricular (RV) myocardium in RV-focused recordings and compared the results with those of CoTracker2 and EchoTracker, another specialized point tracking architecture for echocardiography. MyoTracker achieved the lowest average point trajectory error at 2.00 $\pm$ 0.53 mm. Calculating RV Free Wall Strain (RV FWS) using MyoTracker's point predictions resulted in a -0.3$\%$ bias with 95$\%$ limits of agreement from -6.1$\%$ to 5.4$\%$ compared to reference values from commercial software. This range falls within the interobserver variability reported in previous studies. The limits of agreement were wider for both CoTracker2 and EchoTracker, worse than the interobserver variability. At inference, MyoTracker used 67$\%$ less GPU memory than CoTracker2 and 84$\%$ less than EchoTracker on large sequences (100 frames). MyoTracker was 74 times faster during inference than CoTracker2 and 11 times faster than EchoTracker with our setup. Maintaining the entire sequence in the temporal context was the greatest contributor to MyoTracker's accuracy. Slight additional gains can be made by re-enabling iterative refinement, at the cost of longer processing time.

- **Summary**: Generating human-like and adaptive trajectories is essential for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of human driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving preferences. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95 on NavSim benchmark, significantly exceeding other methods. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Learning 4D language fields to enable time-sensitive, open-ended language queries in dynamic scenes is essential for many real-world applications. While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both time-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.

- **Summary**: Exemplar-Free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to learn from a sequence of tasks without having access to previous task data. In this paper, we consider the challenging Cold Start scenario in which insufficient data is available in the first task to learn a high-quality backbone. This is especially challenging for EFCIL since it requires high plasticity, resulting in feature drift which is difficult to compensate for in the exemplar-free setting. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach to consolidate feature representations by regularizing drift in directions highly relevant to previous tasks and employs prototypes to reduce task-recency bias. Our approach, which we call Elastic Feature Consolidation++ (EFC++) exploits a tractable second-order approximation of feature drift based on a proposed Empirical Feature Matrix (EFM). The EFM induces a pseudo-metric in feature space which we use to regularize feature drift in important directions and to update Gaussian prototypes. In addition, we introduce a post-training prototype re-balancing phase that updates classifiers to compensate for feature drift. Experimental results on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-Subset, ImageNet-1K and DomainNet demonstrate that EFC++ is better able to learn new tasks by maintaining model plasticity and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Learning from noisy ordinal labels is a key challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we ask whether ordinal disease progression labels (better, worse, or stable) can be used to learn a representation allowing to classify disease state. For neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), we cast the problem of modeling disease progression between medical visits as a classification task with ordinal ranks. To enhance generalization, we tailor our model to the problem setting by (1) independent image encoding, (2) antisymmetric logit space equivariance, and (3) ordinal scale awareness. In addition, we address label noise by learning an uncertainty estimate for loss re-weighting. Our approach learns an interpretable disease representation enabling strong few-shot performance for the related task of nAMD activity classification from single images, despite being trained only on image pairs with ordinal disease progression labels.

- **Summary**: Over the past decade, studying animal behaviour with the help of computer vision has become more popular. Replacing human observers by computer vision lowers the cost of data collection and therefore allows to collect more extensive datasets. However, the majority of available computer vision algorithms to study animal behaviour is highly tailored towards a single research objective, limiting possibilities for data reuse. In this perspective, pose-estimation in combination with animal tracking offers opportunities to yield a higher level representation capturing both the spatial and temporal component of animal behaviour. Such a higher level representation allows to answer a wide variety of research questions simultaneously, without the need to develop repeatedly tailored computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we therefore first cope with several weaknesses of current pose-estimation algorithms and thereafter introduce KeySORT (Keypoint Simple and Online Realtime Tracking). KeySORT deploys an adaptive Kalman filter to construct tracklets in a bounding-box free manner, significantly improving the temporal consistency of detected keypoints. In this paper, we focus on pose estimation in cattle, but our methodology can easily be generalised to any other animal species. Our test results indicate our algorithm is able to detect up to 80% of the ground truth keypoints with high accuracy, with only a limited drop in performance when daylight recordings are compared to nightvision recordings. Moreover, by using KeySORT to construct skeletons, the temporal consistency of generated keypoint coordinates was largely improved, offering opportunities with regard to automated behaviour monitoring of animals.

- **Summary**: Learning accurate scene reconstruction without pose priors in neural radiance fields is challenging due to inherent geometric ambiguity. Recent development either relies on correspondence priors for regularization or uses off-the-shelf flow estimators to derive analytical poses. However, the potential for jointly learning scene geometry, camera poses, and dense flow within a unified neural representation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Flow-NeRF, a unified framework that simultaneously optimizes scene geometry, camera poses, and dense optical flow all on-the-fly. To enable the learning of dense flow within the neural radiance field, we design and build a bijective mapping for flow estimation, conditioned on pose. To make the scene reconstruction benefit from the flow estimation, we develop an effective feature enhancement mechanism to pass canonical space features to world space representations, significantly enhancing scene geometry. We validate our model across four important tasks, i.e., novel view synthesis, depth estimation, camera pose prediction, and dense optical flow estimation, using several datasets. Our approach surpasses previous methods in almost all metrics for novel-view view synthesis and depth estimation and yields both qualitatively sound and quantitatively accurate novel-view flow.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging for deep learning models, particularly when test-time OOD samples differ significantly from training outliers. We propose OODD, a novel test-time OOD detection method that dynamically maintains and updates an OOD dictionary without fine-tuning. Our approach leverages a priority queue-based dictionary that accumulates representative OOD features during testing, combined with an informative inlier sampling strategy for in-distribution (ID) samples. To ensure stable performance during early testing, we propose a dual OOD stabilization mechanism that leverages strategically generated outliers derived from ID data. To our best knowledge, extensive experiments on the OpenOOD benchmark demonstrate that OODD significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 26.0% improvement in FPR95 on CIFAR-100 Far OOD detection compared to the state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, we present an optimized variant of the KNN-based OOD detection framework that achieves a 3x speedup while maintaining detection performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown promise for embodied task planning, yet they struggle with fundamental challenges like dependency constraints and efficiency. Existing approaches either solely optimize action selection or leverage world models during inference, overlooking the benefits of learning to model the world as a way to enhance planning capabilities. We propose Dual Preference Optimization (D$^2$PO), a new learning framework that jointly optimizes state prediction and action selection through preference learning, enabling LVLMs to understand environment dynamics for better planning. To automatically collect trajectories and stepwise preference data without human annotation, we introduce a tree search mechanism for extensive exploration via trial-and-error. Extensive experiments on VoTa-Bench demonstrate that our D$^2$PO-based method significantly outperforms existing methods and GPT-4o when applied to Qwen2-VL (7B), LLaVA-1.6 (7B), and LLaMA-3.2 (11B), achieving superior task success rates with more efficient execution paths.

- **Summary**: Generating co-speech gestures in real time requires both temporal coherence and efficient sampling. We introduce Accelerated Rolling Diffusion, a novel framework for streaming gesture generation that extends rolling diffusion models with structured progressive noise scheduling, enabling seamless long-sequence motion synthesis while preserving realism and diversity. We further propose Rolling Diffusion Ladder Acceleration (RDLA), a new approach that restructures the noise schedule into a stepwise ladder, allowing multiple frames to be denoised simultaneously. This significantly improves sampling efficiency while maintaining motion consistency, achieving up to a 2x speedup with high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. We evaluate our approach on ZEGGS and BEAT, strong benchmarks for real-world applicability. Our framework is universally applicable to any diffusion-based gesture generation model, transforming it into a streaming approach. Applied to three state-of-the-art methods, it consistently outperforms them, demonstrating its effectiveness as a generalizable and efficient solution for real-time, high-fidelity co-speech gesture synthesis.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose spatio-temporal omni-object video grounding, dubbed OmniSTVG, a new STVG task that aims at localizing spatially and temporally all targets mentioned in the textual query from videos. Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG. Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at https://github.com/JellyYao3000/OmniSTVG.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming increasingly popular, while the high computational cost associated with multimodal data input, particularly from visual tokens, poses a significant challenge. Existing training-based token compression methods improve inference efficiency but require costly retraining, while training-free methods struggle to maintain performance when aggressively reducing token counts. In this study, we reveal that the performance degradation of MLLM closely correlates with the accelerated loss of information in the attention output matrix. This insight introduces a novel information-preserving perspective, making it possible to maintain performance even under extreme token compression. Based on this finding, we propose TokenCarve, a training-free, plug-and-play, two-stage token compression framework. The first stage employs an Information-Preservation-Guided Selection (IPGS) strategy to prune low-information tokens, while the second stage further leverages IPGS to guide token merging, minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets and 2 model variants demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenCarve. It can even reduce the number of visual tokens to 22.2% of the original count, achieving a 1.23x speedup in inference, a 64% reduction in KV cache storage, and only a 1.54% drop in accuracy.

- **Summary**: In the domain of Image Anomaly Detection (IAD), Existing methods frequently exhibit a paucity of fine-grained, interpretable semantic information, resulting in the detection of anomalous entities or activities that are susceptible to machine illusions. This deficiency often leads to the detection of anomalous entities or actions that are susceptible to machine illusions and lack sufficient explanation. In this thesis, we propose a novel approach to anomaly detection, termed Hoi2Anomaly, which aims to achieve precise discrimination and localization of anomalies. The proposed methodology involves the construction of a multi-modal instruction tuning dataset comprising human-object interaction (HOI) pairs in anomalous scenarios. Second, we have trained an HOI extractor in threat scenarios to localize and match anomalous actions and entities. Finally, explanatory content is generated for the detected anomalous HOI by fine-tuning the visual language pretraining (VLP) framework. The experimental results demonstrate that Hoi2Anomaly surpasses existing generative approaches in terms of precision and explainability. We will release Hoi2Anomaly for the advancement of the field of anomaly detection.

- **Summary**: Quality control of medical images is a critical component of digital pathology, ensuring that diagnostic images meet required standards. A pre-analytical task within this process is the verification of the number of specimen fragments, a process that ensures that the number of fragments on a slide matches the number documented in the macroscopic report. This step is important to ensure that the slides contain the appropriate diagnostic material from the grossing process, thereby guaranteeing the accuracy of subsequent microscopic examination and diagnosis. Traditionally, this assessment is performed manually, requiring significant time and effort while being subject to significant variability due to its subjective nature. To address these challenges, this study explores an automated approach to fragment counting using the YOLOv9 and Vision Transformer models. Our results demonstrate that the automated system achieves a level of performance comparable to expert assessments, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to manual counting. Additionally, we present findings on interobserver variability, showing that the automated approach achieves an accuracy of 86%, which falls within the range of variation observed among experts (82-88%), further supporting its potential for integration into routine pathology workflows.

- **Summary**: Audio and music generation have emerged as crucial tasks in many applications, yet existing approaches face significant limitations: they operate in isolation without unified capabilities across modalities, suffer from scarce high-quality, multi-modal training data, and struggle to effectively integrate diverse inputs. In this work, we propose AudioX, a unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation. Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image, music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music captions derived from the V2M dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioX not only matches or outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models, but also offers remarkable versatility in handling diverse input modalities and generation tasks within a unified architecture. The code and datasets will be available at https://zeyuet.github.io/AudioX/

- **Summary**: This paper presents our method for the estimation of valence-arousal (VA) in the 8th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW) competition. Our approach integrates visual and audio information through a multimodal framework. The visual branch uses a pre-trained ResNet model to extract spatial features from facial images. The audio branches employ pre-trained VGG models to extract VGGish and LogMel features from speech signals. These features undergo temporal modeling using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). We then apply cross-modal attention mechanisms, where visual features interact with audio features through query-key-value attention structures. Finally, the features are concatenated and passed through a regression layer to predict valence and arousal. Our method achieves competitive performance on the Aff-Wild2 dataset, demonstrating effective multimodal fusion for VA estimation in-the-wild.

- **Summary**: Political polarization is a significant issue in American politics, influencing public discourse, policy, and consumer behavior. While studies on polarization in news media have extensively focused on verbal content, non-verbal elements, particularly visual content, have received less attention due to the complexity and high dimensionality of image data. Traditional descriptive approaches often rely on feature extraction from images, leading to biased polarization estimates due to information loss. In this paper, we introduce the Polarization Measurement using Counterfactual Image Generation (PMCIG) method, which combines economic theory with generative models and multi-modal deep learning to fully utilize the richness of image data and provide a theoretically grounded measure of polarization in visual content. Applying this framework to a decade-long dataset featuring 30 prominent politicians across 20 major news outlets, we identify significant polarization in visual content, with notable variations across outlets and politicians. At the news outlet level, we observe significant heterogeneity in visual slant. Outlets such as Daily Mail, Fox News, and Newsmax tend to favor Republican politicians in their visual content, while The Washington Post, USA Today, and The New York Times exhibit a slant in favor of Democratic politicians. At the politician level, our results reveal substantial variation in polarized coverage, with Donald Trump and Barack Obama among the most polarizing figures, while Joe Manchin and Susan Collins are among the least. Finally, we conduct a series of validation tests demonstrating the consistency of our proposed measures with external measures of media slant that rely on non-image-based sources.

- **Summary**: Cross-modal retrieval aims to bridge the semantic gap between different modalities, such as visual and textual data, enabling accurate retrieval across them. Despite significant advancements with models like CLIP that align cross-modal representations, a persistent challenge remains: the hubness problem, where a small subset of samples (hubs) dominate as nearest neighbors, leading to biased representations and degraded retrieval accuracy. Existing methods often mitigate hubness through post-hoc normalization techniques, relying on prior data distributions that may not be practical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we directly mitigate hubness during training and introduce NeighborRetr, a novel method that effectively balances the learning of hubs and adaptively adjusts the relations of various kinds of neighbors. Our approach not only mitigates the hubness problem but also enhances retrieval performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple cross-modal retrieval benchmarks. Furthermore, NeighborRetr demonstrates robust generalization to new domains with substantial distribution shifts, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications. We make our code publicly available at: https://github.com/zzezze/NeighborRetr .

- **Summary**: Reconstructing accelerated MRI is an ill-posed problem. Machine learning has recently shown great promise at this task, but current approaches to quantifying uncertainty focus on measuring the variability in pixelwise intensity variation. Although these provide interpretable maps, they lack structural understanding and they do not have a clear relationship to how the data will be analysed subsequently. In this paper, we propose a new approach to evaluating reconstruction variability based on apparent anatomical changes in the reconstruction, which is more tightly related to common downstream tasks. We use image registration and segmentation to evaluate several common MRI reconstruction approaches, where uncertainty is measured via ensembling, for accelerated imaging. We demonstrate the intrinsic variability in reconstructed images and show that models with high scores on often used quality metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, can nonetheless display high levels of variance and bias in anatomical measures.

- **Summary**: 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently made substantial advancements. However, their potential remains untapped, primarily due to the limited quantity and suboptimal quality of 3D datasets. Current approaches attempt to transfer knowledge from 2D MLLMs to expand 3D instruction data, but still face modality and domain gaps. To this end, we introduce PiSA-Engine (Point-Self-Augmented-Engine), a new framework for generating instruction point-language datasets enriched with 3D spatial semantics. We observe that existing 3D MLLMs offer a comprehensive understanding of point clouds for annotation, while 2D MLLMs excel at cross-validation by providing complementary information. By integrating holistic 2D and 3D insights from off-the-shelf MLLMs, PiSA-Engine enables a continuous cycle of high-quality data generation. We select PointLLM as the baseline and adopt this co-evolution training framework to develop an enhanced 3D MLLM, termed PointLLM-PiSA. Additionally, we identify limitations in previous 3D benchmarks, which often feature coarse language captions and insufficient category diversity, resulting in inaccurate evaluations. To address this gap, we further introduce PiSA-Bench, a comprehensive 3D benchmark covering six key aspects with detailed and diverse labels. Experimental results demonstrate PointLLM-PiSA's state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D object captioning and generative classification on our PiSA-Bench, achieving significant improvements of 46.45% (+8.33%) and 63.75% (+16.25%), respectively. We will release the code, datasets, and benchmark.

- **Summary**: In this study, we present an approach for efficient spatiotemporal feature extraction using MobileNetV4 and a multi-scale 3D MLP-Mixer-based temporal aggregation module. MobileNetV4, with its Universal Inverted Bottleneck (UIB) blocks, serves as the backbone for extracting hierarchical feature representations from input image sequences, ensuring both computational efficiency and rich semantic encoding. To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce a three-level MLP-Mixer module, which processes spatial features at multiple resolutions while maintaining structural integrity. Experimental results on the ABAW 8th competition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in affective behavior analysis. By integrating an efficient vision backbone with a structured temporal modeling mechanism, the proposed framework achieves a balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, making it well-suited for real-time applications in mobile and embedded computing environments.

- **Summary**: We propose a general framework called VisionLogic to extract interpretable logic rules from deep vision models, with a focus on image classification tasks. Given any deep vision model that uses a fully connected layer as the output head, VisionLogic transforms neurons in the last layer into predicates and grounds them into vision concepts using causal validation. In this way, VisionLogic can provide local explanations for single images and global explanations for specific classes in the form of logic rules. Compared to existing interpretable visualization tools such as saliency maps, VisionLogic addresses several key challenges, including the lack of causal explanations, overconfidence in visualizations, and ambiguity in interpretation. VisionLogic also facilitates the study of visual concepts encoded by predicates, particularly how they behave under perturbation -- an area that remains underexplored in the field of hidden semantics. Apart from providing better visual explanations and insights into the visual concepts learned by the model, we show that VisionLogic retains most of the neural network's discriminative power in an interpretable and transparent manner. We envision it as a bridge between complex model behavior and human-understandable explanations, providing trustworthy and actionable insights for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: As facial recognition is increasingly adopted for government and commercial services, its potential misuse has raised serious concerns about privacy and civil rights. To counteract, various anti-facial recognition techniques have been proposed for privacy protection by adversarially perturbing face images, among which generative makeup-based approaches are the most popular. However, these methods, designed primarily to impersonate specific target identities, can only achieve weak dodging success rates while increasing the risk of targeted abuse. In addition, they often introduce global visual artifacts or a lack of adaptability to accommodate diverse makeup prompts, compromising user satisfaction. To address the above limitations, we develop MASQUE, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates localized adversarial makeups guided by user-defined text prompts. Built upon precise null-text inversion, customized cross-attention fusion with masking, and a pairwise adversarial guidance mechanism using images of the same individual, MASQUE achieves robust dodging performance without requiring any external identity. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source facial recognition models and commercial APIs demonstrate that MASQUE significantly improves dodging success rates over all baselines, along with higher perceptual fidelity and stronger adaptability to various text makeup prompts.

- **Summary**: N-shot neural architecture search (NAS) exploits a supernet containing all candidate subnets for a given search space. The subnets are typically trained with a static training strategy (e.g., using the same learning rate (LR) scheduler and optimizer for all subnets). This, however, does not consider that individual subnets have distinct characteristics, leading to two problems: (1) The supernet training is biased towards the low-complexity subnets (unfairness); (2) the momentum update in the supernet is noisy (noisy momentum). We present a dynamic supernet training technique to address these problems by adjusting the training strategy adaptive to the subnets. Specifically, we introduce a complexity-aware LR scheduler (CaLR) that controls the decay ratio of LR adaptive to the complexities of subnets, which alleviates the unfairness problem. We also present a momentum separation technique (MS). It groups the subnets with similar structural characteristics and uses a separate momentum for each group, avoiding the noisy momentum problem. Our approach can be applicable to various N-shot NAS methods with marginal cost, while improving the search performance drastically. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on various search spaces (e.g., NAS-Bench-201, Mobilenet spaces) and datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet).

- **Summary**: We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel guided decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.94 with only 64 sampling steps, achieving over a 20-fold increase in throughput while reducing memory consumption by over 75% compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-based 3D object detection presents significant challenges due to the inherent sparsity of LiDAR points. A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models have made significant progress on many perception-focused tasks. However, their progress on reasoning-focused tasks remains limited due to the lack of high-quality and diverse training data. In this work, we aim to address the scarcity of reasoning-focused multimodal datasets. We propose VisualWebInstruct, a novel approach that leverages search engines to create a diverse and high-quality dataset spanning multiple disciplines, including mathematics, physics, finance, and chemistry, etc. Starting with a meticulously selected set of 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image Search to identify websites containing similar images. We collect and process HTML data from over 700K unique URLs. Through a pipeline of content extraction, filtering, and synthesis, we construct a dataset of approximately 900K question-answer (QA) pairs, with 40% consisting of visual QA pairs and the remaining comprising text-based QA pairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant performance improvements: (1) fine-tuning on Llava-OV results in 10-20 absolute points improvement across benchmarks, and (2) fine-tuning from MAmmoTH-VL yields a 5 absolute points gain across benchmarks. Our best model, MAmmoTH-VL2, achieves state-of-the-art performance within the 10B parameter class on MMMU-Pro (40.7), MathVerse (42.6), and DynaMath (55.7). These results highlight the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models for complex multimodal tasks.

- **Summary**: Recent Vision-based Large Language Models~(VisionLLMs) for autonomous driving have seen rapid advancements. However, such promotion is extremely dependent on large-scale high-quality annotated data, which is costly and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose unlocking the value of abundant yet unlabeled data to improve the language-driving model in a semi-supervised learning manner. Specifically, we first introduce a series of template-based prompts to extract scene information, generating questions that create pseudo-answers for the unlabeled data based on a model trained with limited labeled data. Next, we propose a Self-Consistency Refinement method to improve the quality of these pseudo-annotations, which are later used for further training. By utilizing a pre-trained VisionLLM (e.g., InternVL), we build a strong Language Driving Model (LDM) for driving scene question-answering, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM benchmark show that our approach performs well with just 5% labeled data, achieving competitive performance against models trained with full datasets. In particular, our LDM achieves 44.85% performance with limited labeled data, increasing to 54.27% when using unlabeled data, while models trained with full datasets reach 60.68% on the DriveLM benchmark.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in video generation can produce realistic, minute-long single-shot videos with scalable diffusion transformers. However, real-world narrative videos require multi-shot scenes with visual and dynamic consistency across shots. In this work, we introduce Long Context Tuning (LCT), a training paradigm that expands the context window of pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models to learn scene-level consistency directly from data. Our method expands full attention mechanisms from individual shots to encompass all shots within a scene, incorporating interleaved 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy, enabling both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. Models with bidirectional attention after LCT can further be fine-tuned with context-causal attention, facilitating auto-regressive generation with efficient KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate single-shot models after LCT can produce coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibit emerging capabilities, including compositional generation and interactive shot extension, paving the way for more practical visual content creation.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces CameraCtrl II, a framework that enables large-scale dynamic scene exploration through a camera-controlled video diffusion model. Previous camera-conditioned video generative models suffer from diminished video dynamics and limited range of viewpoints when generating videos with large camera movement. We take an approach that progressively expands the generation of dynamic scenes -- first enhancing dynamic content within individual video clip, then extending this capability to create seamless explorations across broad viewpoint ranges. Specifically, we construct a dataset featuring a large degree of dynamics with camera parameter annotations for training while designing a lightweight camera injection module and training scheme to preserve dynamics of the pretrained models. Building on these improved single-clip techniques, we enable extended scene exploration by allowing users to iteratively specify camera trajectories for generating coherent video sequences. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that CameraCtrl Ii enables camera-controlled dynamic scene synthesis with substantially wider spatial exploration than previous approaches.

- **Summary**: The structural analogies of ResNets and Multigrid (MG) methods such as common building blocks like convolutions and poolings where already pointed out by He et al.\ in 2016. Multigrid methods are used in the context of scientific computing for solving large sparse linear systems arising from partial differential equations. MG methods particularly rely on two main concepts: smoothing and residual restriction / coarsening. Exploiting these analogies, He and Xu developed the MgNet framework, which integrates MG schemes into the design of ResNets. In this work, we introduce a novel neural network building block inspired by polynomial smoothers from MG theory. Our polynomial block from an MG perspective naturally extends the MgNet framework to Poly-Mgnet and at the same time reduces the number of weights in MgNet. We present a comprehensive study of our polynomial block, analyzing the choice of initial coefficients, the polynomial degree, the placement of activation functions, as well as of batch normalizations. Our results demonstrate that constructing (quadratic) polynomial building blocks based on real and imaginary polynomial roots enhances Poly-MgNet's capacity in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, our approach achieves an improved trade-off of model accuracy and number of weights compared to ResNet as well as compared to specific configurations of MgNet.

- **Summary**: Pixel grounding, encompassing tasks such as Referring Expression Segmentation (RES), has garnered considerable attention due to its immense potential for bridging the gap between vision and language modalities. However, advancements in this domain are currently constrained by limitations inherent in existing datasets, including limited object categories, insufficient textual diversity, and a scarcity of high-quality annotations. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce GroundingSuite, which comprises: (1) an automated data annotation framework leveraging multiple Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents; (2) a large-scale training dataset encompassing 9.56 million diverse referring expressions and their corresponding segmentations; and (3) a meticulously curated evaluation benchmark consisting of 3,800 images. The GroundingSuite training dataset facilitates substantial performance improvements, enabling models trained on it to achieve state-of-the-art results. Specifically, a cIoU of 68.9 on gRefCOCO and a gIoU of 55.3 on RefCOCOm. Moreover, the GroundingSuite annotation framework demonstrates superior efficiency compared to the current leading data annotation method, i.e., $4.5 \times$ faster than the GLaMM.

- **Summary**: We present GroomLight, a novel method for relightable hair appearance modeling from multi-view images. Existing hair capture methods struggle to balance photorealistic rendering with relighting capabilities. Analytical material models, while physically grounded, often fail to fully capture appearance details. Conversely, neural rendering approaches excel at view synthesis but generalize poorly to novel lighting conditions. GroomLight addresses this challenge by combining the strengths of both paradigms. It employs an extended hair BSDF model to capture primary light transport and a light-aware residual model to reconstruct the remaining details. We further propose a hybrid inverse rendering pipeline to optimize both components, enabling high-fidelity relighting, view synthesis, and material editing. Extensive evaluations on real-world hair data demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our method.

- **Summary**: Object Hallucination (OH) has been acknowledged as one of the major trustworthy challenges in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the "overall truthfulness" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as "per-token" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist "generic truthful directions" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that TruthPrInt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/TruthPrInt.

- **Summary**: Emotional Mimicry Intensity (EMI) estimation serves as a critical technology for understanding human social behavior and enhancing human-computer interaction experiences, where the core challenge lies in dynamic correlation modeling and robust fusion of multimodal temporal signals. To address the limitations of existing methods in insufficient exploitation of modal synergistic effects, noise sensitivity, and limited fine-grained alignment capabilities, this paper proposes a dual-stage cross-modal alignment framework. First, we construct vision-text and audio-text contrastive learning networks based on an improved CLIP architecture, achieving preliminary alignment in the feature space through modality-decoupled pre-training. Subsequently, we design a temporal-aware dynamic fusion module that combines Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and gated bidirectional LSTM to respectively capture the macro-evolution patterns of facial expressions and local dynamics of acoustic features. Innovatively, we introduce a quality-guided modality fusion strategy that enables modality compensation under occlusion and noisy scenarios through differentiable weight allocation. Experimental results on the Hume-Vidmimic2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.35 across six emotion dimensions, outperforming the best baseline by 40\%. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the dual-stage training strategy and dynamic fusion mechanism, providing a novel technical pathway for fine-grained emotion analysis in open environments.

- **Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in radiance fields have significantly advanced 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis (NVS) in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, critical limitations persist: reconstruction-based methods exhibit substantial performance deterioration under significant viewpoint deviations from training trajectories, while generation-based techniques struggle with temporal coherence and precise scene controllability. To overcome these challenges, we present MuDG, an innovative framework that integrates Multi-modal Diffusion model with Gaussian Splatting (GS) for Urban Scene Reconstruction. MuDG leverages aggregated LiDAR point clouds with RGB and geometric priors to condition a multi-modal video diffusion model, synthesizing photorealistic RGB, depth, and semantic outputs for novel viewpoints. This synthesis pipeline enables feed-forward NVS without computationally intensive per-scene optimization, providing comprehensive supervision signals to refine 3DGS representations for rendering robustness enhancement under extreme viewpoint changes. Experiments on the Open Waymo Dataset demonstrate that MuDG outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction and synthesis quality.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving has the potential to significantly enhance productivity and provide numerous societal benefits. Ensuring robustness in these safety-critical systems is essential, particularly when vehicles must navigate adverse weather conditions and sensor corruptions that may not have been encountered during training. Current methods often overlook uncertainties arising from adversarial conditions or distributional shifts, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose an efficient adaptation of an uncertainty estimation technique for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method dynamically calibrates model confidence using epistemic uncertainty estimates. Our evaluation under various camera corruption scenarios, such as fog or missing cameras, demonstrates that our approach effectively quantifies epistemic uncertainty by assigning higher uncertainty values to unseen data. We introduce region-specific corruptions to simulate defects affecting only a single camera and validate our findings through both scene-level and region-level assessments. Our results show superior performance in Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection and confidence calibration compared to common baselines such as Deep Ensembles and MC-Dropout. Our approach consistently demonstrates reliable uncertainty measures, indicating its potential for enhancing the robustness of autonomous driving systems in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image models like stable diffusion and DALLE-3 still struggle with multi-turn image editing. We decompose such a task as an agentic workflow (path) of tool use that addresses a sequence of subtasks by AI tools of varying costs. Conventional search algorithms require expensive exploration to find tool paths. While large language models (LLMs) possess prior knowledge of subtask planning, they may lack accurate estimations of capabilities and costs of tools to determine which to apply in each subtask. Can we combine the strengths of both LLMs and graph search to find cost-efficient tool paths? We propose a three-stage approach "CoSTA*" that leverages LLMs to create a subtask tree, which helps prune a graph of AI tools for the given task, and then conducts A* search on the small subgraph to find a tool path. To better balance the total cost and quality, CoSTA* combines both metrics of each tool on every subtask to guide the A* search. Each subtask's output is then evaluated by a vision-language model (VLM), where a failure will trigger an update of the tool's cost and quality on the subtask. Hence, the A* search can recover from failures quickly to explore other paths. Moreover, CoSTA* can automatically switch between modalities across subtasks for a better cost-quality trade-off. We build a novel benchmark of challenging multi-turn image editing, on which CoSTA* outperforms state-of-the-art image-editing models or agents in terms of both cost and quality, and performs versatile trade-offs upon user preference.

- **Summary**: Style transfer involves transferring the style from a reference image to the content of a target image. Recent advancements in LoRA-based (Low-Rank Adaptation) methods have shown promise in effectively capturing the style of a single image. However, these approaches still face significant challenges such as content inconsistency, style misalignment, and content leakage. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the limitations of the standard diffusion parameterization, which learns to predict noise, in the context of style transfer. To address these issues, we introduce ConsisLoRA, a LoRA-based method that enhances both content and style consistency by optimizing the LoRA weights to predict the original image rather than noise. We also propose a two-step training strategy that decouples the learning of content and style from the reference image. To effectively capture both the global structure and local details of the content image, we introduce a stepwise loss transition strategy. Additionally, we present an inference guidance method that enables continuous control over content and style strengths during inference. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, our method demonstrates significant improvements in content and style consistency while effectively reducing content leakage.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capability in complex textual tasks. However, multimodal reasoning, which requires integrating visual and textual information, remains a significant challenge. Existing visual-language models often struggle to effectively analyze and reason visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks hinders the accurate assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce R1-Onevision, a multimodal reasoning model designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and deep reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a cross-modal reasoning pipeline that transforms images into formal textural representations, enabling precise language-based reasoning. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct the R1-Onevision dataset which provides detailed, step-by-step multimodal reasoning annotations across diverse domains. We further develop the R1-Onevision model through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to cultivate advanced reasoning and robust generalization abilities. To comprehensively evaluate multimodal reasoning performance across different grades, we introduce R1-Onevision-Bench, a benchmark aligned with human educational stages, covering exams from junior high school to university and beyond. Experimental results show that R1-Onevision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming models such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL on multiple challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary multiple object tracking aims to generalize trackers to unseen categories during training, enabling their application across a variety of real-world scenarios. However, the existing open-vocabulary tracker is constrained by its framework structure, isolated frame-level perception, and insufficient modal interactions, which hinder its performance in open-vocabulary classification and tracking. In this paper, we propose OVTR (End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking with TRansformer), the first end-to-end open-vocabulary tracker that models motion, appearance, and category simultaneously. To achieve stable classification and continuous tracking, we design the CIP (Category Information Propagation) strategy, which establishes multiple high-level category information priors for subsequent frames. Additionally, we introduce a dual-branch structure for generalization capability and deep multimodal interaction, and incorporate protective strategies in the decoder to enhance performance. Experimental results show that our method surpasses previous trackers on the open-vocabulary MOT benchmark while also achieving faster inference speeds and significantly reducing preprocessing requirements. Moreover, the experiment transferring the model to another dataset demonstrates its strong adaptability. Models and code are released at https://github.com/jinyanglii/OVTR.

- **Summary**: Progress in 3D vision-language learning has been hindered by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. We introduce UniVLG, a unified architecture for 2D and 3D vision-language understanding that bridges the gap between existing 2D-centric models and the rich 3D sensory data available in embodied systems. Our approach initializes most model weights from pre-trained 2D models and trains on both 2D and 3D vision-language data. We propose a novel language-conditioned mask decoder shared across 2D and 3D modalities to ground objects effectively in both RGB and RGB-D images, outperforming box-based approaches. To further reduce the domain gap between 2D and 3D, we incorporate 2D-to-3D lifting strategies, enabling UniVLG to utilize 2D data to enhance 3D performance. With these innovations, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple 3D vision-language grounding tasks, demonstrating the potential of transferring advances from 2D vision-language learning to the data-constrained 3D domain. Furthermore, co-training on both 2D and 3D data enhances performance across modalities without sacrificing 2D capabilities. By removing the reliance on 3D mesh reconstruction and ground-truth object proposals, UniVLG sets a new standard for realistic, embodied-aligned evaluation.

- **Summary**: In this work, we empirically study Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for text-to-image generation, focusing on architectural choices, text-conditioning strategies, and training protocols. We evaluate a range of DiT-based architectures--including PixArt-style and MMDiT variants--and compare them with a standard DiT variant which directly processes concatenated text and noise inputs. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that the performance of standard DiT is comparable with those specialized models, while demonstrating superior parameter-efficiency, especially when scaled up. Leveraging the layer-wise parameter sharing strategy, we achieve a further reduction of 66% in model size compared to an MMDiT architecture, with minimal performance impact. Building on an in-depth analysis of critical components such as text encoders and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), we introduce DiT-Air and DiT-Air-Lite. With supervised and reward fine-tuning, DiT-Air achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval and T2I CompBench, while DiT-Air-Lite remains highly competitive, surpassing most existing models despite its compact size.

- **Summary**: While large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, certain challenges require complex multi-step reasoning to reach accurate answers. One particularly challenging task is autonomous driving, which demands thorough cognitive processing before decisions can be made. In this domain, a sequential and interpretive understanding of visual cues is essential for effective perception, prediction, and planning. Nevertheless, common VQA benchmarks often focus on the accuracy of the final answer while overlooking the reasoning process that enables the generation of accurate responses. Moreover, existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating step-by-step reasoning in realistic driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DriveLMM-o1, a new dataset and benchmark specifically designed to advance step-wise visual reasoning for autonomous driving. Our benchmark features over 18k VQA examples in the training set and more than 4k in the test set, covering diverse questions on perception, prediction, and planning, each enriched with step-by-step reasoning to ensure logical inference in autonomous driving scenarios. We further introduce a large multimodal model that is fine-tuned on our reasoning dataset, demonstrating robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In addition, we benchmark various open-source and closed-source methods on our proposed dataset, systematically comparing their reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving tasks. Our model achieves a +7.49% gain in final answer accuracy, along with a 3.62% improvement in reasoning score over the previous best open-source model. Our framework, dataset, and model are available at https://github.com/ayesha-ishaq/DriveLMM-o1.

- **Summary**: Normalization layers are ubiquitous in modern neural networks and have long been considered essential. This work demonstrates that Transformers without normalization can achieve the same or better performance using a remarkably simple technique. We introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), an element-wise operation $DyT($x$) = \tanh(\alpha $x$)$, as a drop-in replacement for normalization layers in Transformers. DyT is inspired by the observation that layer normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, $S$-shaped input-output mappings. By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models. These findings challenge the conventional understanding that normalization layers are indispensable in modern neural networks, and offer new insights into their role in deep networks.

- **Summary**: Fitting a body to a 3D clothed human point cloud is a common yet challenging task. Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that are sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often struggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose Equivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface to the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%). Our equivariant tightness design can even reduce directional errors by (67.2% ~ 89.8%) in one-shot (or out-of-distribution) settings. Qualitative results demonstrate strong generalization of ETCH, regardless of challenging poses, unseen shapes, loose clothing, and non-rigid dynamics. We will release the code and models soon for research purposes at https://boqian-li.github.io/ETCH/.

- **Summary**: Animatable 3D human reconstruction from a single image is a challenging problem due to the ambiguity in decoupling geometry, appearance, and deformation. Recent advances in 3D human reconstruction mainly focus on static human modeling, and the reliance of using synthetic 3D scans for training limits their generalization ability. Conversely, optimization-based video methods achieve higher fidelity but demand controlled capture conditions and computationally intensive refinement processes. Motivated by the emergence of large reconstruction models for efficient static reconstruction, we propose LHM (Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model) to infer high-fidelity avatars represented as 3D Gaussian splatting in a feed-forward pass. Our model leverages a multimodal transformer architecture to effectively encode the human body positional features and image features with attention mechanism, enabling detailed preservation of clothing geometry and texture. To further boost the face identity preservation and fine detail recovery, we propose a head feature pyramid encoding scheme to aggregate multi-scale features of the head regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LHM generates plausible animatable human in seconds without post-processing for face and hands, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability.

- **Summary**: Acquiring physically plausible motor skills across diverse and unconventional morphologies-including humanoid robots, quadrupeds, and animals-is essential for advancing character simulation and robotics. Traditional methods, such as reinforcement learning (RL) are task- and body-specific, require extensive reward function engineering, and do not generalize well. Imitation learning offers an alternative but relies heavily on high-quality expert demonstrations, which are difficult to obtain for non-human morphologies. Video diffusion models, on the other hand, are capable of generating realistic videos of various morphologies, from humans to ants. Leveraging this capability, we propose a data-independent approach for skill acquisition that learns 3D motor skills from 2D-generated videos, with generalization capability to unconventional and non-human forms. Specifically, we guide the imitation learning process by leveraging vision transformers for video-based comparisons by calculating pair-wise distance between video embeddings. Along with video-encoding distance, we also use a computed similarity between segmented video frames as a guidance reward. We validate our method on locomotion tasks involving unique body configurations. In humanoid robot locomotion tasks, we demonstrate that 'No-data Imitation Learning' (NIL) outperforms baselines trained on 3D motion-capture data. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging generative video models for physically plausible skill learning with diverse morphologies, effectively replacing data collection with data generation for imitation learning.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) has enabled their application in scientific problem-solving, yet their fine-grained capabilities remain under-explored. In this paper, we introduce SciVerse, a multi-modal scientific evaluation benchmark to thoroughly assess LMMs across 5,735 test instances in five distinct versions. We aim to investigate three key dimensions of LMMs: scientific knowledge comprehension, multi-modal content interpretation, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. To unveil whether LMMs possess sufficient scientific expertise, we first transform each problem into three versions containing different levels of knowledge required for solving, i.e., Knowledge-free, -lite, and -rich. Then, to explore how LMMs interpret multi-modal scientific content, we annotate another two versions, i.e., Vision-rich and -only, marking more question information from texts to diagrams. Comparing the results of different versions, SciVerse systematically examines the professional knowledge stock and visual perception skills of LMMs in scientific domains. In addition, to rigorously assess CoT reasoning, we propose a new scientific CoT evaluation strategy, conducting a step-wise assessment on knowledge and logical errors in model outputs. Our extensive evaluation of different LMMs on SciVerse reveals critical limitations in their scientific proficiency and provides new insights into future developments.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges for vision models in critical fields like healthcare, where reliability is essential. Although adversarial training has been well studied in natural images, its application to biomedical and microscopy data remains limited. Existing self-supervised adversarial training methods overlook the hierarchical structure of histopathology images, where patient-slide-patch relationships provide valuable discriminative signals. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Adversarial Training (HSAT), which exploits these properties to craft adversarial examples using multi-level contrastive learning and integrate it into adversarial training for enhanced robustness. We evaluate HSAT on multiclass histopathology dataset OpenSRH and the results show that HSAT outperforms existing methods from both biomedical and natural image domains. HSAT enhances robustness, achieving an average gain of 54.31% in the white-box setting and reducing performance drops to 3-4% in the black-box setting, compared to 25-30% for the baseline. These results set a new benchmark for adversarial training in this domain, paving the way for more robust models. Our Code for training and evaluation is available at https://github.com/HashmatShadab/HSAT.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a general framework for universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation. Existing zero-shot methods build inference framework upon large language models (LLM) for specific tasks, which differs a lot in overall pipeline and fails to generalize across different types of goal. Towards the aim of universal zero-shot navigation, we propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals, including object category, instance image and text description. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks with a single model, even outperforming task-specific zero-shot methods and supervised universal methods.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models, enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing autoregressive VLA methods leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they disrupt the continuity of actions. Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on VLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single large language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the generation gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the diffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe, we find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these two predictions, leading to more robust control. In experiments, HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods across various simulation and real-world tasks, including both single-arm and dual-arm robots, while demonstrating stable manipulation in previously unseen configurations.

- **Summary**: Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are a remarkable innovation consisting of learnable activation functions with the potential to capture more complex relationships from data. Although KANs are useful in finding symbolic representations and continual learning of one-dimensional functions, their effectiveness in diverse machine learning (ML) tasks, such as vision, remains questionable. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep network architectures, including advanced architectures such as vision Transformers (ViTs). In this paper, we are the first to design a general learnable Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for vanilla ViTs that can operate on any choice of basis. However, the computing and memory costs of training them motivated us to propose a more modular version, and we designed particular learnable attention, called Fourier-KArAt. Fourier-KArAt and its variants either outperform their ViT counterparts or show comparable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets. We dissect these architectures' performance and generalization capacity by analyzing their loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer path, attention visualization, and spectral behavior, and contrast them with vanilla ViTs. The goal of this paper is not to produce parameter- and compute-efficient attention, but to encourage the community to explore KANs in conjunction with more advanced architectures that require a careful understanding of learnable activations.

- **Summary**: As there are now millions of publicly available neural networks, searching and analyzing large model repositories becomes increasingly important. Navigating so many models requires an atlas, but as most models are poorly documented charting such an atlas is challenging. To explore the hidden potential of model repositories, we chart a preliminary atlas representing the documented fraction of Hugging Face. It provides stunning visualizations of the model landscape and evolution. We demonstrate several applications of this atlas including predicting model attributes (e.g., accuracy), and analyzing trends in computer vision models. However, as the current atlas remains incomplete, we propose a method for charting undocumented regions. Specifically, we identify high-confidence structural priors based on dominant real-world model training practices. Leveraging these priors, our approach enables accurate mapping of previously undocumented areas of the atlas. We publicly release our datasets, code, and interactive atlas.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces V$^2$Edit, a novel training-free framework for instruction-guided video and 3D scene editing. Addressing the critical challenge of balancing original content preservation with editing task fulfillment, our approach employs a progressive strategy that decomposes complex editing tasks into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Each subtask is controlled through three key synergistic mechanisms: the initial noise, noise added at each denoising step, and cross-attention maps between text prompts and video content. This ensures robust preservation of original video elements while effectively applying the desired edits. Beyond its native video editing capability, we extend V$^2$Edit to 3D scene editing via a "render-edit-reconstruct" process, enabling high-quality, 3D-consistent edits even for tasks involving substantial geometric changes such as object insertion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our V$^2$Edit achieves high-quality and successful edits across various challenging video editing tasks and complex 3D scene editing tasks, thereby establishing state-of-the-art performance in both domains.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Despite promising performance on open-source large vision-language models (LVLMs), transfer-based targeted attacks often fail against black-box commercial LVLMs. Analyzing failed adversarial perturbations reveals that the learned perturbations typically originate from a uniform distribution and lack clear semantic details, resulting in unintended responses. This critical absence of semantic information leads commercial LVLMs to either ignore the perturbation entirely or misinterpret its embedded semantics, thereby causing the attack to fail. To overcome these issues, we notice that identifying core semantic objects is a key objective for models trained with various datasets and methodologies. This insight motivates our approach that refines semantic clarity by encoding explicit semantic details within local regions, thus ensuring interoperability and capturing finer-grained features, and by concentrating modifications on semantically rich areas rather than applying them uniformly. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet highly effective solution: at each optimization step, the adversarial image is cropped randomly by a controlled aspect ratio and scale, resized, and then aligned with the target image in the embedding space. Experimental results confirm our hypothesis. Our adversarial examples crafted with local-aggregated perturbations focused on crucial regions exhibit surprisingly good transferability to commercial LVLMs, including GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Claude-3.5-sonnet, Claude-3.7-sonnet, and even reasoning models like o1, Claude-3.7-thinking and Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking. Our approach achieves success rates exceeding 90% on GPT-4.5, 4o, and o1, significantly outperforming all prior state-of-the-art attack methods.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Minibatch optimal transport coupling straightens paths in unconditional flow matching. This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer integration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when numerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time. However, in the conditional setting, minibatch optimal transport falls short. This is because the default optimal transport mapping disregards conditions, resulting in a conditionally skewed prior distribution during training. In contrast, at test time, we have no access to the skewed prior, and instead sample from the full, unbiased prior distribution. This gap between training and testing leads to a subpar performance. To bridge this gap, we propose conditional optimal transport C^2OT that adds a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix when computing the optimal transport assignment. Experiments demonstrate that this simple fix works with both discrete and continuous conditions in 8gaussians-to-moons, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32x32, and ImageNet-256x256. Our method performs better overall compared to the existing baselines across different function evaluation budgets. Code is available at https://hkchengrex.github.io/C2OT

- **Summary**: Distilled diffusion models suffer from a critical limitation: reduced sample diversity compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we introduce Diffusion Target (DT) Visualization, an analysis and debugging tool that reveals how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through DT-Visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications.

- **Summary**: Classifier-free guidance has become a staple for conditional generation with denoising diffusion models. However, a comprehensive understanding of classifier-free guidance is still missing. In this work, we carry out an empirical study to provide a fresh perspective on classifier-free guidance. Concretely, instead of solely focusing on classifier-free guidance, we trace back to the root, i.e., classifier guidance, pinpoint the key assumption for the derivation, and conduct a systematic study to understand the role of the classifier. We find that both classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance achieve conditional generation by pushing the denoising diffusion trajectories away from decision boundaries, i.e., areas where conditional information is usually entangled and is hard to learn. Based on this classifier-centric understanding, we propose a generic postprocessing step built upon flow-matching to shrink the gap between the learned distribution for a pre-trained denoising diffusion model and the real data distribution, majorly around the decision boundaries. Experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Current image generation and editing methods primarily process textual prompts as direct inputs without reasoning about visual composition and explicit operations. We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation, allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image adjustments.

- **Summary**: Clothes-Changing Person Re-Identification (ReID) aims to recognize the same individual across different videos captured at various times and locations. This task is particularly challenging due to changes in appearance, such as clothing, hairstyle, and accessories. We propose a Clothes-Changing ReID method that uses only skeleton data and does not use appearance features. Traditional ReID methods often depend on appearance features, leading to decreased accuracy when clothing changes. Our approach utilizes a spatio-temporal Graph Convolution Network (GCN) encoder to generate a skeleton-based descriptor for each individual. During testing, we improve accuracy by aggregating predictions from multiple segments of a video clip. Evaluated on the CCVID dataset with several different pose estimation models, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a robust and efficient solution for Clothes-Changing ReID.

- **Summary**: Bridging different modalities lies at the heart of cross-modality generation. While conventional approaches treat the text modality as a conditioning signal that gradually guides the denoising process from Gaussian noise to the target image modality, we explore a much simpler paradigm-directly evolving between text and image modalities through flow matching. This requires projecting both modalities into a shared latent space, which poses a significant challenge due to their inherently different representations: text is highly semantic and encoded as 1D tokens, whereas images are spatially redundant and represented as 2D latent embeddings. To address this, we introduce FlowTok, a minimal framework that seamlessly flows across text and images by encoding images into a compact 1D token representation. Compared to prior methods, this design reduces the latent space size by 3.3x at an image resolution of 256, eliminating the need for complex conditioning mechanisms or noise scheduling. Moreover, FlowTok naturally extends to image-to-text generation under the same formulation. With its streamlined architecture centered around compact 1D tokens, FlowTok is highly memory-efficient, requires significantly fewer training resources, and achieves much faster sampling speeds-all while delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art models. Code will be available at https://github.com/bytedance/1d-tokenizer.

- **Summary**: Roadside vision centric 3D object detection has received increasing attention in recent years. It expands the perception range of autonomous vehicles, enhances the road safety. Previous methods focused on predicting per-pixel height rather than depth, making significant gains in roadside visual perception. While it is limited by the perspective property of near-large and far-small on image features, making it difficult for network to understand real dimension of objects in the 3D world. BEV features and voxel features present the real distribution of objects in 3D world compared to the image features. However, BEV features tend to lose details due to the lack of explicit height information, and voxel features are computationally expensive. Inspired by this insight, an efficient framework learning height prediction in voxel features via transformer is proposed, dubbed HeightFormer. It groups the voxel features into local height sequences, and utilize attention mechanism to obtain height distribution prediction. Subsequently, the local height sequences are reassembled to generate accurate 3D features. The proposed method is applied to two large-scale roadside benchmarks, DAIR-V2X-I and Rope3D. Extensive experiments are performed and the HeightFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in roadside vision centric 3D object detection task.

- **Summary**: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), trained on extensive datasets of image-text pairs, exhibit strong multimodal understanding capabilities by implicitly learning associations between textual descriptions and image regions. This emergent ability enables zero-shot object detection and segmentation, using techniques that rely on text-image attention maps, without necessarily training on abundant labeled segmentation datasets. However, performance of such methods depends heavily on prompt engineering and manually selected layers or head choices for the attention layers. In this work, we demonstrate that, rather than relying solely on textual prompts, providing a single visual example for each category and fine-tuning the text-to-image attention layers and embeddings significantly improves the performance. Additionally, we propose learning an ensemble through few-shot fine-tuning across multiple layers and/or prompts. An entropy-based ranking and selection mechanism for text-to-image attention layers is proposed to identify the top-performing layers without the need for segmentation labels. This eliminates the need for hyper-parameter selection of text-to-image attention layers, providing a more flexible and scalable solution for open-vocabulary segmentation. We show that this approach yields strong zero-shot performance, further enhanced through fine-tuning with a single visual example. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method and findings are general and can be applied across various vision-language models (VLMs).

- **Summary**: We propose a novel approach for captioning and object grounding in video, where the objects in the caption are grounded in the video via temporally dense bounding boxes. We introduce the following contributions. First, we present a large-scale automatic annotation method that aggregates captions grounded with bounding boxes across individual frames into temporally dense and consistent bounding box annotations. We apply this approach on the HowTo100M dataset to construct a large-scale pre-training dataset, named HowToGround1M. We also introduce a Grounded Video Caption Generation model, dubbed GROVE, and pre-train the model on HowToGround1M. Second, we introduce a new dataset, called iGround, of 3500 videos with manually annotated captions and dense spatio-temporally grounded bounding boxes. This allows us to measure progress on this challenging problem, as well as to fine-tune our model on this small-scale but high-quality data. Third, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the proposed iGround dataset compared to a number of baselines, as well as on the VidSTG and ActivityNet-Entities datasets. We perform extensive ablations that demonstrate the importance of pre-training using our automatically annotated HowToGround1M dataset followed by fine-tuning on the manually annotated iGround dataset and validate the key technical contributions of our model.

- **Summary**: Vector Quantization (VQ) techniques face significant challenges in codebook utilization, limiting reconstruction fidelity in image modeling. We introduce a Dual Codebook mechanism that effectively addresses this limitation by partitioning the representation into complementary global and local components. The global codebook employs a lightweight transformer for concurrent updates of all code vectors, while the local codebook maintains precise feature representation through deterministic selection. This complementary approach is trained from scratch without requiring pre-trained knowledge. Experimental evaluation across multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using a compact codebook of size 512 - half the size of previous methods that require pre-training. Our approach achieves significant FID improvements across diverse image domains, particularly excelling in scene and face reconstruction tasks. These results establish Dual Codebook VQ as an efficient paradigm for high-fidelity image reconstruction with significantly reduced computational requirements.

- **Summary**: Despite the promising results of large multimodal models (LMMs) in complex vision-language tasks that require knowledge, reasoning, and perception abilities together, we surprisingly found that these models struggle with simple tasks on infographics that require perception only. As existing benchmarks primarily focus on end tasks that require various abilities, they provide limited, fine-grained insights into the limitations of the models' perception abilities. To address this gap, we leverage the theory of graphical perception, an approach used to study how humans decode visual information encoded on charts and graphs, to develop an evaluation framework for analyzing gaps in LMMs' perception abilities in charts. With automated task generation and response evaluation designs, our framework enables comprehensive and controlled testing of LMMs' graphical perception across diverse chart types, visual elements, and task types. We apply our framework to evaluate and diagnose the perception capabilities of state-of-the-art LMMs at three granularity levels (chart, visual element, and pixel). Our findings underscore several critical limitations of current state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o: their inability to (1) generalize across chart types, (2) understand fundamental visual elements, and (3) cross reference values within a chart. These insights provide guidance for future improvements in perception abilities of LMMs. The evaluation framework and labeled data are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/lmm-graphical-perception.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose RI3D, a novel 3DGS-based approach that harnesses the power of diffusion models to reconstruct high-quality novel views given a sparse set of input images. Our key contribution is separating the view synthesis process into two tasks of reconstructing visible regions and hallucinating missing regions, and introducing two personalized diffusion models, each tailored to one of these tasks. Specifically, one model ('repair') takes a rendered image as input and predicts the corresponding high-quality image, which in turn is used as a pseudo ground truth image to constrain the optimization. The other model ('inpainting') primarily focuses on hallucinating details in unobserved areas. To integrate these models effectively, we introduce a two-stage optimization strategy: the first stage reconstructs visible areas using the repair model, and the second stage reconstructs missing regions with the inpainting model while ensuring coherence through further optimization. Moreover, we augment the optimization with a novel Gaussian initialization method that obtains per-image depth by combining 3D-consistent and smooth depth with highly detailed relative depth. We demonstrate that by separating the process into two tasks and addressing them with the repair and inpainting models, we produce results with detailed textures in both visible and missing regions that outperform state-of-the-art approaches on a diverse set of scenes with extremely sparse inputs.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive inference capabilities, but remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that can induce harmful or unethical responses. Existing defence methods are predominantly white-box approaches that require access to model parameters and extensive modifications, making them costly and impractical for many real-world scenarios. Although some black-box defences have been proposed, they often impose input constraints or require multiple queries, limiting their effectiveness in safety-critical tasks such as autonomous driving. To address these challenges, we propose a novel black-box defence framework called \textbf{T}extual \textbf{A}nchoring for \textbf{I}mmunizing \textbf{J}ailbreak \textbf{I}mages (\textbf{TAIJI}). TAIJI leverages key phrase-based textual anchoring to enhance the model's ability to assess and mitigate the harmful content embedded within both visual and textual prompts. Unlike existing methods, TAIJI operates effectively with a single query during inference, while preserving the VLM's performance on benign tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAIJI significantly enhances the safety and reliability of VLMs, providing a practical and efficient solution for real-world deployment.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel spatial attention module, that can be integrated to any convolutional network. This module guides the model to pay attention to the most discriminative part of an image. This enables the model to attain a better performance by an end-to-end training. In standard approaches, a spatial attention map is generated in a position-wise fashion. We observe that this results in very irregular boundaries. This could make it difficult to generalize to new samples. In our method, the attention region is constrained to be rectangular. This rectangle is parametrized by only 5 parameters, allowing for a better stability and generalization to new samples. In our experiments, our method systematically outperforms the position-wise counterpart. Thus, this provides us a novel useful spatial attention mechanism for convolutional models. Besides, our module also provides the interpretability concerning the ``where to look" question, as it helps to know the part of the input on which the model focuses to produce the prediction.

- **Summary**: In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.

- **Summary**: Motion prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, as it enables accurate forecasting of future vehicle trajectories based on historical inputs. This paper introduces Trajectory Mamba, a novel efficient trajectory prediction framework based on the selective state-space model (SSM). Conventional attention-based models face the challenge of computational costs that grow quadratically with the number of targets, hindering their application in highly dynamic environments. In response, we leverage the SSM to redesign the self-attention mechanism in the encoder-decoder architecture, thereby achieving linear time complexity. To address the potential reduction in prediction accuracy resulting from modifications to the attention mechanism, we propose a joint polyline encoding strategy to better capture the associations between static and dynamic contexts, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, to balance prediction accuracy and inference speed, we adopted the decoder that differs entirely from the encoder. Through cross-state space attention, all target agents share the scene context, allowing the SSM to interact with the shared scene representation during decoding, thus inferring different trajectories over the next prediction steps. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of inference speed and parameter efficiency on both the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets. It demonstrates a four-fold reduction in FLOPs compared to existing methods and reduces parameter count by over 40% while surpassing the performance of the vast majority of previous methods. These findings validate the effectiveness of Trajectory Mamba in trajectory prediction tasks.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have many potential medical imaging applications. Due to the limited memory of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), most current 3D GAN models are trained on low-resolution medical images, these models cannot scale to high-resolution or are susceptible to patchy artifacts. In this work, we propose an end-to-end novel GAN architecture that uses Conditional Random field (CRF) to model dependencies so that it can generate consistent 3D medical Images without exploiting memory. To achieve this purpose, the generator is divided into two parts during training, the first part produces an intermediate representation and CRF is applied to this intermediate representation to capture correlations. The second part of the generator produces a random sub-volume of image using a subset of the intermediate representation. This structure has two advantages: first, the correlations are modeled by using the features that the generator is trying to optimize. Second, the generator can generate full high-resolution images during inference. Experiments on Lung CTs and Brain MRIs show that our architecture outperforms state-of-the-art while it has lower memory usage and less complexity.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in reasoning, yet come with substantial computational cost, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Despite recent efforts on improving the efficiency of MLLMs, prior solutions fall short in responding to varying runtime conditions, in particular changing resource availability (e.g., contention due to the execution of other programs on the device). To bridge this gap, we introduce AdaLLaVA, an adaptive inference framework that learns to dynamically reconfigure operations in an MLLM during inference, accounting for the input data and a latency budget. We conduct extensive experiments across benchmarks involving question-answering, reasoning, and hallucination. Our results show that AdaLLaVA effectively adheres to input latency budget, achieving varying accuracy and latency tradeoffs at runtime. Further, we demonstrate that AdaLLaVA adapts to both input latency and content, can be integrated with token selection for enhanced efficiency, and generalizes across MLLMs.Our project webpage with code release is at https://zhuoyan-xu.github.io/ada-llava/.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become an integral part of our daily lives, especially in vision-related applications. However, the conventional lossy image compression algorithms are primarily designed for the Human Vision System (HVS), which can non-trivially compromise the DNNs' validation accuracy after compression, as noted in \cite{liu2018deepn}. Thus developing an image compression algorithm for both human and machine (DNNs) is on the horizon.   To address the challenge mentioned above, in this paper, we first formulate the image compression as a multi-objective optimization problem which take both human and machine prespectives into account, then we solve it by linear combination, and proposed a novel distortion measure for both human and machine, dubbed Human and Machine-Oriented Error (HMOE). After that, we develop Human And Machine Oriented Soft Decision Quantization (HMOSDQ) based on HMOE, a lossy image compression algorithm for both human and machine (DNNs), and fully complied with JPEG format. In order to evaluate the performance of HMOSDQ, finally we conduct the experiments for two pre-trained well-known DNN-based image classifiers named Alexnet \cite{Alexnet} and VGG-16 \cite{simonyan2014VGG} on two subsets of the ImageNet \cite{deng2009imagenet} validation set: one subset included images with shorter side in the range of 496 to 512, while the other included images with shorter side in the range of 376 to 384. Our results demonstrate that HMOSDQ outperforms the default JPEG algorithm in terms of rate-accuracy and rate-distortion performance. For the Alexnet comparing with the default JPEG algorithm, HMOSDQ can improve the validation accuracy by more than $0.81\%$ at $0.61$ BPP, or equivalently reduce the compression rate of default JPEG by $9.6\times$ while maintaining the same validation accuracy.

- **Summary**: The growing demand for detailed building roof data has driven the development of automated extraction methods to overcome the inefficiencies of traditional approaches, particularly in handling complex variations in building geometries. Re:PolyWorld, which integrates point detection with graph neural networks, presents a promising solution for reconstructing high-detail building roof vector data. This study enhances Re:PolyWorld's performance on complex urban residential structures by incorporating attention-based backbones and additional area segmentation loss. Despite dataset limitations, our experiments demonstrated improvements in point position accuracy (1.33 pixels) and line distance accuracy (14.39 pixels), along with a notable increase in the reconstruction score to 91.99%. These findings highlight the potential of advanced neural network architectures in addressing the challenges of complex urban residential geometries.

- **Summary**: Biometric recognition becomes increasingly challenging as we move away from the visible spectrum to infrared imagery, where domain discrepancies significantly impact identification performance. In this paper, we show that body embeddings perform better than face embeddings for cross-spectral person identification in medium-wave infrared (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) domains. Due to the lack of multi-domain datasets, previous research on cross-spectral body identification - also known as Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) - has primarily focused on individual infrared bands, such as near-infrared (NIR) or LWIR, separately. We address the multi-domain body recognition problem using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which enables matching of short-wave infrared (SWIR), MWIR, and LWIR images against RGB (VIS) images. We leverage a vision transformer architecture to establish benchmark results on the IJB-MDF dataset and, through extensive experiments, provide valuable insights into the interrelation of infrared domains, the adaptability of VIS-pretrained models, the role of local semantic features in body-embeddings, and effective training strategies for small datasets. Additionally, we show that finetuning a body model, pretrained exclusively on VIS data, with a simple combination of cross-entropy and triplet losses achieves state-of-the-art mAP scores on the LLCM dataset.

- **Summary**: Face Recognition Systems (FRS) are increasingly vulnerable to face-morphing attacks, prompting the development of Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) algorithms. However, a key challenge in MAD lies in its limited generalizability to unseen data and its lack of explainability-critical for practical application environments such as enrolment stations and automated border control systems. Recognizing that most existing MAD algorithms rely on supervised learning paradigms, this work explores a novel approach to MAD using zero-shot learning leveraged on Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose two types of zero-shot MAD algorithms: one leveraging general vision models and the other utilizing multimodal LLMs. For general vision models, we address the MAD task by computing the mean support embedding of an independent support set without using morphed images. For the LLM-based approach, we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 Turbo API with carefully crafted prompts. To evaluate the feasibility of zero-shot MAD and the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we constructed a print-scan morph dataset featuring various unseen morphing algorithms, simulating challenging real-world application scenarios. Experimental results demonstrated notable detection accuracy, validating the applicability of zero-shot learning for MAD tasks. Additionally, our investigation into LLM-based MAD revealed that multimodal LLMs, such as ChatGPT, exhibit remarkable generalizability to untrained MAD tasks. Furthermore, they possess a unique ability to provide explanations and guidance, which can enhance transparency and usability for end-users in practical applications.

- **Summary**: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and ensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy along computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning approaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for practical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast, simpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise classification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato classification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through transfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to address the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling real-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were deployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity classification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an average classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and auto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment metrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These results underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the accuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the way for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) models remain an emerging strategy to accelerate materials design and development. We demonstrate that convolutional neural network (CNN) models can characterize DNA origami nanostructures employed in programmable self-assembling, which is important in many applications such as in biomedicine. Specifically, we benchmark the performance of 9 CNN models -- viz. AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet152 -- to characterize the ligation number of DNA origami nanostructures in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. We first pre-train CNN models using a large image dataset of 720 images from our coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Then, we fine-tune the pre-trained CNN models, using a small experimental TEM dataset with 146 TEM images. All CNN models were found to have similar computational time requirements, while their model sizes and performances are different. We use 20 test MD images to demonstrate that among all of the pre-trained CNN models ResNet50 and VGG16 have the highest and second highest accuracies. Among the fine-tuned models, VGG16 was found to have the highest agreement on the test TEM images. Thus, we conclude that fine-tuned VGG16 models can quickly characterize the ligation number of nanostructures in large TEM images.

- **Summary**: We present OuroMamba, the first data-free post-training quantization (DFQ) method for vision Mamba-based models (VMMs). We identify two key challenges in enabling DFQ for VMMs, (1) VMM's recurrent state transitions restricts capturing of long-range interactions and leads to semantically weak synthetic data, (2) VMM activations exhibit dynamic outlier variations across time-steps, rendering existing static PTQ techniques ineffective. To address these challenges, OuroMamba presents a two-stage framework: (1) OuroMamba-Gen to generate semantically rich and meaningful synthetic data. It applies contrastive learning on patch level VMM features generated through neighborhood interactions in the latent state space, (2) OuroMamba-Quant to employ mixed-precision quantization with lightweight dynamic outlier detection during inference. In specific, we present a thresholding based outlier channel selection strategy for activations that gets updated every time-step. Extensive experiments across vision and generative tasks show that our data-free OuroMamba surpasses existing data-driven PTQ techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse quantization settings. Additionally, we implement efficient GPU kernels to achieve practical latency speedup of up to 2.36x. Code will be released soon.
