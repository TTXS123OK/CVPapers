- **Summary**: In our daily life, we often encounter objects that are fragile and can be damaged by excessive grasping force, such as fruits. For these objects, it is paramount to grasp gently -- not using the maximum amount of force possible, but rather the minimum amount of force necessary. This paper proposes using visual, tactile, and auditory signals to learn to grasp and regrasp objects stably and gently. Specifically, we use audio signals as an indicator of gentleness during the grasping, and then train end-to-end an action-conditional model from raw visuo-tactile inputs that predicts both the stability and the gentleness of future grasping candidates, thus allowing the selection and execution of the most promising action. Experimental results on a multi-fingered hand over 1,500 grasping trials demonstrated that our model is useful for gentle grasping by validating the predictive performance (3.27\% higher accuracy than the vision-only variant) and providing interpretations of their behavior. Finally, real-world experiments confirmed that the grasping performance with the trained multi-modal model outperformed other baselines (17\% higher rate for stable and gentle grasps than vision-only). Our approach requires neither tactile sensor calibration nor analytical force modeling, drastically reducing the engineering effort to grasp fragile objects.

- **Summary**: Lymph node (LN) assessment is an essential task in the routine radiology workflow, providing valuable insights for cancer staging, treatment planning and beyond. Identifying scatteredly-distributed and low-contrast LNs in 3D CT scans is highly challenging, even for experienced clinicians. Previous lesion and LN detection methods demonstrate effectiveness of 2.5D approaches (i.e, using 2D network with multi-slice inputs), leveraging pretrained 2D model weights and showing improved accuracy as compared to separate 2D or 3D detectors. However, slice-based 2.5D detectors do not explicitly model inter-slice consistency for LN as a 3D object, requiring heuristic post-merging steps to generate final 3D LN instances, which can involve tuning a set of parameters for each dataset. In this work, we formulate 3D LN detection as a tracking task and propose LN-Tracker, a novel LN tracking transformer, for joint end-to-end detection and 3D instance association. Built upon DETR-based detector, LN-Tracker decouples transformer decoder's query into the track and detection groups, where the track query autoregressively follows previously tracked LN instances along the z-axis of a CT scan. We design a new transformer decoder with masked attention module to align track query's content to the context of current slice, meanwhile preserving detection query's high accuracy in current slice. An inter-slice similarity loss is introduced to encourage cohesive LN association between slices. Extensive evaluation on four lymph node datasets shows LN-Tracker's superior performance, with at least 2.7% gain in average sensitivity when compared to other top 3D/2.5D detectors. Further validation on public lung nodule and prostate tumor detection tasks confirms the generalizability of LN-Tracker as it achieves top performance on both tasks. Datasets will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: While deep generative models have significantly advanced representation learning, they may inherit or amplify biases and fairness issues by encoding sensitive attributes alongside predictive features. Enforcing strict independence in disentanglement is often unrealistic when target and sensitive factors are naturally correlated. To address this challenge, we propose CAD-VAE (Correlation-Aware Disentangled VAE), which introduces a correlated latent code to capture the shared information between target and sensitive attributes. Given this correlated latent, our method effectively separates overlapping factors without extra domain knowledge by directly minimizing the conditional mutual information between target and sensitive codes. A relevance-driven optimization strategy refines the correlated code by efficiently capturing essential correlated features and eliminating redundancy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAD-VAE produces fairer representations, realistic counterfactuals, and improved fairness-aware image editing.

- **Summary**: This paper explores vision-based localization through a biologically-inspired approach that mirrors how humans and animals link views or perspectives when navigating their world. We introduce two sequential generative models, VAE-RNN and VAE-Transformer, which transform first-person perspective (FPP) observations into global map perspective (GMP) representations and precise geographical coordinates. Unlike retrieval-based methods, our approach frames localization as a generative task, learning direct mappings between perspectives without relying on dense satellite image databases. We evaluate these models across two real-world environments: a university campus navigated by a Jackal robot and an urban downtown area navigated by a Tesla sedan. The VAE-Transformer achieves impressive precision, with median deviations of 2.29m (1.37% of environment size) and 4.45m (0.35% of environment size) respectively, outperforming both VAE-RNN and prior cross-view geo-localization approaches. Our comprehensive Localization Performance Characteristics (LPC) analysis demonstrates superior performance with the VAE-Transformer achieving an AUC of 0.777 compared to 0.295 for VIGOR 200 and 0.225 for TransGeo, establishing a new state-of-the-art in vision-based localization. In some scenarios, our vision-based system rivals commercial smartphone GPS accuracy (AUC of 0.797) while requiring 5x less GPU memory and delivering 3x faster inference than existing methods in cross-view geo-localization. These results demonstrate that models inspired by biological spatial navigation can effectively memorize complex, dynamic environments and provide precise localization with minimal computational resources.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning-based point cloud registration have improved generalization, yet most methods still require retraining or manual parameter tuning for each new environment. In this paper, we identify three key factors limiting generalization: (a) reliance on environment-specific voxel size and search radius, (b) poor out-of-domain robustness of learning-based keypoint detectors, and (c) raw coordinate usage, which exacerbates scale discrepancies. To address these issues, we present a zero-shot registration pipeline called BUFFER-X by (a) adaptively determining voxel size/search radii, (b) using farthest point sampling to bypass learned detectors, and (c) leveraging patch-wise scale normalization for consistent coordinate bounds. In particular, we present a multi-scale patch-based descriptor generation and a hierarchical inlier search across scales to improve robustness in diverse scenes. We also propose a novel generalizability benchmark using 11 datasets that cover various indoor/outdoor scenarios and sensor modalities, demonstrating that BUFFER-X achieves substantial generalization without prior information or manual parameter tuning for the test datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new method for anomaly detection in automated systems with time and compute sensitive requirements, such as autonomous driving, with unparalleled efficiency. As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

- **Summary**: Multimodal sentiment analysis enhances conventional sentiment analysis, which traditionally relies solely on text, by incorporating information from different modalities such as images, text, and audio. This paper proposes a novel multimodal sentiment analysis architecture that integrates text and image data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of sentiments. For text feature extraction, we utilize BERT, a natural language processing model. For image feature extraction, we employ DINOv2, a vision-transformer-based model. The textual and visual latent features are integrated using proposed fusion techniques, namely the Basic Fusion Model, Self Attention Fusion Model, and Dual Attention Fusion Model. Experiments on three datasets, Memotion 7k dataset, MVSA single dataset, and MVSA multi dataset, demonstrate the viability and practicality of the proposed multimodal architecture.

- **Summary**: Real-time rendering of dynamic scenes with view-dependent effects remains a fundamental challenge in computer graphics. While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have shown promising results separately handling dynamic scenes (4DGS) and view-dependent effects (6DGS), no existing method unifies these capabilities while maintaining real-time performance. We present 7D Gaussian Splatting (7DGS), a unified framework representing scene elements as seven-dimensional Gaussians spanning position (3D), time (1D), and viewing direction (3D). Our key contribution is an efficient conditional slicing mechanism that transforms 7D Gaussians into view- and time-conditioned 3D Gaussians, maintaining compatibility with existing 3D Gaussian Splatting pipelines while enabling joint optimization. Experiments demonstrate that 7DGS outperforms prior methods by up to 7.36 dB in PSNR while achieving real-time rendering (401 FPS) on challenging dynamic scenes with complex view-dependent effects.

- **Summary**: The performance of traditional text-image person retrieval task is easily affected by lighting variations due to imaging limitations of visible spectrum sensors. In this work, we design a novel task called text-RGBT person retrieval that integrates complementary benefits from thermal and visible modalities for robust person retrieval in challenging environments. Aligning text and multi-modal visual representations is the key issue in text-RGBT person retrieval, but the heterogeneity between visible and thermal modalities may interfere with the alignment of visual and text modalities. To handle this problem, we propose a Multi-level Global-local cross-modal Alignment Network (MGANet), which sufficiently mines the relationships between modality-specific and modality-collaborative visual with the text, for text-RGBT person retrieval. To promote the research and development of this field, we create a high-quality text-RGBT person retrieval dataset, RGBT-PEDES. RGBT-PEDES contains 1,822 identities from different age groups and genders with 4,723 pairs of calibrated RGB and thermal images, and covers high-diverse scenes from both daytime and nighttime with a various of challenges such as occlusion, weak alignment and adverse lighting conditions. Additionally, we carefully annotate 7,987 fine-grained textual descriptions for all RGBT person image pairs. Extensive experiments on RGBT-PEDES demonstrate that our method outperforms existing text-image person retrieval methods. The code and dataset will be released upon the acceptance.

- **Summary**: A prior map serves as a foundational reference for localization in context-aware applications such as augmented reality (AR). Providing valuable contextual information about the environment, the prior map is a vital tool for mitigating drift. In this paper, we propose a map-based visual-inertial localization algorithm (NeRF-VIO) with initialization using neural radiance fields (NeRF). Our algorithm utilizes a multilayer perceptron model and redefines the loss function as the geodesic distance on \(SE(3)\), ensuring the invariance of the initialization model under a frame change within \(\mathfrak{se}(3)\). The evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms existing NeRF-based initialization solution in both accuracy and efficiency. By integrating a two-stage update mechanism within a multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework, the state of NeRF-VIO is constrained by both captured images from an onboard camera and rendered images from a pre-trained NeRF model. The proposed algorithm is validated using a real-world AR dataset, the results indicate that our two-stage update pipeline outperforms MSCKF across all data sequences.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the critical problem of representation similarity evolution during cross-domain transfer learning, with particular focus on understanding why pre-trained models maintain effectiveness when adapted to medical imaging tasks despite significant domain gaps. The study establishes a rigorous problem definition centered on quantifying and analyzing representation similarity trajectories throughout the fine-tuning process, while carefully delineating the scope to encompass both medical image analysis and broader cross-domain adaptation scenarios. Our empirical findings reveal three critical discoveries: the potential existence of high-performance models that preserve both task accuracy and representation similarity to their pre-trained origins; a robust linear correlation between layer-wise similarity metrics and representation quality indicators; and distinct adaptation patterns that differentiate supervised versus self-supervised pre-training paradigms. The proposed similarity space framework not only provides mechanistic insights into knowledge transfer dynamics but also raises fundamental questions about optimal utilization of pre-trained models. These results advance our understanding of neural network adaptation processes while offering practical implications for transfer learning strategies that extend beyond medical imaging applications. The code will be available once accepted.

  Track2 Competition
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: With the advent of deep learning, expression recognition has made significant advancements. However, due to the limited availability of annotated compound expression datasets and the subtle variations of compound expressions, Compound Emotion Recognition (CE) still holds considerable potential for exploration. To advance this task, the 7th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition introduces the Compound Expression Challenge based on C-EXPR-DB, a limited dataset without labels. In this paper, we present a curriculum learning-based framework that initially trains the model on single-expression tasks and subsequently incorporates multi-expression data. This design ensures that our model first masters the fundamental features of basic expressions before being exposed to the complexities of compound emotions. Specifically, our designs can be summarized as follows: 1) Single-Expression Pre-training: The model is first trained on datasets containing single expressions to learn the foundational facial features associated with basic emotions. 2) Dynamic Compound Expression Generation: Given the scarcity of annotated compound expression datasets, we employ CutMix and Mixup techniques on the original single-expression images to create hybrid images exhibiting characteristics of multiple basic emotions. 3) Incremental Multi-Expression Integration: After performing well on single-expression tasks, the model is progressively exposed to multi-expression data, allowing the model to adapt to the complexity and variability of compound expressions. The official results indicate that our method achieves the \textbf{best} performance in this competition track with an F-score of 0.6063. Our code is released at https://github.com/YenanLiu/ABAW7th.

- **Summary**: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes progressively while preserving knowledge of previously learned ones. Recent advances in this field have shifted towards parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, with many approaches building upon the framework that maintains a pool of learnable prompts. Although effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, primarily due to prompt pool querying and increased input sequence lengths from prompt concatenation. In this work, we present a novel prompt-based approach that addresses this limitation. Our method trains a single set of shared prompts across all tasks and, rather than concatenating prompts to the input, directly modifies the CLS token's attention computation by adding the prompts to it. This simple and lightweight design not only significantly reduces computational complexity-both in terms of inference costs and the number of trainable parameters-but also eliminates the need to optimize prompt lengths for different downstream tasks, offering a more efficient yet powerful solution for rehearsal-free class-incremental learning. Extensive experiments across a diverse range of CIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to establish a new prompt-based CIL paradigm. Furthermore, experiments on general recognition benchmarks beyond the CIL setting also show strong performance, positioning our method as a promising candidate for a general parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach.



### DiffEGG: Diffusion-Driven Edge Generation as a Pixel-Annotation-Free Alternative for Instance Annotation

- **Summary**: Achieving precise panoptic segmentation relies on pixel-wise instance annotations, but obtaining such datasets is costly. Unsupervised instance segmentation (UIS) eliminates annotation requirements but struggles with adjacent instance merging and single-instance fragmentation, largely due to the limitations of DINO-based backbones which lack strong instance separation cues. Weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation (WPS) reduces annotation costs using sparse labels (e.g., points, boxes), yet these annotations remain expensive and introduce human bias and boundary errors. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEGG (Diffusion-Driven EdGe Generation), a fully annotation-free method that extracts instance-aware features from pretrained diffusion models to generate precise instance edge maps. Unlike DINO-based UIS methods, diffusion models inherently capture fine-grained, instance-aware features, enabling more precise boundary delineation. For WPS, DiffEGG eliminates annotation costs and human bias by operating without any form of manual supervision, addressing the key limitations of prior best methods. Additionally, we introduce RIP, a post-processing technique that fuses DiffEGG's edge maps with segmentation masks in a task-agnostic manner. RIP allows DiffEGG to be seamlessly integrated into various segmentation frameworks. When applied to UIS, DiffEGG and RIP achieve an average $+4.4\text{ AP}$ improvement over prior best UIS methods. When combined with weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSS), DiffEGG enables WPS without instance annotations, outperforming prior best point-supervised WPS methods by $+1.7\text{ PQ}$. These results demonstrate that DiffEGG's edge maps serve as a cost-effective, annotation-free alternative to instance annotations, significantly improving segmentation without human intervention.

- **Summary**: Huge amount of data is the key of the success of deep learning, however, redundant information impairs the generalization ability of the model and increases the burden of calculation. Dataset Distillation (DD) compresses the original dataset into a smaller but representative subset for high-quality data and efficient training strategies. Existing works for DD generate synthetic images by treating each image as an independent entity, thereby overlooking the common features among data. This paper proposes a dataset distillation method based on Matching Training Trajectories with Low-rank Space Sampling(MTT-LSS), which uses low-rank approximations to capture multiple low-dimensional manifold subspaces of the original data. The synthetic data is represented by basis vectors and shared dimension mappers from these subspaces, reducing the cost of generating individual data points while effectively minimizing information redundancy. The proposed method is tested on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets, and outperforms the baseline methods by an average of 9.9%.

- **Summary**: 3D object reconstruction from single-view image is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications. Recent advancements in Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) have shown great promise in leveraging multi-view images generated by 2D diffusion models to extract 3D content. However, challenges remain as 2D diffusion models often struggle to produce dense images with strong multi-view consistency, and LRMs tend to amplify these inconsistencies during the 3D reconstruction process. Addressing these issues is critical for achieving high-quality and efficient 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we present CDI3D, a feed-forward framework designed for efficient, high-quality image-to-3D generation with view interpolation. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose to integrate 2D diffusion-based view interpolation into the LRM pipeline to enhance the quality and consistency of the generated mesh. Specifically, our approach introduces a Dense View Interpolation (DVI) module, which synthesizes interpolated images between main views generated by the 2D diffusion model, effectively densifying the input views with better multi-view consistency. We also design a tilt camera pose trajectory to capture views with different elevations and perspectives. Subsequently, we employ a tri-plane-based mesh reconstruction strategy to extract robust tokens from these interpolated and original views, enabling the generation of high-quality 3D meshes with superior texture and geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches across various benchmarks, producing 3D content with enhanced texture fidelity and geometric accuracy.

- **Summary**: Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a transformative technology that leverages ubiquitous wireless signals to enable a variety of applications ranging from activity and gesture recognition to indoor localization and health monitoring. However, the inherent dependency of Wi-Fi signals on environmental conditions introduces significant generalization challenges,variations in surroundings, human positions, and orientations often lead to inconsistent signal features, impeding robust action recognition. In this survey, we review over 200 studies on Wi-Fi sensing generalization, categorizing them along the entire sensing pipeline: device deployment, signal processing, feature learning, and model deployment. We systematically analyze state-of-the-art techniques, which are employed to mitigate the adverse effects of environmental variability. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive overview of open-source datasets such as Widar3.0, XRF55, and XRFv2, highlighting their unique characteristics and applicability for multimodal fusion and cross-modal tasks. Finally, we discuss emerging research directions, such as multimodal approaches and the integration of large language models,to inspire future advancements in this rapidly evolving field. Our survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, offering insights into current methodologies, available datasets, and promising avenues for further investigation.

- **Summary**: We present SKALD, a multi-shot video assembly method that constructs coherent video sequences from candidate shots with minimal reliance on text. Central to our approach is the Learned Clip Assembly (LCA) score, a learning-based metric that measures temporal and semantic relationships between shots to quantify narrative coherence. We tackle the exponential complexity of combining multiple shots with an efficient beam-search algorithm guided by the LCA score. To train our model effectively with limited human annotations, we propose two tasks for the LCA encoder: Shot Coherence Learning, which uses contrastive learning to distinguish coherent and incoherent sequences, and Feature Regression, which converts these learned representations into a real-valued coherence score. We develop two variants: a base SKALD model that relies solely on visual coherence and SKALD-text, which integrates auxiliary text information when available. Experiments on the VSPD and our curated MSV3C datasets show that SKALD achieves an improvement of up to 48.6% in IoU and a 43% speedup over the state-of-the-art methods. A user study further validates our approach, with 45% of participants favoring SKALD-assembled videos, compared to 22% preferring text-based assembly methods.

- **Summary**: We investigate bias trends in text-to-image generative models over time, focusing on the increasing availability of models through open platforms like Hugging Face. While these platforms democratize AI, they also facilitate the spread of inherently biased models, often shaped by task-specific fine-tuning. Ensuring ethical and transparent AI deployment requires robust evaluation frameworks and quantifiable bias metrics. To this end, we assess bias across three key dimensions: (i) distribution bias, (ii) generative hallucination, and (iii) generative miss-rate. Analyzing over 100 models, we reveal how bias patterns evolve over time and across generative tasks. Our findings indicate that artistic and style-transferred models exhibit significant bias, whereas foundation models, benefiting from broader training distributions, are becoming progressively less biased. By identifying these systemic trends, we contribute a large-scale evaluation corpus to inform bias research and mitigation strategies, fostering more responsible AI development.

- **Summary**: Predicting pedestrian trajectories is essential for autonomous driving systems, as it significantly enhances safety and supports informed decision-making. Accurate predictions enable the prevention of collisions, anticipation of crossing intent, and improved overall system efficiency. In this study, we present SGNetPose+, an enhancement of the SGNet architecture designed to integrate skeleton information or body segment angles with bounding boxes to predict pedestrian trajectories from video data to avoid hazards in autonomous driving. Skeleton information was extracted using a pose estimation model, and joint angles were computed based on the extracted joint data. We also apply temporal data augmentation by horizontally flipping video frames to increase the dataset size and improve performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the JAAD and PIE datasets using pose data with the bounding boxes, outperforming the SGNet model. Code is available on Github: SGNetPose+.

- **Summary**: In recent years, partial differential equation (PDE) systems have been successfully applied to the binarization of text images, achieving promising results. Inspired by the DH model and incorporating a novel image modeling approach, this study proposes a new weakly coupled PDE system for degraded text image binarization. In this system, the first equation is designed to estimate the background component, incorporating both diffusion and fidelity terms. The second equation estimates the foreground component and includes diffusion, fidelity, and binarization source terms. The final binarization result is obtained by applying a hard projection to the estimated foreground component. Experimental results on 86 degraded text images demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits significant advantages in handling degraded text images.

- **Summary**: As the computational needs of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) increase, visual token pruning has proven effective in improving inference speed and memory efficiency. Traditional pruning methods in LVLMs predominantly focus on attention scores to determine token relevance, overlooking critical aspects such as spatial position and token similarity. To this end, we introduce AdaptPrune, a novel plug-and-play training-free pruning method that builds on conventional attention-based pruning by integrating spatial distance and token similarity with an adaptive NMS approach. Our method is based on several observed phenomena in large models: the positional bias in the model's image attention and the redundancy of token information ignored by previous approaches. By integrating attention, spatial, and similarity information, our approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation of token importance and substantially refines the pruning decisions. Our method has been extensively tested across various LVLMs and benchmarks, confirming its robustness and adaptability. The results demonstrate that AdaptPrune consistently outperforms existing methods across various pruning ratios. Code is available at https://github.com/bzluan/AdaptPrune.

- **Summary**: The ability of the deep learning model to recognize when a sample falls outside its learned distribution is critical for safe and reliable deployment. Recent state-of-the-art out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods leverage activation shaping to improve the separation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD inputs. These approaches resort to sample-specific scaling but apply a static percentile threshold across all samples regardless of their nature, resulting in suboptimal ID-OOD separability. In this work, we propose \textbf{AdaSCALE}, an adaptive scaling procedure that dynamically adjusts the percentile threshold based on a sample's estimated OOD likelihood. This estimation leverages our key observation: OOD samples exhibit significantly more pronounced activation shifts at high-magnitude activations under minor perturbation compared to ID samples. AdaSCALE enables stronger scaling for likely ID samples and weaker scaling for likely OOD samples, yielding highly separable energy scores. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance, outperforming the latest rival OptFS by 14.94 in near-OOD and 21.67 in far-OOD datasets in average FPR@95 metric on the ImageNet-1k benchmark across eight diverse architectures.

- **Summary**: The reconstruction of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images from noisy projection data is a significant but challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised learning approach, Non-negative Implicit Neural Representation Factorization (\texttt{NINRF}), based on low rank matrix factorization of unknown images and employing neural networks to represent both coefficients and bases. Mathematically, we demonstrate that if a sequence of dynamic PET images satisfies a generalized non-negative low-rank property, it can be decomposed into a set of non-negative continuous functions varying in the temporal-spatial domain. This bridges the well-established non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with continuous functions and we propose using implicit neural representations (INRs) to connect matrix with continuous functions. The neural network parameters are obtained by minimizing the KL divergence, with additional sparsity regularization on coefficients and bases. Extensive experiments on dynamic PET reconstruction with Poisson noise demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other methods, while giving continuous representations for object's detailed geometric features and regional concentration variation.

- **Summary**: Due to numerous hardware shortcomings, medical image acquisition devices are susceptible to producing low-quality (i.e., low contrast, inappropriate brightness, noisy, etc.) images. Regrettably, perceptually degraded images directly impact the diagnosis process and make the decision-making manoeuvre of medical practitioners notably complicated. This study proposes to enhance such low-quality images by incorporating end-to-end learning strategies for accelerating medical image analysis tasks. To the best concern, this is the first work in medical imaging which comprehensively tackles perceptual enhancement, including contrast correction, luminance correction, denoising, etc., with a fully convolutional deep network. The proposed network leverages residual blocks and a residual gating mechanism for diminishing visual artefacts and is guided by a multi-term objective function to perceive the perceptually plausible enhanced images. The practicability of the deep medical image enhancement method has been extensively investigated with sophisticated experiments. The experimental outcomes illustrate that the proposed method could outperform the existing enhancement methods for different medical image modalities by 5.00 to 7.00 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics and 4.00 to 6.00 in DeltaE metrics. Additionally, the proposed method can drastically improve the medical image analysis tasks' performance and reveal the potentiality of such an enhancement method in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Flow Matching and Transformer architectures have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation tasks, with recent work FlowAR [Ren et al., 2024] synergistically integrating both paradigms to advance synthesis fidelity. However, current FlowAR implementations remain constrained by first-order trajectory modeling during the generation process. This paper introduces a novel framework that systematically enhances flow autoregressive transformers through high-order supervision. We provide theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation showing that our High-Order FlowAR (HOFAR) demonstrates measurable improvements in generation quality compared to baseline models. The proposed approach advances the understanding of flow-based autoregressive modeling by introducing a systematic framework for analyzing trajectory dynamics through high-order expansion.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Simple as it seems, moving an object to another location within an image is, in fact, a challenging image-editing task that requires re-harmonizing the lighting, adjusting the pose based on perspective, accurately filling occluded regions, and ensuring coherent synchronization of shadows and reflections while maintaining the object identity. In this paper, we present ObjectMover, a generative model that can perform object movement in highly challenging scenes. Our key insight is that we model this task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and fine-tune a video generation model to leverage its knowledge of consistent object generation across video frames. We show that with this approach, our model is able to adjust to complex real-world scenarios, handling extreme lighting harmonization and object effect movement. As large-scale data for object movement are unavailable, we construct a data generation pipeline using a modern game engine to synthesize high-quality data pairs. We further propose a multi-task learning strategy that enables training on real-world video data to improve the model generalization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ObjectMover achieves outstanding results and adapts well to real-world scenarios.

  Loss". arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2305.13948

- **Summary**: In this paper, we delve deeper into the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence loss and mathematically prove that it is equivalent to the Decoupled Kullback-Leibler (DKL) Divergence loss that consists of (1) a weighted Mean Square Error (wMSE) loss and (2) a Cross-Entropy loss incorporating soft labels. Thanks to the decoupled structure of DKL loss, we have identified two areas for improvement. Firstly, we address the limitation of KL loss in scenarios like knowledge distillation by breaking its asymmetric optimization property along with a smoother weight function. This modification effectively alleviates convergence challenges in optimization, particularly for classes with high predicted scores in soft labels. Secondly, we introduce class-wise global information into KL/DKL to reduce bias arising from individual samples. With these two enhancements, we derive the Generalized Kullback-Leibler (GKL) Divergence loss and evaluate its effectiveness by conducting experiments on CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and vision-language datasets, focusing on adversarial training, and knowledge distillation tasks. Specifically, we achieve new state-of-the-art adversarial robustness on the public leaderboard -- RobustBench and competitive knowledge distillation performance across CIFAR/ImageNet models and CLIP models, demonstrating the substantial practical merits.

- **Summary**: Low-level texture feature/knowledge is also of vital importance for characterizing the local structural pattern and global statistical properties, such as boundary, smoothness, regularity, and color contrast, which may not be well addressed by high-level deep features. In this paper, we aim to re-emphasize the low-level texture information in deep networks for semantic segmentation and related knowledge distillation tasks. To this end, we take full advantage of both structural and statistical texture knowledge and propose a novel Structural and Statistical Texture Knowledge Distillation (SSTKD) framework for semantic segmentation. Specifically, Contourlet Decomposition Module (CDM) is introduced to decompose the low-level features with iterative Laplacian pyramid and directional filter bank to mine the structural texture knowledge, and Texture Intensity Equalization Module (TIEM) is designed to extract and enhance the statistical texture knowledge with the corresponding Quantization Congruence Loss (QDL). Moreover, we propose the Co-occurrence TIEM (C-TIEM) and generic segmentation frameworks, namely STLNet++ and U-SSNet, to enable existing segmentation networks to harvest the structural and statistical texture information more effectively. Extensive experimental results on three segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and their state-of-the-art performance on seven popular benchmark datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Recently, Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-Training (ProLIP) has been proposed to tackle the multiplicity issue of vision-language (VL) tasks. Despite their success in probabilistic representation learning at a scale, the ProLIP models cannot handle long context texts longer than 64 context length, which limits their ability to capture rich contextual information from longer text sequences. To address this issue, this paper proposes a fine-tuning strategy for ProLIP to accept longer texts, e.g., 256 text tokens. Experimental results on Urban-1k and the DataComp evaluation suite show that the proposed LongProLIP recipe can improve understanding of long contexts while minimizing the negative effect of fine-tuning. We also observe a trade-off between the long context understanding (measured by Urban-1k) and general zero-shot capability (measured by ImageNet or the average of 38 zero-shot evaluation datasets by DataComp).

- **Summary**: The widespread use of deep learning classifiers necessitates Open-set recognition (OSR), which enables the identification of input data not only from classes known during training but also from unknown classes that might be present in test data. Many existing OSR methods are computationally expensive due to the reliance on complex generative models or suffer from high training costs. We investigate OSR from a representation-learning perspective, specifically through spherical embeddings. We introduce SphOR, a computationally efficient representation learning method that models the feature space as a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions. This approach enables the use of semantically ambiguous samples during training, to improve the detection of samples from unknown classes. We further explore the relationship between OSR performance and key representation learning properties which influence how well features are structured in high-dimensional space. Extensive experiments on multiple OSR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, producing state-of-the-art results, with improvements up-to 6% that validate its performance.

- **Summary**: Facial forgery methods such as deepfakes can be misused for identity manipulation and spreading misinformation. They have evolved alongside advancements in generative AI, leading to new and more sophisticated forgery techniques that diverge from existing 'known' methods. Conventional deepfake detection methods use the closedset paradigm, thus limiting their applicability to detecting forgeries created using methods that are not part of the training dataset. In this paper, we propose a shift from the closed-set paradigm for deepfake detection. In the open-set paradigm, models are designed not only to identify images created by known facial forgery methods but also to identify and flag those produced by previously unknown methods as 'unknown' and not as unforged/real/unmanipulated. In this paper, we propose an open-set deepfake classification algorithm based on supervised contrastive learning. The open-set paradigm used in our model allows it to function as a more robust tool capable of handling emerging and unseen deepfake techniques, enhancing reliability and confidence, and complementing forensic analysis. In open-set paradigm, we identify three groups including the "unknown group that is neither considered known deepfake nor real. We investigate deepfake open-set classification across three scenarios, classifying deepfakes from unknown methods not as real, distinguishing real images from deepfakes, and classifying deepfakes from known methods, using the FaceForensics++ dataset as a benchmark. Our method achieves state of the art results in the first two tasks and competitive results in the third task.

- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts can seriously affect clinical diagnostics, making it challenging to interpret images accurately. Existing methods for eliminating motion artifacts struggle to retain fine structural details and simultaneously lack the necessary vividness and sharpness. In this study, we present a novel dual-domain optimization (DDO) approach that integrates information from the pixel and frequency domains guiding the recovery of clean magnetic resonance images through implicit neural representations(INRs). Specifically, our approach leverages the low-frequency components in the k-space as a reference to capture accurate tissue textures, while high-frequency and pixel information contribute to recover details. Furthermore, we design complementary masks and dynamic loss weighting transitioning from global to local attention that effectively suppress artifacts while retaining useful details for reconstruction. Experimental results on the NYU fastMRI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in multiple evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Continual learning aims to learn knowledge of tasks observed in sequential time steps while mitigating the forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Existing methods were proposed under the assumption of learning a single modality (e.g., image) over time, which limits their applicability in scenarios involving multiple modalities. In this work, we propose a novel continual learning framework that accommodates multiple modalities (image, video, audio, depth, and text). We train a model to align various modalities with text, leveraging its rich semantic information. However, this increases the risk of forgetting previously learned knowledge, exacerbated by the differing input traits of each task. To alleviate the overwriting of the previous knowledge of modalities, we propose a method for aggregating knowledge within and across modalities. The aggregated knowledge is obtained by assimilating new information through self-regularization within each modality and associating knowledge between modalities by prioritizing contributions from relevant modalities. Furthermore, we propose a strategy that re-aligns the embeddings of modalities to resolve biased alignment between modalities. We evaluate the proposed method in a wide range of continual learning scenarios using multiple datasets with different modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ours outperforms existing methods in the scenarios, regardless of whether the identity of the modality is given.

- **Summary**: Low-cost millimeter automotive radar has received more and more attention due to its ability to handle adverse weather and lighting conditions in autonomous driving. However, the lack of quality datasets hinders research and development. We report a new method that is able to simulate 4D millimeter wave radar signals including pitch, yaw, range, and Doppler velocity along with radar signal strength (RSS) using camera image, light detection and ranging (lidar) point cloud, and ego-velocity. The method is based on two new neural networks: 1) DIS-Net, which estimates the spatial distribution and number of radar signals, and 2) RSS-Net, which predicts the RSS of the signal based on appearance and geometric information. We have implemented and tested our method using open datasets from 3 different models of commercial automotive radar. The experimental results show that our method can successfully generate high-fidelity radar signals. Moreover, we have trained a popular object detection neural network with data augmented by our synthesized radar. The network outperforms the counterpart trained only on raw radar data, a promising result to facilitate future radar-based research and development.

- **Summary**: Tracking and mapping in large-scale, unbounded outdoor environments using only monocular RGB input presents substantial challenges for existing SLAM systems. Traditional Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM methods are typically limited to small, bounded indoor settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GigaSLAM, the first NeRF/3DGS-based SLAM framework for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, as demonstrated on the KITTI and KITTI 360 datasets. Our approach employs a hierarchical sparse voxel map representation, where Gaussians are decoded by neural networks at multiple levels of detail. This design enables efficient, scalable mapping and high-fidelity viewpoint rendering across expansive, unbounded scenes. For front-end tracking, GigaSLAM utilizes a metric depth model combined with epipolar geometry and PnP algorithms to accurately estimate poses, while incorporating a Bag-of-Words-based loop closure mechanism to maintain robust alignment over long trajectories. Consequently, GigaSLAM delivers high-precision tracking and visually faithful rendering on urban outdoor benchmarks, establishing a robust SLAM solution for large-scale, long-term scenarios, and significantly extending the applicability of Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems to unbounded outdoor environments.

- **Summary**: Nighttime image dehazing is particularly challenging when dense haze and intense glow severely degrade or completely obscure background information. Existing methods often encounter difficulties due to insufficient background priors and limited generative ability, both essential for handling such conditions. In this paper, we introduce BeyondHaze, a generative nighttime dehazing method that not only significantly reduces haze and glow effects but also infers background information in regions where it may be absent. Our approach is developed on two main ideas: gaining strong background priors by adapting image diffusion models to the nighttime dehazing problem, and enhancing generative ability for haze- and glow-obscured scene areas through guided training. Task-specific nighttime dehazing knowledge is distilled into an image diffusion model in a manner that preserves its capacity to generate clean images. The diffusion model is additionally trained on image pairs designed to improve its ability to generate background details and content that are missing in the input image due to haze effects. Since generative models are susceptible to hallucinations, we develop our framework to allow user control over the generative level, balancing visual realism and factual accuracy. Experiments on real-world images demonstrate that BeyondHaze effectively restores visibility in dense nighttime haze.

- **Summary**: With the increasing need for facial behavior analysis, semi-supervised AU intensity estimation using only keyframe annotations has emerged as a practical and effective solution to relieve the burden of annotation. However, the lack of annotations makes the spurious correlation problem caused by AU co-occurrences and subject variation much more prominent, leading to non-robust intensity estimation that is entangled among AUs and biased among subjects. We observe that trend information inherent in keyframe annotations could act as extra supervision and raising the awareness of AU-specific facial appearance changing trends during training is the key to learning invariant AU-specific features. To this end, we propose \textbf{T}rend-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{S}upervision (TAS), which pursues three kinds of trend awareness, including intra-trend ranking awareness, intra-trend speed awareness, and inter-trend subject awareness. TAS alleviates the spurious correlation problem by raising trend awareness during training to learn AU-specific features that represent the corresponding facial appearance changes, to achieve intensity estimation invariance. Experiments conducted on two commonly used AU benchmark datasets, BP4D and DISFA, show the effectiveness of each kind of awareness. And under trend-aware supervision, the performance can be improved without extra computational or storage costs during inference.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advancements in federated learning (FL), the integration of generative models into FL has been limited due to challenges such as high communication costs and unstable training in heterogeneous data environments. To address these issues, we propose PRISM, a FL framework tailored for generative models that ensures (i) stable performance in heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) resource efficiency in terms of communication cost and final model size. The key of our method is to search for an optimal stochastic binary mask for a random network rather than updating the model weights, identifying a sparse subnetwork with high generative performance; i.e., a ``strong lottery ticket''. By communicating binary masks in a stochastic manner, PRISM minimizes communication overhead. This approach, combined with the utilization of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss and a mask-aware dynamic moving average aggregation method (MADA) on the server side, facilitates stable and strong generative capabilities by mitigating local divergence in FL scenarios. Moreover, thanks to its sparsifying characteristic, PRISM yields a lightweight model without extra pruning or quantization, making it ideal for environments such as edge devices. Experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR10 demonstrate that PRISM outperforms existing methods, while maintaining privacy with minimal communication costs. PRISM is the first to successfully generate images under challenging non-IID and privacy-preserving FL environments on complex datasets, where previous methods have struggled.

- **Summary**: Most previous 3D object detection methods that leverage the multi-modality of LiDAR and cameras utilize the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space for intermediate feature representation. However, this space uses a low x, y-resolution and sacrifices z-axis information to reduce the overall feature resolution, which may result in declined accuracy. To tackle the problem of using low-resolution features, this paper focuses on the sparse nature of LiDAR point cloud data. From our observation, the number of occupied cells in the 3D voxels constructed from a LiDAR data can be even fewer than the number of total cells in the BEV map, despite the voxels' significantly higher resolution. Based on this, we introduce a novel sparse voxel-based transformer network for 3D object detection, dubbed as SparseVoxFormer. Instead of performing BEV feature extraction, we directly leverage sparse voxel features as the input for a transformer-based detector. Moreover, with regard to the camera modality, we introduce an explicit modality fusion approach that involves projecting 3D voxel coordinates onto 2D images and collecting the corresponding image features. Thanks to these components, our approach can leverage geometrically richer multi-modal features while even reducing the computational cost. Beyond the proof-of-concept level, we further focus on facilitating better multi-modal fusion and flexible control over the number of sparse features. Finally, thorough experimental results demonstrate that utilizing a significantly smaller number of sparse features drastically reduces computational costs in a 3D object detector while enhancing both overall and long-range performance.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its high-quality rendering capabilities, ultra-fast training, and inference speeds. However, when we apply 3DGS to surface reconstruction tasks, especially in environments with dynamic objects and distractors, the method suffers from floating artifacts and color errors due to inconsistency from different viewpoints. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-View Consistency Gaussian Splatting for the domain of Robust Surface Reconstruction (\textbf{MVGSR}), which takes advantage of lightweight Gaussian models and a {heuristics-guided distractor masking} strategy for robust surface reconstruction in non-static environments. Compared to existing methods that rely on MLPs for distractor segmentation strategies, our approach separates distractors from static scene elements by comparing multi-view feature consistency, allowing us to obtain precise distractor masks early in training. Furthermore, we introduce a pruning measure based on multi-view contributions to reset transmittance, effectively reducing floating artifacts. Finally, a multi-view consistency loss is applied to achieve high-quality performance in surface reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MVGSR achieves competitive geometric accuracy and rendering fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction algorithms.

- **Summary**: Medical image denoising is essential for improving the reliability of clinical diagnosis and guiding subsequent image-based tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale approach that integrates anisotropic Gaussian filtering with progressive Bezier-path redrawing. Our method constructs a scale-space pyramid to mitigate noise while preserving critical structural details. Starting at the coarsest scale, we segment partially denoised images into coherent components and redraw each using a parametric Bezier path with representative color. Through iterative refinements at finer scales, small and intricate structures are accurately reconstructed, while large homogeneous regions remain robustly smoothed. We employ both mean square error and self-intersection constraints to maintain shape coherence during path optimization. Empirical results on multiple MRI datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in PSNR and SSIM over competing methods. This coarse-to-fine framework offers a robust, data-efficient solution for cross-domain denoising, reinforcing its potential clinical utility and versatility. Future work extends this technique to three-dimensional data.

- **Summary**: Pioneering text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have ushered in a new era of real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), significantly enhancing the visual perception of reconstructed images. However, existing methods typically integrate uniform abstract textual semantics across all blocks, overlooking the distinct semantic requirements at different depths and the fine-grained, concrete semantics inherently present in the images themselves. Moreover, relying solely on a single type of guidance further disrupts the consistency of reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose MegaSR, a novel framework that mines customized block-wise semantics and expressive guidance for diffusion-based ISR. Compared to uniform textual semantics, MegaSR enables flexible adaptation to multi-granularity semantic awareness by dynamically incorporating image attributes at each block. Furthermore, we experimentally identify HED edge maps, depth maps, and segmentation maps as the most expressive guidance, and propose a multi-stage aggregation strategy to modulate them into the T2I models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MegaSR in terms of semantic richness and structural consistency.

- **Summary**: Query-based methods with dense features have demonstrated remarkable success in 3D object detection tasks. However, the computational demands of these models, particularly with large image sizes and multiple transformer layers, pose significant challenges for efficient running on edge devices. Existing pruning and distillation methods either need retraining or are designed for ViT models, which are hard to migrate to 3D detectors. To address this issue, we propose a zero-shot runtime pruning method for transformer decoders in 3D object detection models. The method, termed tgGBC (trim keys gradually Guided By Classification scores), systematically trims keys in transformer modules based on their importance. We expand the classification score to multiply it with the attention map to get the importance score of each key and then prune certain keys after each transformer layer according to their importance scores. Our method achieves a 1.99x speedup in the transformer decoder of the latest ToC3D model, with only a minimal performance loss of less than 1%. Interestingly, for certain models, our method even enhances their performance. Moreover, we deploy 3D detectors with tgGBC on an edge device, further validating the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Accurate material retrieval is critical for creating realistic 3D assets. Existing methods rely on datasets that capture shape-invariant and lighting-varied representations of materials, which are scarce and face challenges due to limited diversity and inadequate real-world generalization. Most current approaches adopt traditional image search techniques. They fall short in capturing the unique properties of material spaces, leading to suboptimal performance in retrieval tasks. Addressing these challenges, we introduce MaRI, a framework designed to bridge the feature space gap between synthetic and real-world materials. MaRI constructs a shared embedding space that harmonizes visual and material attributes through a contrastive learning strategy by jointly training an image and a material encoder, bringing similar materials and images closer while separating dissimilar pairs within the feature space. To support this, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising high-quality synthetic materials rendered with controlled shape variations and diverse lighting conditions, along with real-world materials processed and standardized using material transfer techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance, accuracy, and generalization capabilities of MaRI across diverse and complex material retrieval tasks, outperforming existing methods.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating realistic images, but they raise societal and ethical concerns, such as the creation of unsafe content. While concept editing is proposed to address these issues, they often struggle to balance the removal of unsafe concept with maintaining the model's general genera-tive capabilities. In this work, we propose ACE, a new editing method that enhances concept editing in diffusion models. ACE introduces a novel cross null-space projection approach to precisely erase unsafe concept while maintaining the model's ability to generate high-quality, semantically consistent images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACE significantly outperforms the advancing baselines,improving semantic consistency by 24.56% and image generation quality by 34.82% on average with only 1% of the time cost. These results highlight the practical utility of concept editing by mitigating its potential risks, paving the way for broader applications in the field.

- **Summary**: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in foundational computer vision research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily focuses on $\textbf{coarse}$ facial attribute understanding, with limited capacity to handle $\textbf{fine-grained}$ facial attributes and without addressing generation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace, the first UMM tailored specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation. In general, we train Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace on a self-constructed, specialized dataset utilizing two mutually beneficial diffusion techniques and a two-level mixture-of-experts architecture. Specifically, we first build a large-scale facial dataset, Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K, which contains 130K image-text pairs with one million question-answering pairs that span a wide range of facial attributes. Second, we establish a theoretical connection between discrete diffusion score matching and masked generative models, optimizing both evidence lower bounds simultaneously, which significantly improves the model's ability to synthesize facial details. Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level mixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for both understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments on Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K demonstrate that Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models, achieving superior performance across both understanding and generation tasks.

- **Summary**: We introduce AG-VPReID, a challenging large-scale benchmark dataset for aerial-ground video-based person re-identification (ReID), comprising 6,632 identities, 32,321 tracklets, and 9.6 million frames captured from drones (15-120m altitude), CCTV, and wearable cameras. This dataset presents a real-world benchmark to investigate the robustness of Person ReID approaches against the unique challenges of cross-platform aerial-ground settings. To address these challenges, we propose AG-VPReID-Net, an end-to-end framework combining three complementary streams: (1) an Adapted Temporal-Spatial Stream addressing motion pattern inconsistencies and temporal feature learning, (2) a Normalized Appearance Stream using physics-informed techniques to tackle resolution and appearance changes, and (3) a Multi-Scale Attention Stream handling scale variations across drone altitudes. Our approach integrates complementary visual-semantic information from all streams to generate robust, viewpoint-invariant person representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AG-VPReID-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both our new dataset and other existing video-based ReID benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability. The relatively lower performance of all state-of-the-art approaches, including our proposed approach, on our new dataset highlights its challenging nature.

- **Summary**: We present a novel study on enhancing the capability of preserving the content in world models, focusing on a property we term World Stability. Recent diffusion-based generative models have advanced the synthesis of immersive and realistic environments that are pivotal for applications such as reinforcement learning and interactive game engines. However, while these models excel in quality and diversity, they often neglect the preservation of previously generated scenes over time--a shortfall that can introduce noise into agent learning and compromise performance in safety-critical settings. In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework that measures world stability by having world models perform a sequence of actions followed by their inverses to return to their initial viewpoint, thereby quantifying the consistency between the starting and ending observations. Our comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art diffusion-based world models reveals significant challenges in achieving high world stability. Moreover, we investigate several improvement strategies to enhance world stability. Our results underscore the importance of world stability in world modeling and provide actionable insights for future research in this domain.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based methods have achieved significant successes in T2I generation, providing realistic images from text prompts. Despite their capabilities, these models face persistent challenges in generating realistic human hands, often producing images with incorrect finger counts and structurally deformed hands. MGHanD addresses this challenge by applying multi-modal guidance during the inference process. For visual guidance, we employ a discriminator trained on a dataset comprising paired real and generated images with captions, derived from various hand-in-the-wild datasets. We also employ textual guidance with LoRA adapter, which learns the direction from `hands' towards more detailed prompts such as `natural hands', and `anatomically correct fingers' at the latent level. A cumulative hand mask which is gradually enlarged in the assigned time step is applied to the added guidance, allowing the hand to be refined while maintaining the rich generative capabilities of the pre-trained model. In the experiments, our method achieves superior hand generation qualities, without any specific conditions or priors. We carry out both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with user studies, to showcase the benefits of our approach in producing high-quality hand images.

- **Summary**: We tackle the challenge of concurrent reconstruction at the part level with the RGB appearance and estimation of motion parameters for building digital twins of articulated objects using the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) method. With two distinct sets of multi-view imagery, each depicting an object in separate static articulation configurations, we reconstruct the articulated object in 3D Gaussian representations with both appearance and geometry information at the same time. Our approach decoupled multiple highly interdependent parameters through a multi-step optimization process, thereby achieving a stable optimization procedure and high-quality outcomes. We introduce ArticulatedGS, a self-supervised, comprehensive framework that autonomously learns to model shapes and appearances at the part level and synchronizes the optimization of motion parameters, all without reliance on 3D supervision, motion cues, or semantic labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that, among comparable methodologies, our approach has achieved optimal outcomes in terms of part segmentation accuracy, motion estimation accuracy, and visual quality.

- **Summary**: Flow matching is a recent state-of-the-art framework for generative modeling based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While closely related to diffusion models, it provides a more general perspective on generative modeling. Although inverse problem solving has been extensively explored using diffusion models, it has not been rigorously examined within the broader context of flow models. Therefore, here we extend the diffusion inverse solvers (DIS) - which perform posterior sampling by combining a denoising diffusion prior with an likelihood gradient - into the flow framework. Specifically, by driving the flow-version of Tweedie's formula, we decompose the flow ODE into two components: one for clean image estimation and the other for noise estimation. By integrating the likelihood gradient and stochastic noise into each component, respectively, we demonstrate that posterior sampling for inverse problem solving can be effectively achieved using flows. Our proposed solver, Flow-Driven Posterior Sampling (FlowDPS), can also be seamlessly integrated into a latent flow model with a transformer architecture. Across four linear inverse problems, we confirm that FlowDPS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, all without requiring additional training.

- **Summary**: We present HOTFormerLoc, a novel and versatile Hierarchical Octree-based Transformer, for large-scale 3D place recognition in both ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial scenarios across urban and forest environments. We propose an octree-based multi-scale attention mechanism that captures spatial and semantic features across granularities. To address the variable density of point distributions from spinning lidar, we present cylindrical octree attention windows to reflect the underlying distribution during attention. We introduce relay tokens to enable efficient global-local interactions and multi-scale representation learning at reduced computational cost. Our pyramid attentional pooling then synthesises a robust global descriptor for end-to-end place recognition in challenging environments. In addition, we introduce CS-Wild-Places, a novel 3D cross-source dataset featuring point cloud data from aerial and ground lidar scans captured in dense forests. Point clouds in CS-Wild-Places contain representational gaps and distinctive attributes such as varying point densities and noise patterns, making it a challenging benchmark for cross-view localisation in the wild. HOTFormerLoc achieves a top-1 average recall improvement of 5.5% - 11.5% on the CS-Wild-Places benchmark. Furthermore, it consistently outperforms SOTA 3D place recognition methods, with an average performance gain of 5.8% on well-established urban and forest datasets. The code and CS-Wild-Places benchmark is available at https://csiro-robotics.github.io/HOTFormerLoc .

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a new framework for reducing the computational complexity of geometric vision problems through targeted reweighting of the cost functions used to minimize reprojection errors. Triangulation - the task of estimating a 3D point from noisy 2D projections across multiple images - is a fundamental problem in multiview geometry and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. We apply our framework to the two-view case and demonstrate that optimal triangulation, which requires solving a univariate polynomial of degree six, can be simplified through cost function reweighting reducing the polynomial degree to two. This reweighting yields a closed-form solution while preserving strong geometric accuracy. We derive optimal weighting strategies, establish theoretical bounds on the approximation error, and provide experimental results on real data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to standard methods. Although this work focuses on two-view triangulation, the framework generalizes to other geometric vision problems.

- **Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLMs) and visionlanguage models (VLMs) have achieved significant success, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding various images and videos, particularly in classification and detection tasks. However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often fails to yield satisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we utilize publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10, to convert traditional annotation information into natural language, thereby constructing an instruction-tuning (SFT) dataset for VLM training. We then evaluate the detection performance of different fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and obtain optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we assess the model's prior knowledge capabilities through natural language queries.Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our dataset and relevant code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Object Tracking (OV-MOT) aims to enable approaches to track objects without being limited to a predefined set of categories. Current OV-MOT methods typically rely primarily on instance-level detection and association, often overlooking trajectory information that is unique and essential for object tracking tasks. Utilizing trajectory information can enhance association stability and classification accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion and category ambiguity, thereby improving adaptability to novel classes. Thus motivated, in this paper we propose \textbf{TRACT}, an open-vocabulary tracker that leverages trajectory information to improve both object association and classification in OV-MOT. Specifically, we introduce a \textit{Trajectory Consistency Reinforcement} (\textbf{TCR}) strategy, that benefits tracking performance by improving target identity and category consistency. In addition, we present \textbf{TraCLIP}, a plug-and-play trajectory classification module. It integrates \textit{Trajectory Feature Aggregation} (\textbf{TFA}) and \textit{Trajectory Semantic Enrichment} (\textbf{TSE}) strategies to fully leverage trajectory information from visual and language perspectives for enhancing the classification results. Extensive experiments on OV-TAO show that our TRACT significantly improves tracking performance, highlighting trajectory information as a valuable asset for OV-MOT. Code will be released.

- **Summary**: In this work, we implement music production for silent film clips using LLM-driven method. Given the strong professional demands of film music production, we propose the FilmComposer, simulating the actual workflows of professional musicians. FilmComposer is the first to combine large generative models with a multi-agent approach, leveraging the advantages of both waveform music and symbolic music generation. Additionally, FilmComposer is the first to focus on the three core elements of music production for film-audio quality, musicality, and musical development-and introduces various controls, such as rhythm, semantics, and visuals, to enhance these key aspects. Specifically, FilmComposer consists of the visual processing module, rhythm-controllable MusicGen, and multi-agent assessment, arrangement and mix. In addition, our framework can seamlessly integrate into the actual music production pipeline and allows user intervention in every step, providing strong interactivity and a high degree of creative freedom. Furthermore, we propose MusicPro-7k which includes 7,418 film clips, music, description, rhythm spots and main melody, considering the lack of a professional and high-quality film music dataset. Finally, both the standard metrics and the new specialized metrics we propose demonstrate that the music generated by our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality, consistency with video, diversity, musicality, and musical development.

- **Summary**: Recently, images that distort or fabricate facts using generative models have become a social concern. To cope with continuous evolution of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, model attribution (MA) is necessary beyond just detection of synthetic images. However, current deep learning-based MA methods must be trained from scratch with new data to recognize unseen models, which is time-consuming and data-intensive. This work proposes a new strategy to deal with persistently emerging generative models. We adapt few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) mechanisms for MA problem to uncover novel generative AI models. Unlike existing FSCIL approaches that focus on object classification using high-level information, MA requires analyzing low-level details like color and texture in synthetic images. Thus, we utilize a learnable representation from different levels of CLIP-ViT features. To learn an effective representation, we propose Adaptive Integration Module (AIM) to calculate a weighted sum of CLIP-ViT block features for each image, enhancing the ability to identify generative models. Extensive experiments show our method effectively extends from prior generative models to recent ones.

- **Summary**: Indiscernible marine object counting encounters numerous challenges, including limited visibility in underwater scenes, mutual occlusion and overlap among objects, and the dynamic similarity in appearance, color, and texture between the background and foreground. These factors significantly complicate the counting process. To address the scarcity of video-based indiscernible object counting datasets, we have developed a novel dataset comprising 50 videos, from which approximately 800 frames have been extracted and annotated with around 40,800 point-wise object labels. This dataset accurately represents real underwater environments where indiscernible marine objects are intricately integrated with their surroundings, thereby comprehensively illustrating the aforementioned challenges in object counting. To address these challenges, we propose a depth-assisted network with adaptive motion-differentiated feature encoding. The network consists of a backbone encoding module and three branches: a depth-assisting branch, a density estimation branch, and a motion weight generation branch. Depth-aware features extracted by the depth-assisting branch are enhanced via a depth-enhanced encoder to improve object representation. Meanwhile, weights from the motion weight generation branch refine multi-scale perception features in the adaptive flow estimation module. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed dataset but also yields competitive results on three additional video-based crowd counting datasets. The pre-trained model, code, and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/OUCVisionGroup/VIMOC-Net.

- **Summary**: Recent rapid advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation, such as SoRA and Kling, have shown great potential for building world simulators. However, current T2V models struggle to grasp abstract physical principles and generate videos that adhere to physical laws. This challenge arises primarily from a lack of clear guidance on physical information due to a significant gap between abstract physical principles and generation models. To this end, we introduce the World Simulator Assistant (WISA), an effective framework for decomposing and incorporating physical principles into T2V models. Specifically, WISA decomposes physical principles into textual physical descriptions, qualitative physical categories, and quantitative physical properties. To effectively embed these physical attributes into the generation process, WISA incorporates several key designs, including Mixture-of-Physical-Experts Attention (MoPA) and a Physical Classifier, enhancing the model's physics awareness. Furthermore, most existing datasets feature videos where physical phenomena are either weakly represented or entangled with multiple co-occurring processes, limiting their suitability as dedicated resources for learning explicit physical principles. We propose a novel video dataset, WISA-32K, collected based on qualitative physical categories. It consists of 32,000 videos, representing 17 physical laws across three domains of physics: dynamics, thermodynamics, and optics. Experimental results demonstrate that WISA can effectively enhance the compatibility of T2V models with real-world physical laws, achieving a considerable improvement on the VideoPhy benchmark. The visual exhibitions of WISA and WISA-32K are available in the https://360cvgroup.github.io/WISA/.

- **Summary**: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) aims to reduce the scales of pre-trained models for multiple downstream tasks. However, as the models keep scaling up, the memory footprint of existing PETL methods is not significantly reduced compared to the reduction of learnable parameters. This limitation hinders the practical deployment of PETL methods on memory-constrained devices. To this end, we proposed a new PETL framework, called Structure to Activation (S2A), to reduce the memory footprint of activation during fine-tuning. Specifically, our framework consists of: 1)Activation modules design(i.e. bias, prompt and side modules) in the parametric model structure, which results in a significant reduction of adjustable parameters and activation memory 2) 4-bit quantisation of activations based on their derivatives for non-parametric structures (e.g., nonlinear functions), which maintains accuracy while significantly reducing memory usage. Our S2A method consequently offers a lightweight solution in terms of both parameter and memory footprint. We evaluate S2A with different backbones and conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate the effectiveness. The results show that our method not only outperforms existing PETL techniques, achieving a fourfold reduction in GPU memory footprint on average, but also shows competitive performance in accuracy with lower tunable parameters. These also demonstrate that our method is highly suitable for practical transfer learning on hardware-constrained devices.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant promise in advancing organic chemistry research; however, its effectiveness depends on the availability of high-quality chemical reaction data. Currently, most published chemical reactions are not available in machine-readable form, limiting the broader application of AI in this field. The extraction of published chemical reactions into structured databases still relies heavily on manual curation, and robust automatic parsing of chemical reaction images into machine-readable data remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Reaction Image Multimodal large language model (RxnIM), the first multimodal large language model specifically designed to parse chemical reaction images into machine-readable reaction data. RxnIM not only extracts key chemical components from reaction images but also interprets the textual content that describes reaction conditions. Together with specially designed large-scale dataset generation method to support model training, our approach achieves excellent performance, with an average F1 score of 88% on various benchmarks, surpassing literature methods by 5%. This represents a crucial step toward the automatic construction of large databases of machine-readable reaction data parsed from images in the chemistry literature, providing essential data resources for AI research in chemistry. The source code, model checkpoints, and datasets developed in this work are released under permissive licenses. An instance of the RxnIM web application can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/spaces/CYF200127/RxnIM.

- **Summary**: Ultra-high quality artistic style transfer refers to repainting an ultra-high quality content image using the style information learned from the style image. Existing artistic style transfer methods can be categorized into style reconstruction-based and content-style disentanglement-based style transfer approaches. Although these methods can generate some artistic stylized images, they still exhibit obvious artifacts and disharmonious patterns, which hinder their ability to produce ultra-high quality artistic stylized images. To address these issues, we propose a novel artistic image style transfer method, U-StyDiT, which is built on transformer-based diffusion (DiT) and learns content-style disentanglement, generating ultra-high quality artistic stylized images. Specifically, we first design a Multi-view Style Modulator (MSM) to learn style information from a style image from local and global perspectives, conditioning U-StyDiT to generate stylized images with the learned style information. Then, we introduce a StyDiT Block to learn content and style conditions simultaneously from a style image. Additionally, we propose an ultra-high quality artistic image dataset, Aes4M, comprising 10 categories, each containing 400,000 style images. This dataset effectively solves the problem that the existing style transfer methods cannot produce high-quality artistic stylized images due to the size of the dataset and the quality of the images in the dataset. Finally, the extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments validate that our U-StyDiT can create higher quality stylized images compared to state-of-the-art artistic style transfer methods. To our knowledge, our proposed method is the first to address the generation of ultra-high quality stylized images using transformer-based diffusion.

- **Summary**: We introduce AvatarForge, a framework for generating animatable 3D human avatars from text or image inputs using AI-driven procedural generation. While diffusion-based methods have made strides in general 3D object generation, they struggle with high-quality, customizable human avatars due to the complexity and diversity of human body shapes, poses, exacerbated by the scarcity of high-quality data. Additionally, animating these avatars remains a significant challenge for existing methods. AvatarForge overcomes these limitations by combining LLM-based commonsense reasoning with off-the-shelf 3D human generators, enabling fine-grained control over body and facial details. Unlike diffusion models which often rely on pre-trained datasets lacking precise control over individual human features, AvatarForge offers a more flexible approach, bringing humans into the iterative design and modeling loop, with its auto-verification system allowing for continuous refinement of the generated avatars, and thus promoting high accuracy and customization. Our evaluations show that AvatarForge outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both text- and image-to-avatar generation, making it a versatile tool for artistic creation and animation.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods show significant advantages in reducing noise and improving visibility in low-light conditions. These methods are typically based on one-to-one mapping, where the model learns a direct transformation from low light to specific enhanced images. Therefore, these methods are inflexible as they do not allow highly personalized mapping, even though an individual's lighting preferences are inherently personalized. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new light enhancement task and a new framework that provides customized lighting control through prompt-driven, semantic-level, and quantitative brightness adjustments. The framework begins by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand natural language prompts, enabling it to identify target objects for brightness adjustments. To localize these target objects, the Retinex-based Reasoning Segment (RRS) module generates precise target localization masks using reflection images. Subsequently, the Text-based Brightness Controllable (TBC) module adjusts brightness levels based on the generated illumination map. Finally, an Adaptive Contextual Compensation (ACC) module integrates multi-modal inputs and controls a conditional diffusion model to adjust the lighting, ensuring seamless and precise enhancements accurately. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate our framework's superior performance at increasing visibility, maintaining natural color balance, and amplifying fine details without creating artifacts. Furthermore, its robust generalization capabilities enable complex semantic-level lighting adjustments in diverse open-world environments through natural language interactions.

- **Summary**: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to estimate the location of the given query image within a database of geo-tagged images. To identify the exact location in an image, detecting landmarks is crucial. However, in some scenarios, such as urban environments, there are numerous landmarks, such as various modern buildings, and the landmarks in different cities often exhibit high visual similarity. Therefore, it is essential not only to leverage the landmarks but also to consider the contextual information surrounding them, such as whether there are trees, roads, or other features around the landmarks. We propose the Contextual Query VPR (CQVPR), which integrates contextual information with detailed pixel-level visual features. By leveraging a set of learnable contextual queries, our method automatically learns the high-level contexts with respect to landmarks and their surrounding areas. Heatmaps depicting regions that each query attends to serve as context-aware features, offering cues that could enhance the understanding of each scene. We further propose a query matching loss to supervise the extraction process of contextual queries. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: Medical image re-identification (MedReID) is under-explored so far, despite its critical applications in personalized healthcare and privacy protection. In this paper, we introduce a thorough benchmark and a unified model for this problem. First, to handle various medical modalities, we propose a novel Continuous Modality-based Parameter Adapter (ComPA). ComPA condenses medical content into a continuous modality representation and dynamically adjusts the modality-agnostic model with modality-specific parameters at runtime. This allows a single model to adaptively learn and process diverse modality data. Furthermore, we integrate medical priors into our model by aligning it with a bag of pre-trained medical foundation models, in terms of the differential features. Compared to single-image feature, modeling the inter-image difference better fits the re-identification problem, which involves discriminating multiple images. We evaluate the proposed model against 25 foundation models and 8 large multi-modal language models across 11 image datasets, demonstrating consistently superior performance. Additionally, we deploy the proposed MedReID technique to two real-world applications, i.e., history-augmented personalized diagnosis and medical privacy protection. Codes and model is available at \href{https://github.com/tianyuan168326/All-in-One-MedReID-Pytorch}{https://github.com/tianyuan168326/All-in-One-MedReID-Pytorch}.

- **Summary**: Styled motion in-betweening is crucial for computer animation and gaming. However, existing methods typically encode motion styles by modeling whole-body motions, often overlooking the representation of individual body parts. This limitation reduces the flexibility of infilled motion, particularly in adjusting the motion styles of specific limbs independently. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework that models motion styles at the body-part level, enhancing both the diversity and controllability of infilled motions. Our approach enables more nuanced and expressive animations by allowing precise modifications to individual limb motions while maintaining overall motion coherence. Leveraging phase-related insights, our framework employs periodic autoencoders to automatically extract the phase of each body part, capturing distinctive local style features. Additionally, we effectively decouple the motion source from synthesis control by integrating motion manifold learning and conditional generation techniques from both image and motion domains. This allows the motion source to generate high-quality motions across various styles, with extracted motion and style features readily available for controlled synthesis in subsequent tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior speed, robust generalization, and effective generation of extended motion sequences.

- **Summary**: Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from replicating human-like behaviors, generalizing effectively in multi-agent scenarios, and overcoming inherent interpretability issues.These tasks are compounded when deep environment understanding, agent coordination and dynamic optimization are required. While Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced methods have shown promise in generalization and interoperability, they often neglect necessary multi-agent coordination. Therefore, we introduce the Cascading Cooperative Multi-agent (CCMA) framework, integrating RL for individual interactions, a fine-tuned LLM for regional cooperation, a reward function for global optimization, and the Retrieval-augmented Generation mechanism to dynamically optimize decision-making across complex driving scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the CCMA outperforms existing RL methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both micro and macro-level performance in complex driving environments.

- **Summary**: Human-centric visual perception (HVP) has recently achieved remarkable progress due to advancements in large-scale self-supervised pretraining (SSP). However, existing HVP models face limitations in adapting to real-world applications, which require general visual patterns for downstream tasks while maintaining computationally sustainable costs to ensure compatibility with edge devices. These limitations primarily arise from two issues: 1) the pretraining objectives focus solely on specific visual patterns, limiting the generalizability of the learned patterns for diverse downstream tasks; and 2) HVP models often exhibit excessively large model sizes, making them incompatible with real-world applications. To address these limitations, we introduce Scale-Aware Image Pretraining (SAIP), a novel SSP framework enabling lightweight vision models to acquire general patterns for HVP. Specifically, SAIP incorporates three learning objectives based on the principle of cross-scale consistency: 1) Cross-scale Matching (CSM) which contrastively learns image-level invariant patterns from multi-scale single-person images; 2) Cross-scale Reconstruction (CSR) which learns pixel-level consistent visual structures from multi-scale masked single-person images; and 3) Cross-scale Search (CSS) which learns to capture diverse patterns from multi-scale multi-person images. Three objectives complement one another, enabling lightweight models to learn multi-scale generalizable patterns essential for HVP downstream tasks.Extensive experiments conducted across 12 HVP datasets demonstrate that SAIP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities across 9 human-centric vision tasks. Moreover, it achieves significant performance improvements over existing methods, with gains of 3%-13% in single-person discrimination tasks, 1%-11% in dense prediction tasks, and 1%-6% in multi-person visual understanding tasks.

- **Summary**: Supervised contrastive learning (SupCL) has emerged as a prominent approach in representation learning, leveraging both supervised and self-supervised losses. However, achieving an optimal balance between these losses is challenging; failing to do so can lead to class collapse, reducing discrimination among individual embeddings in the same class. In this paper, we present theoretically grounded guidelines for SupCL to prevent class collapse in learned representations. Specifically, we introduce the Simplex-to-Simplex Embedding Model (SSEM), a theoretical framework that models various embedding structures, including all embeddings that minimize the supervised contrastive loss. Through SSEM, we analyze how hyperparameters affect learned representations, offering practical guidelines for hyperparameter selection to mitigate the risk of class collapse. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical results across synthetic and real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: The primary challenge in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) mainly stems from the presence of multi-orientational and long-term motions. However, current research overlooks these crucial aspects, significantly impacting accuracy. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel CSLR framework: Orientation-aware Long-term Motion Decoupling (OLMD), which efficiently aggregates long-term motions and decouples multi-orientational signals into easily interpretable components. Specifically, our innovative Long-term Motion Aggregation (LMA) module filters out static redundancy while adaptively capturing abundant features of long-term motions. We further enhance orientation awareness by decoupling complex movements into horizontal and vertical components, allowing for motion purification in both orientations. Additionally, two coupling mechanisms are proposed: stage and cross-stage coupling, which together enrich multi-scale features and improve the generalization capabilities of the model. Experimentally, OLMD shows SOTA performance on three large-scale datasets: PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, and CSL-Daily. Notably, we improved the word error rate (WER) on PHOENIX14 by an absolute 1.6% compared to the previous SOTA

This paper presents a detailed evaluation of automated metrics for evaluating structured 3D reconstructions. Pitfalls of each metric are discussed, and a thorough analyses through the lens of expert 3D modelers' preferences is presented. A set of systematic "unit tests" are proposed to empirically verify desirable properties, and context aware recommendations as to which metric to use depending on application are provided. Finally, a learned metric distilled from human expert judgments is proposed and analyzed.

- **Summary**: Despite their success, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to hallucinations. While existing studies attribute the cause of hallucinations to insufficient visual attention to image tokens, our findings indicate that hallucinations also arise from interference from instruction tokens during decoding. Intuitively, certain instruction tokens continuously distort LVLMs' visual perception during decoding, hijacking their visual attention toward less discriminative visual regions. This distortion prevents them integrating broader contextual information from images, ultimately leading to hallucinations. We term this phenomenon 'Attention Hijacking', where disruptive instruction tokens act as 'Attention Hijackers'. To address this, we propose a novel, training-free strategy namely Attention HIjackers Detection and Disentanglement (AID), designed to isolate the influence of Hijackers, enabling LVLMs to rely on their context-aware intrinsic attention map. Specifically, AID consists of three components: First, Attention Hijackers Detection identifies Attention Hijackers by calculating instruction-driven visual salience. Next, Attention Disentanglement mechanism is proposed to mask the visual attention of these identified Hijackers, and thereby mitigate their disruptive influence on subsequent tokens. Finally, Re-Disentanglement recalculates the balance between instruction-driven and image-driven visual salience to avoid over-masking effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AID significantly reduces hallucination across various LVLMs on several benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has reshaped the field of photorealistic 3D reconstruction, achieving impressive rendering quality and speed. However, when applied to large-scale street scenes, existing methods suffer from rapidly escalating per-viewpoint reconstruction costs as scene size increases, leading to significant computational overhead. After revisiting the conventional pipeline, we identify three key factors accounting for this issue: unnecessary local-to-global transformations, excessive 3D-to-2D projections, and inefficient rendering of distant content. To address these challenges, we propose S3R-GS, a 3DGS framework that Streamlines the pipeline for large-scale Street Scene Reconstruction, effectively mitigating these limitations. Moreover, most existing street 3DGS methods rely on ground-truth 3D bounding boxes to separate dynamic and static components, but 3D bounding boxes are difficult to obtain, limiting real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an alternative solution with 2D boxes, which are easier to annotate or can be predicted by off-the-shelf vision foundation models. Such designs together make S3R-GS readily adapt to large, in-the-wild scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S3R-GS enhances rendering quality and significantly accelerates reconstruction. Remarkably, when applied to videos from the challenging Argoverse2 dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art PSNR and SSIM, reducing reconstruction time to below 50%--and even 20%--of competing methods.

- **Summary**: 3D human reconstruction from a single image is a challenging problem and has been exclusively studied in the literature. Recently, some methods have resorted to diffusion models for guidance, optimizing a 3D representation via Score Distillation Sampling(SDS) or generating one back-view image for facilitating reconstruction. However, these methods tend to produce unsatisfactory artifacts (\textit{e.g.} flattened human structure or over-smoothing results caused by inconsistent priors from multiple views) and struggle with real-world generalization in the wild. In this work, we present \emph{MVD-HuGaS}, enabling free-view 3D human rendering from a single image via a multi-view human diffusion model. We first generate multi-view images from the single reference image with an enhanced multi-view diffusion model, which is well fine-tuned on high-quality 3D human datasets to incorporate 3D geometry priors and human structure priors. To infer accurate camera poses from the sparse generated multi-view images for reconstruction, an alignment module is introduced to facilitate joint optimization of 3D Gaussians and camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a depth-based Facial Distortion Mitigation module to refine the generated facial regions, thereby improving the overall fidelity of the reconstruction.Finally, leveraging the refined multi-view images, along with their accurate camera poses, MVD-HuGaS optimizes the 3D Gaussians of the target human for high-fidelity free-view renderings. Extensive experiments on Thuman2.0 and 2K2K datasets show that the proposed MVD-HuGaS achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-view 3D human rendering.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods have achieved promising progress recently. However, previous methods primarily depend on the photometric consistency assumption, which may suffer from two limitations: indistinguishable regions and view-dependent effects, e.g., low-textured areas and reflections. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new dual-level contrastive learning approach, named CL-MVSNet. Specifically, our model integrates two contrastive branches into an unsupervised MVS framework to construct additional supervisory signals. On the one hand, we present an image-level contrastive branch to guide the model to acquire more context awareness, thus leading to more complete depth estimation in indistinguishable regions. On the other hand, we exploit a scene-level contrastive branch to boost the representation ability, improving robustness to view-dependent effects. Moreover, to recover more accurate 3D geometry, we introduce an L0.5 photometric consistency loss, which encourages the model to focus more on accurate points while mitigating the gradient penalty of undesirable ones. Extensive experiments on DTU and Tanks&Temples benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among all end-to-end unsupervised MVS frameworks and outperforms its supervised counterpart by a considerable margin without fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: We present EgoBlind, the first egocentric VideoQA dataset collected from blind individuals to evaluate the assistive capabilities of contemporary multimodal large language models (MLLMs). EgoBlind comprises 1,210 videos that record the daily lives of real blind users from a first-person perspective. It also features 4,927 questions directly posed or generated and verified by blind individuals to reflect their needs for visual assistance under various scenarios. We provide each question with an average of 3 reference answers to alleviate subjective evaluation. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively evaluate 15 leading MLLMs and find that all models struggle, with the best performers achieving accuracy around 56\%, far behind human performance of 87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and provide heuristic suggestions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope EgoBlind can serve as a valuable foundation for developing more effective AI assistants to enhance the independence of the blind individuals' lives.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing animatable and high-quality 3D head avatars from monocular videos, especially with realistic relighting, is a valuable task. However, the limited information from single-view input, combined with the complex head poses and facial movements, makes this challenging. Previous methods achieve real-time performance by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a parametric head model, but the resulting head quality suffers from inaccurate face tracking and limited expressiveness of the deformation model. These methods also fail to produce realistic effects under novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we propose HRAvatar, a 3DGS-based method that reconstructs high-fidelity, relightable 3D head avatars. HRAvatar reduces tracking errors through end-to-end optimization and better captures individual facial deformations using learnable blendshapes and learnable linear blend skinning. Additionally, it decomposes head appearance into several physical properties and incorporates physically-based shading to account for environmental lighting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HRAvatar not only reconstructs superior-quality heads but also achieves realistic visual effects under varying lighting conditions.

- **Summary**: Large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to leveraging human language for enhancing downstream tasks. However, VLMs such as CLIP face significant limitation: its performance is highly sensitive to prompt template design. Although prompt learning methods can address the sensitivity issue by replacing natural language prompts with learnable ones, they are incomprehensible to humans. Ensuring consistent performance across various prompt templates enables models to adapt seamlessly to diverse phrasings, enhancing their ability to handle downstream tasks without requiring extensive prompt engineering. In this work, we introduce the RobustPrompt Benchmark, a systematic benchmark to evaluate robustness to different prompt templates for VLMs. It includes a dataset with hundreds of carefully designed prompt templates, divided into six types, covering a wide variety of commonly used templates. Beside the benchmark, we propose Modeling Variants of Prompts (MVP), a simple yet effective method that mitigates sensitivity by modeling variants of prompt structures. The innovation of MVP lies in decoupling prompts into templates and class names, and using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to model the distribution of diverse prompt structures. Experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that MVP can greatly enhance model robustness to variations in input prompts without a drop in performance.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral-spatial information across hundreds of contiguous bands, enabling precise material discrimination in applications such as environmental monitoring, agriculture, and urban analysis. However, the high dimensionality and spectral variability of HSI data pose significant challenges for feature extraction and classification. This paper presents EnergyFormer, a transformer-based framework designed to address these challenges through three key innovations: (1) Multi-Head Energy Attention (MHEA), which optimizes an energy function to selectively enhance critical spectral-spatial features, improving feature discrimination; (2) Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which adaptively encodes spectral and spatial dependencies to reinforce long-range interactions; and (3) Enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module (ECBAM), which selectively amplifies informative wavelength bands and spatial structures, enhancing representation learning. Extensive experiments on the WHU-Hi-HanChuan, Salinas, and Pavia University datasets demonstrate that EnergyFormer achieves exceptional overall accuracies of 99.28\%, 98.63\%, and 98.72\%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art CNN, transformer, and Mamba-based models.

- **Summary**: Advancing safe autonomous systems through reinforcement learning (RL) requires robust benchmarks to evaluate performance, analyze methods, and assess agent competencies. Humans primarily rely on embodied visual perception to safely navigate and interact with their surroundings, making it a valuable capability for RL agents. However, existing vision-based 3D benchmarks only consider simple navigation tasks. To address this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{HASARD}, a suite of diverse and complex tasks to $\textbf{HA}$rness $\textbf{SA}$fe $\textbf{R}$L with $\textbf{D}$oom, requiring strategic decision-making, comprehending spatial relationships, and predicting the short-term future. HASARD features three difficulty levels and two action spaces. An empirical evaluation of popular baseline methods demonstrates the benchmark's complexity, unique challenges, and reward-cost trade-offs. Visualizing agent navigation during training with top-down heatmaps provides insight into a method's learning process. Incrementally training across difficulty levels offers an implicit learning curriculum. HASARD is the first safe RL benchmark to exclusively target egocentric vision-based learning, offering a cost-effective and insightful way to explore the potential and boundaries of current and future safe RL methods. The environments and baseline implementations are open-sourced at https://sites.google.com/view/hasard-bench/.

- **Summary**: While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.

- **Summary**: Modern diffusion models encounter a fundamental trade-off between training efficiency and generation quality. While existing representation alignment methods, such as REPA, accelerate convergence through patch-wise alignment, they often fail to capture structural relationships within visual representations and ensure global distribution consistency between pretrained encoders and denoising networks. To address these limitations, we introduce SARA, a hierarchical alignment framework that enforces multi-level representation constraints: (1) patch-wise alignment to preserve local semantic details, (2) autocorrelation matrix alignment to maintain structural consistency within representations, and (3) adversarial distribution alignment to mitigate global representation discrepancies. Unlike previous approaches, SARA explicitly models both intra-representation correlations via self-similarity matrices and inter-distribution coherence via adversarial alignment, enabling comprehensive alignment across local and global scales. Experiments on ImageNet-256 show that SARA achieves an FID of 1.36 while converging twice as fast as REPA, surpassing recent state-of-the-art image generation methods. This work establishes a systematic paradigm for optimizing diffusion training through hierarchical representation alignment.

- **Summary**: A dexterous hand capable of grasping any object is essential for the development of general-purpose embodied intelligent robots. However, due to the high degree of freedom in dexterous hands and the vast diversity of objects, generating high-quality, usable grasping poses in a robust manner is a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce DexGrasp Anything, a method that effectively integrates physical constraints into both the training and sampling phases of a diffusion-based generative model, achieving state-of-the-art performance across nearly all open datasets. Additionally, we present a new dexterous grasping dataset containing over 3.4 million diverse grasping poses for more than 15k different objects, demonstrating its potential to advance universal dexterous grasping.

- **Summary**: Recent Customized Portrait Generation (CPG) methods, taking a facial image and a textual prompt as inputs, have attracted substantial attention. Although these methods generate high-fidelity portraits, they fail to prevent the generated portraits from being tracked and misused by malicious face recognition systems. To address this, this paper proposes a Customized Portrait Generation framework with facial Adversarial attacks (Adv-CPG). Specifically, to achieve facial privacy protection, we devise a lightweight local ID encryptor and an encryption enhancer. They implement progressive double-layer encryption protection by directly injecting the target identity and adding additional identity guidance, respectively. Furthermore, to accomplish fine-grained and personalized portrait generation, we develop a multi-modal image customizer capable of generating controlled fine-grained facial features. To the best of our knowledge, Adv-CPG is the first study that introduces facial adversarial attacks into CPG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Adv-CPG, e.g., the average attack success rate of the proposed Adv-CPG is 28.1% and 2.86% higher compared to the SOTA noise-based attack methods and unconstrained attack methods, respectively.

- **Summary**: Human reaction generation represents a significant research domain for interactive AI, as humans constantly interact with their surroundings. Previous works focus mainly on synthesizing the reactive motion given a human motion sequence. This paradigm limits interaction categories to human-human interactions and ignores emotions that may influence reaction generation. In this work, we propose to generate 3D human reactions from RGB videos, which involves a wider range of interaction categories and naturally provides information about expressions that may reflect the subject's emotions. To cope with this task, we present HERO, a simple yet powerful framework for Human rEaction geneRation from videOs. HERO considers both global and frame-level local representations of the video to extract the interaction intention, and then uses the extracted interaction intention to guide the synthesis of the reaction. Besides, local visual representations are continuously injected into the model to maximize the exploitation of the dynamic properties inherent in videos. Furthermore, the ViMo dataset containing paired Video-Motion data is collected to support the task. In addition to human-human interactions, these video-motion pairs also cover animal-human interactions and scene-human interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our methodology. The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://jackyu6.github.io/HERO.

- **Summary**: Learning and improving large language models through human preference feedback has become a mainstream approach, but it has rarely been applied to the field of low-light image enhancement. Existing low-light enhancement evaluations typically rely on objective metrics (such as FID, PSNR, etc.), which often result in models that perform well objectively but lack aesthetic quality. Moreover, most low-light enhancement models are primarily designed for global brightening, lacking detailed refinement. Therefore, the generated images often require additional local adjustments, leading to research gaps in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose the following innovations: 1) We collect human aesthetic evaluation text pairs and aesthetic scores from multiple low-light image datasets (e.g., LOL, LOL2, LOM, DCIM, MEF, etc.) to train a low-light image aesthetic evaluation model, supplemented by an optimization algorithm designed to fine-tune the diffusion model. 2) We propose a prompt-driven brightness adjustment module capable of performing fine-grained brightness and aesthetic adjustments for specific instances or regions. 3) We evaluate our method alongside existing state-of-the-art algorithms on mainstream benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms traditional methods in terms of visual quality but also provides greater flexibility and controllability, paving the way for improved aesthetic quality.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained control of text-to-image diffusion transformer models (DiT) remains a critical challenge for practical deployment. While recent advances such as OminiControl and others have enabled a controllable generation of diverse control signals, these methods face significant computational inefficiency when handling long conditional inputs. We present OminiControl2, an efficient framework that achieves efficient image-conditional image generation. OminiControl2 introduces two key innovations: (1) a dynamic compression strategy that streamlines conditional inputs by preserving only the most semantically relevant tokens during generation, and (2) a conditional feature reuse mechanism that computes condition token features only once and reuses them across denoising steps. These architectural improvements preserve the original framework's parameter efficiency and multi-modal versatility while dramatically reducing computational costs. Our experiments demonstrate that OminiControl2 reduces conditional processing overhead by over 90% compared to its predecessor, achieving an overall 5.9$\times$ speedup in multi-conditional generation scenarios. This efficiency enables the practical implementation of complex, multi-modal control for high-quality image synthesis with DiT models.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is essential for analyzing highdefinition remote sensing images (HRSIs) because it allows the precise classification of objects and regions at the pixel level. However, remote sensing data present challenges owing to geographical location, weather, and environmental variations, making it difficult for semantic segmentation models to generalize across diverse scenarios. Existing methods are often limited to specific data domains and require expert annotators and specialized equipment for semantic labeling. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation technique for remote sensing semantic segmentation by utilizing geographical coordinates that are readily accessible in remote sensing setups as metadata in a dataset. To bridge the domain gap, we propose a novel approach that considers the combination of an image\'s location encoding trait and the spherical nature of Earth\'s surface. Our proposed SegDesicNet module regresses the GRID positional encoding of the geo coordinates projected over the unit sphere to obtain the domain loss. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SegDesicNet outperforms state of the art domain adaptation methods in remote sensing image segmentation, achieving an improvement of approximately ~6% in the mean intersection over union (MIoU) with a ~ 27\% drop in parameter count on benchmarked subsets of the publicly available FLAIR #1 dataset. We also benchmarked our method performance on the custom split of the ISPRS Potsdam dataset. Our algorithm seeks to reduce the modeling disparity between artificial neural networks and human comprehension of the physical world, making the technology more human centric and scalable.

- **Summary**: Burst image processing (BIP), which captures and integrates multiple frames into a single high-quality image, is widely used in consumer cameras. As a typical BIP task, Burst Image Super-Resolution (BISR) has achieved notable progress through deep learning in recent years. Existing BISR methods typically involve three key stages: alignment, upsampling, and fusion, often in varying orders and implementations. Among these stages, alignment is particularly critical for ensuring accurate feature matching and further reconstruction. However, existing methods often rely on techniques such as deformable convolutions and optical flow to realize alignment, which either focus only on local transformations or lack theoretical grounding, thereby limiting their performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework for BISR, featuring an equivariant convolution-based alignment, ensuring consistent transformations between the image and feature domains. This enables the alignment transformation to be learned via explicit supervision in the image domain and easily applied in the feature domain in a theoretically sound way, effectively improving alignment accuracy. Additionally, we design an effective reconstruction module with advanced deep architectures for upsampling and fusion to obtain the final BISR result. Extensive experiments on BISR benchmarks show the superior performance of our approach in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

- **Summary**: Progress in Embodied AI has made it possible for end-to-end-trained agents to navigate in photo-realistic environments with high-level reasoning and zero-shot or language-conditioned behavior, but benchmarks are still dominated by simulation. In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

- **Summary**: Joint audio-video (AV) generation is still a significant challenge in generative AI, primarily due to three critical requirements: quality of the generated samples, seamless multimodal synchronization and temporal coherence, with audio tracks that match the visual data and vice versa, and limitless video duration. In this paper, we present $^R$-FLAV, a novel transformer-based architecture that addresses all the key challenges of AV generation. We explore three distinct cross modality interaction modules, with our lightweight temporal fusion module emerging as the most effective and computationally efficient approach for aligning audio and visual modalities. Our experimental results demonstrate that $^R$-FLAV outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in multimodal AV generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models based on graph neural networks have emerged as a popular approach for solving computer vision problems. They encode the image into a graph structure and can be beneficial for efficiently capturing the long-range dependencies typically present in remote sensing imagery. However, an important drawback of these methods is their black-box nature which may hamper their wider usage in critical applications. In this work, we tackle the self-interpretability of the graph-based vision models by proposing our Interpretable Window Vision GNN (i-WiViG) approach, which provides explanations by automatically identifying the relevant subgraphs for the model prediction. This is achieved with window-based image graph processing that constrains the node receptive field to a local image region and by using a self-interpretable graph bottleneck that ranks the importance of the long-range relations between the image regions. We evaluate our approach to remote sensing classification and regression tasks, showing it achieves competitive performance while providing inherent and faithful explanations through the identified relations. Further, the quantitative evaluation reveals that our model reduces the infidelity of post-hoc explanations compared to other Vision GNN models, without sacrificing explanation sparsity.

Promising results, up to 89% accuracy are achieved, suggesting that it is possible to recognize if an AI model has been trained with specific data. Finally, we present a MINT platform as demonstrator of this technology aimed to promote transparency in AI training.

- **Summary**: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have transformed the approach to fine-tuning large models for downstream tasks by enabling the adjustment of significantly fewer parameters than those in the original model matrices. In this work, we study the "very low rank regime", where we fine-tune the lowest amount of parameters per linear layer for each considered PEFT method. We propose 1LoRA (Summation Low-Rank Adaptation), a compute, parameter and memory efficient fine-tuning method which uses the feature sum as fixed compression and a single trainable vector as decompression. Differently from state-of-the-art PEFT methods like LoRA, VeRA, and the recent MoRA, 1LoRA uses fewer parameters per layer, reducing the memory footprint and the computational cost. We extensively evaluate our method against state-of-the-art PEFT methods on multiple fine-tuning tasks, and show that our method not only outperforms them, but is also more parameter, memory and computationally efficient. Moreover, thanks to its memory efficiency, 1LoRA allows to fine-tune more evenly across layers, instead of focusing on specific ones (e.g. attention layers), improving performance further.

- **Summary**: Learning multimodal video understanding typically relies on datasets comprising video clips paired with manually annotated captions. However, this becomes even more challenging when dealing with long-form videos, lasting from minutes to hours, in educational and news domains due to the need for more annotators with subject expertise. Hence, there arises a need for automated solutions. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to capture concise and informative content that allows the comprehension of entire videos by leveraging Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies. ASR provides textual content from audio, while OCR extracts textual content from specific frames. This paper introduces a dataset comprising long-form lectures and news videos. We present baseline approaches to understand their limitations on this dataset and advocate for exploring prompt engineering techniques to comprehend long-form multimodal video datasets comprehensively.

- **Summary**: Embodied outdoor scene understanding forms the foundation for autonomous agents to perceive, analyze, and react to dynamic driving environments. However, existing 3D understanding is predominantly based on 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), collecting and processing limited scene-aware contexts. Instead, compared to the 2D planar visual information, point cloud sensors like LiDAR offer rich depth information and fine-grained 3D representations of objects. Meanwhile, the emerging 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is capable of detecting the motion trend, velocity, and reflection intensity of each object. Therefore, the integration of these two modalities provides more flexible querying conditions for natural language, enabling more accurate 3D visual grounding. To this end, in this paper, we exploratively propose a novel method called TPCNet, the first outdoor 3D visual grounding model upon the paradigm of prompt-guided point cloud sensor combination, including both LiDAR and radar contexts. To adaptively balance the features of these two sensors required by the prompt, we have designed a multi-fusion paradigm called Two-Stage Heterogeneous Modal Adaptive Fusion. Specifically, this paradigm initially employs Bidirectional Agent Cross-Attention (BACA), which feeds dual-sensor features, characterized by global receptive fields, to the text features for querying. Additionally, we have designed a Dynamic Gated Graph Fusion (DGGF) module to locate the regions of interest identified by the queries. To further enhance accuracy, we innovatively devise an C3D-RECHead, based on the nearest object edge. Our experiments have demonstrated that our TPCNet, along with its individual modules, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both the Talk2Radar and Talk2Car datasets.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has significantly advanced PET image re-construction, achieving remarkable improvements in image quality through direct training on sinogram or image data. Traditional methods often utilize masks for inpainting tasks, but their incorporation into PET reconstruction frameworks introduces transformative potential. In this study, we pro-pose an advanced PET reconstruction framework called Diffusion tRansformer mEets rAndom Masks (DREAM). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate mask mechanisms into both the sinogram domain and the latent space, pioneering their role in PET reconstruction and demonstrating their ability to enhance reconstruction fidelity and efficiency. The framework employs a high-dimensional stacking approach, transforming masked data from two to three dimensions to expand the solution space and enable the model to capture richer spatial rela-tionships. Additionally, a mask-driven latent space is de-signed to accelerate the diffusion process by leveraging sinogram-driven and mask-driven compact priors, which reduce computational complexity while preserving essen-tial data characteristics. A hierarchical masking strategy is also introduced, guiding the model from focusing on fi-ne-grained local details in the early stages to capturing broader global patterns over time. This progressive ap-proach ensures a balance between detailed feature preservation and comprehensive context understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that DREAM not only improves the overall quality of reconstructed PET images but also preserves critical clinical details, highlighting its potential to advance PET imaging technology. By inte-grating compact priors and hierarchical masking, DREAM offers a promising and efficient avenue for future research and application in PET imaging.

- **Summary**: Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) stand out in various tasks but still struggle with hallucinations. While recent training-free mitigation methods mostly introduce additional inference overhead via retrospection strategy and contrastive decoding, we propose attention reallocation (AttnReal) to mitigate hallucinations with nearly zero extra cost. Our approach is motivated by the key observations that, MLLM's unreasonable attention distribution causes features to be dominated by historical output tokens, which further contributes to hallucinated responses because of the distribution gap between different token types. Based on the observations, AttnReal recycles excessive attention from output tokens and reallocates it to visual tokens, which reduces MLLM's reliance on language priors and ensures the decoding process depends more on the visual inputs. More interestingly, we find that, by controlling the intensity of AttnReal, we can achieve a wide-range trade-off between the response faithfulness and overall performance. Comprehensive results from different benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AttnReal across six open-source MLLMs and three decoding strategies.

- **Summary**: Environment understanding in egocentric videos is an important step for applications like robotics, augmented reality and assistive technologies. These videos are characterized by dynamic interactions and a strong dependence on the wearer engagement with the environment. Traditional approaches often focus on isolated clips or fail to integrate rich semantic and geometric information, limiting scene comprehension. We introduce Dynamic Image-Video Feature Fields (DIV FF), a framework that decomposes the egocentric scene into persistent, dynamic, and actor based components while integrating both image and video language features. Our model enables detailed segmentation, captures affordances, understands the surroundings and maintains consistent understanding over time. DIV-FF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in dynamically evolving scenarios, demonstrating its potential to advance long term, spatio temporal scene understanding.

- **Summary**: As recent text-conditioned diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality images, concerns over their potential misuse have also grown. This issue is critical in the medical domain, where text-conditioned generated medical images could enable insurance fraud or falsified records, highlighting the urgent need for reliable safeguards against unethical use. While watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution in general image domains, their direct application to medical imaging presents significant challenges. A key challenge is preserving fine-grained disease manifestations, as even minor distortions from a watermark may lead to clinical misinterpretation, which compromises diagnostic integrity. To overcome this gap, we present MedSign, a deep learning-based watermarking framework specifically designed for text-to-medical image synthesis, which preserves pathologically significant regions by adaptively adjusting watermark strength. Specifically, we generate a pathology localization map using cross-attention between medical text tokens and the diffusion denoising network, aggregating token-wise attention across layers, heads, and time steps. Leveraging this map, we optimize the LDM decoder to incorporate watermarking during image synthesis, ensuring cohesive integration while minimizing interference in diagnostically critical regions. Experimental results show that our MedSign preserves diagnostic integrity while ensuring watermark robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image quality and detection accuracy on MIMIC-CXR and OIA-ODIR datasets.

- **Summary**: 3D classification with point cloud input is a fundamental problem in 3D vision. However, due to the discrete nature and the insufficient material description of point cloud representations, there are ambiguities in distinguishing wire-like and flat surfaces, as well as transparent or reflective objects. To address these issues, we propose Gaussian Splatting (GS) point cloud-based 3D classification. We find that the scale and rotation coefficients in the GS point cloud help characterize surface types. Specifically, wire-like surfaces consist of multiple slender Gaussian ellipsoids, while flat surfaces are composed of a few flat Gaussian ellipsoids. Additionally, the opacity in the GS point cloud represents the transparency characteristics of objects. As a result, ambiguities in point cloud-based 3D classification can be mitigated utilizing GS point cloud as input. To verify the effectiveness of GS point cloud input, we construct the first real-world GS point cloud dataset in the community, which includes 20 categories with 200 objects in each category. Experiments not only validate the superiority of GS point cloud input, especially in distinguishing ambiguous objects, but also demonstrate the generalization ability across different classification methods.

- **Summary**: Recent image generation schemes typically capture image distribution in a pre-constructed latent space relying on a frozen image tokenizer. Though the performance of tokenizer plays an essential role to the successful generation, its current evaluation metrics (e.g. rFID) fail to precisely assess the tokenizer and correlate its performance to the generation quality (e.g. gFID). In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the reason for the discrepancy of reconstruction and generation qualities in a discrete latent space, and, from which, we propose a novel plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme to facilitate latent space construction. Specifically, a latent perturbation approach is proposed to simulate sampling noises, i.e., the unexpected tokens sampled, from the generative process. With the latent perturbation, we further propose (1) a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, i.e., pFID, which successfully correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality and (2) a plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the robustness of tokenizer thus boosting the generation quality and convergence speed. Extensive benchmarking are conducted with 11 advanced discrete image tokenizers with 2 autoregressive generation models to validate our approach. The tokenizer trained with our proposed latent perturbation achieve a notable 1.60 gFID with classifier-free guidance (CFG) and 3.45 gFID without CFG with a $\sim$400M generator.

- **Summary**: Existing polygonal surface reconstruction methods heavily depend on input completeness and struggle with incomplete point clouds. We argue that while current point cloud completion techniques may recover missing points, they are not optimized for polygonal surface reconstruction, where the parametric representation of underlying surfaces remains overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce parametric completion, a novel paradigm for point cloud completion, which recovers parametric primitives instead of individual points to convey high-level geometric structures. Our presented approach, PaCo, enables high-quality polygonal surface reconstruction by leveraging plane proxies that encapsulate both plane parameters and inlier points, proving particularly effective in challenging scenarios with highly incomplete data. Comprehensive evaluations of our approach on the ABC dataset establish its effectiveness with superior performance and set a new standard for polygonal surface reconstruction from incomplete data.

- **Summary**: Occlusion is one of the fundamental challenges in crowd counting. In the community, various data-driven approaches have been developed to address this issue, yet their effectiveness is limited. This is mainly because most existing crowd counting datasets on which the methods are trained are based on passive cameras, restricting their ability to fully sense the environment. Recently, embodied navigation methods have shown significant potential in precise object detection in interactive scenes. These methods incorporate active camera settings, holding promise in addressing the fundamental issues in crowd counting. However, most existing methods are designed for indoor navigation, showing unknown performance in analyzing complex object distribution in large scale scenes, such as crowds. Besides, most existing embodied navigation datasets are indoor scenes with limited scale and object quantity, preventing them from being introduced into dense crowd analysis. Based on this, a novel task, Embodied Crowd Counting (ECC), is proposed. We first build up an interactive simulator, Embodied Crowd Counting Dataset (ECCD), which enables large scale scenes and large object quantity. A prior probability distribution that approximates realistic crowd distribution is introduced to generate crowds. Then, a zero-shot navigation method (ZECC) is proposed. This method contains a MLLM driven coarse-to-fine navigation mechanism, enabling active Z-axis exploration, and a normal-line-based crowd distribution analysis method for fine counting. Experimental results against baselines show that the proposed method achieves the best trade-off between counting accuracy and navigation cost.

- **Summary**: Prompt tuning of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP, has demonstrated the ability to rapidly adapt to various downstream tasks. However, recent studies indicate that tuned VLMs may suffer from the problem of spurious correlations, where the model relies on spurious features (e.g. background and gender) in the data. This may lead to the model having worse robustness in out-of-distribution data. Standard methods for eliminating spurious correlation typically require us to know the spurious attribute labels of each sample, which is hard in the real world. In this work, we explore improving the group robustness of prompt tuning in VLMs without relying on manual annotation of spurious features. We notice the zero - shot image recognition ability of VLMs and use this ability to identify spurious features, thus avoiding the cost of manual annotation. By leveraging pseudo-spurious attribute annotations, we further propose a method to automatically adjust the training weights of different groups. Extensive experiments show that our approach efficiently improves the worst-group accuracy on CelebA, Waterbirds, and MetaShift datasets, achieving the best robustness gap between the worst-group accuracy and the overall accuracy.

- **Summary**: This paper presents Ev-Layout, a novel large-scale event-based multi-modal dataset designed for indoor layout estimation and tracking. Ev-Layout makes key contributions to the community by: Utilizing a hybrid data collection platform (with a head-mounted display and VR interface) that integrates both RGB and bio-inspired event cameras to capture indoor layouts in motion. Incorporating time-series data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and ambient lighting conditions recorded during data collection to highlight the potential impact of motion speed and lighting on layout estimation accuracy. The dataset consists of 2.5K sequences, including over 771.3K RGB images and 10 billion event data points. Of these, 39K images are annotated with indoor layouts, enabling research in both event-based and video-based indoor layout estimation. Based on the dataset, we propose an event-based layout estimation pipeline with a novel event-temporal distribution feature module to effectively aggregate the spatio-temporal information from events. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal feature fusion module that can be easily integrated into a transformer module for fusion purposes. Finally, we conduct benchmarking and extensive experiments on the Ev-Layout dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of dynamic indoor layout estimation compared to existing event-based methods.

- **Summary**: Accurate and efficient 3D segmentation is essential for both clinical and research applications. While foundation models like SAM have revolutionized interactive segmentation, their 2D design and domain shift limitations make them ill-suited for 3D medical images. Current adaptations address some of these challenges but remain limited, either lacking volumetric awareness, offering restricted interactivity, or supporting only a small set of structures and modalities. Usability also remains a challenge, as current tools are rarely integrated into established imaging platforms and often rely on cumbersome web-based interfaces with restricted functionality. We introduce nnInteractive, the first comprehensive 3D interactive open-set segmentation method. It supports diverse prompts-including points, scribbles, boxes, and a novel lasso prompt-while leveraging intuitive 2D interactions to generate full 3D segmentations. Trained on 120+ diverse volumetric 3D datasets (CT, MRI, PET, 3D Microscopy, etc.), nnInteractive sets a new state-of-the-art in accuracy, adaptability, and usability. Crucially, it is the first method integrated into widely used image viewers (e.g., Napari, MITK), ensuring broad accessibility for real-world clinical and research applications. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that nnInteractive far surpasses existing methods, setting a new standard for AI-driven interactive 3D segmentation. nnInteractive is publicly available: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/napari-nninteractive (Napari plugin), https://www.mitk.org/MITK-nnInteractive (MITK integration), https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnInteractive (Python backend).

- **Summary**: Image tokenization has significantly advanced visual generation and multimodal modeling, particularly when paired with autoregressive models. However, current methods face challenges in balancing efficiency and fidelity: high-resolution image reconstruction either requires an excessive number of tokens or compromises critical details through token reduction. To resolve this, we propose Latent Consistency Tokenizer (Layton) that bridges discrete visual tokens with the compact latent space of pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling efficient representation of 1024x1024 images using only 256 tokens-a 16 times compression over VQGAN. Layton integrates a transformer encoder, a quantized codebook, and a latent consistency decoder. Direct application of LDM as the decoder results in color and brightness discrepancies. Thus, we convert it to latent consistency decoder, reducing multi-step sampling to 1-2 steps for direct pixel-level supervision. Experiments demonstrate Layton's superiority in high-fidelity reconstruction, with 10.8 reconstruction Frechet Inception Distance on MSCOCO-2017 5K benchmark for 1024x1024 image reconstruction. We also extend Layton to a text-to-image generation model, LaytonGen, working in autoregression. It achieves 0.73 score on GenEval benchmark, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We present the first large reconstruction model, Twinner, capable of recovering a scene's illumination as well as an object's geometry and material properties from only a few posed images. Twinner is based on the Large Reconstruction Model and innovates in three key ways: 1) We introduce a memory-efficient voxel-grid transformer whose memory scales only quadratically with the size of the voxel grid. 2) To deal with scarcity of high-quality ground-truth PBR-shaded models, we introduce a large fully-synthetic dataset of procedurally-generated PBR-textured objects lit with varied illumination. 3) To narrow the synthetic-to-real gap, we finetune the model on real life datasets by means of a differentiable physically-based shading model, eschewing the need for ground-truth illumination or material properties which are challenging to obtain in real life. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model on the real life StanfordORB benchmark where, given few input views, we achieve reconstruction quality significantly superior to existing feedforward reconstruction networks, and comparable to significantly slower per-scene optimization methods.

- **Summary**: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have succeeded remarkably in histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis. However, most MIL models only offer attention-based explanations that do not faithfully capture the model's decision mechanism and do not allow human-model interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoMIL, an inherently interpretable MIL model for WSI analysis that offers user-friendly explanations and supports human intervention. Our approach employs a sparse autoencoder to discover human-interpretable concepts from the image feature space, which are then used to train ProtoMIL. The model represents predictions as linear combinations of concepts, making the decision process transparent. Furthermore, ProtoMIL allows users to perform model interventions by altering the input concepts. Experiments on two widely used pathology datasets demonstrate that ProtoMIL achieves a classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art MIL models while offering intuitively understandable explanations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can eliminate reliance on diagnostically irrelevant information via human intervention, guiding the model toward being right for the right reason. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/ss-sun/ProtoMIL.

- **Summary**: Scene text editing aims to modify text content within scene images while maintaining style consistency. Traditional methods achieve this by explicitly disentangling style and content from the source image and then fusing the style with the target content, while ensuring content consistency using a pre-trained recognition model. Despite notable progress, these methods suffer from complex pipelines, leading to suboptimal performance in complex scenarios. In this work, we introduce Recognition-Synergistic Scene Text Editing (RS-STE), a novel approach that fully exploits the intrinsic synergy of text recognition for editing. Our model seamlessly integrates text recognition with text editing within a unified framework, and leverages the recognition model's ability to implicitly disentangle style and content while ensuring content consistency. Specifically, our approach employs a multi-modal parallel decoder based on transformer architecture, which predicts both text content and stylized images in parallel. Additionally, our cyclic self-supervised fine-tuning strategy enables effective training on unpaired real-world data without ground truth, enhancing style and content consistency through a twice-cyclic generation process. Built on a relatively simple architecture, \mymodel achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and further demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging the generated hard cases to boost the performance of downstream recognition tasks.

- **Summary**: Artistic style transfer aims to transfer the learned style onto an arbitrary content image. However, most existing style transfer methods can only render consistent artistic stylized images, making it difficult for users to get enough stylized images to enjoy. To solve this issue, we propose a novel artistic style transfer framework called DyArtbank, which can generate diverse and highly realistic artistic stylized images. Specifically, we introduce a Dynamic Style Prompt ArtBank (DSPA), a set of learnable parameters. It can learn and store the style information from the collection of artworks, dynamically guiding pre-trained stable diffusion to generate diverse and highly realistic artistic stylized images. DSPA can also generate random artistic image samples with the learned style information, providing a new idea for data augmentation. Besides, a Key Content Feature Prompt (KCFP) module is proposed to provide sufficient content prompts for pre-trained stable diffusion to preserve the detailed structure of the input content image. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. Code is available: https://github.com/Jamie-Cheung/DyArtbank

- **Summary**: Recent advances in interactive 3D segmentation from 2D images have demonstrated impressive performance. However, current models typically require extensive scene-specific training to accurately reconstruct and segment objects, which limits their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we introduce WildSeg3D, an efficient approach that enables the segmentation of arbitrary 3D objects across diverse environments using a feed-forward mechanism. A key challenge of this feed-forward approach lies in the accumulation of 3D alignment errors across multiple 2D views, which can lead to inaccurate 3D segmentation results. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Global Aligning (DGA), a technique that improves the accuracy of global multi-view alignment by focusing on difficult-to-match 3D points across images, using a dynamic adjustment function. Additionally, for real-time interactive segmentation, we introduce Multi-view Group Mapping (MGM), a method that utilizes an object mask cache to integrate multi-view segmentations and respond rapidly to user prompts. WildSeg3D demonstrates robust generalization across arbitrary scenes, thereby eliminating the need for scene-specific training. Specifically, WildSeg3D not only attains the accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods but also achieves a $40\times$ speedup compared to existing SOTA models. Our code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advancements in learning-based motion in-betweening, a key limitation has been overlooked: the requirement for character-specific datasets. In this work, we introduce AnyMoLe, a novel method that addresses this limitation by leveraging video diffusion models to generate motion in-between frames for arbitrary characters without external data. Our approach employs a two-stage frame generation process to enhance contextual understanding. Furthermore, to bridge the domain gap between real-world and rendered character animations, we introduce ICAdapt, a fine-tuning technique for video diffusion models. Additionally, we propose a ``motion-video mimicking'' optimization technique, enabling seamless motion generation for characters with arbitrary joint structures using 2D and 3D-aware features. AnyMoLe significantly reduces data dependency while generating smooth and realistic transitions, making it applicable to a wide range of motion in-betweening tasks.

- **Summary**: Objective. This paper presents an overview of generalizable and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in deep learning (DL) for medical imaging, aimed at addressing the urgent need for transparency and explainability in clinical applications.   Methodology. We propose to use four CNNs in three medical datasets (brain tumor, skin cancer, and chest x-ray) for medical image classification tasks. In addition, we perform paired t-tests to show the significance of the differences observed between different methods. Furthermore, we propose to combine ResNet50 with five common XAI techniques to obtain explainable results for model prediction, aiming at improving model transparency. We also involve a quantitative metric (confidence increase) to evaluate the usefulness of XAI techniques.   Key findings. The experimental results indicate that ResNet50 can achieve feasible accuracy and F1 score in all datasets (e.g., 86.31\% accuracy in skin cancer). Furthermore, the findings show that while certain XAI methods, such as XgradCAM, effectively highlight relevant abnormal regions in medical images, others, like EigenGradCAM, may perform less effectively in specific scenarios. In addition, XgradCAM indicates higher confidence increase (e.g., 0.12 in glioma tumor) compared to GradCAM++ (0.09) and LayerCAM (0.08).   Implications. Based on the experimental results and recent advancements, we outline future research directions to enhance the robustness and generalizability of DL models in the field of biomedical imaging.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised 3D object detection serves as an important solution for offline 3D object annotation. However, due to the data sparsity and limited views, the clustering-based label fitting in unsupervised object detection often generates low-quality pseudo-labels. Multi-agent collaborative dataset, which involves the sharing of complementary observations among agents, holds the potential to break through this bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method that learns to Detect Objects from Multi-Agent LiDAR scans, termed DOtA, without using labels from external. DOtA first uses the internally shared ego-pose and ego-shape of collaborative agents to initialize the detector, leveraging the generalization performance of neural networks to infer preliminary labels. Subsequently,DOtA uses the complementary observations between agents to perform multi-scale encoding on preliminary labels, then decodes high-quality and low-quality labels. These labels are further used as prompts to guide a correct feature learning process, thereby enhancing the performance of the unsupervised object detection task. Extensive experiments on the V2V4Real and OPV2V datasets show that our DOtA outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised 3D object detection methods. Additionally, we also validate the effectiveness of the DOtA labels under various collaborative perception frameworks.The code is available at https://github.com/xmuqimingxia/DOtA.

- **Summary**: Deep-learning-based autonomous driving (AD) perception introduces a promising picture for safe and environment-friendly transportation. However, the over-reliance on real labeled data in LiDAR perception limits the scale of on-road attempts. 3D real world data is notoriously time-and-energy-consuming to annotate and lacks corner cases like rare traffic participants. On the contrary, in simulators like CARLA, generating labeled LiDAR point clouds with corner cases is a piece of cake. However, introducing synthetic point clouds to improve real perception is non-trivial. This stems from two challenges: 1) sample efficiency of simulation datasets 2) simulation-to-real gaps. To overcome both challenges, we propose a plug-and-play method called JiSAM , shorthand for Jittering augmentation, domain-aware backbone and memory-based Sectorized AlignMent. In extensive experiments conducted on the famous AD dataset NuScenes, we demonstrate that, with SOTA 3D object detector, JiSAM is able to utilize the simulation data and only labels on 2.5% available real data to achieve comparable performance to models trained on all real data. Additionally, JiSAM achieves more than 15 mAPs on the objects not labeled in the real training set. We will release models and codes.

- **Summary**: Recently, Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) have achieved impressive reconstruction quality in the field of image Compressive Sensing (CS) by unfolding iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks. The reconstruction quality of DUNs depends on the learned prior knowledge, so introducing stronger prior knowledge can further improve reconstruction quality. On the other hand, pre-trained diffusion models contain powerful prior knowledge and have a solid theoretical foundation and strong scalability, but it requires a large number of iterative steps to achieve reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to use the powerful prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model in DUNs to achieve high-quality reconstruction with less steps for image CS. Specifically, we first design an iterative optimization algorithm named Diffusion Message Passing (DMP), which embeds a pre-trained diffusion model into each iteration process of DMP. Then, we deeply unfold the DMP algorithm into a neural network named DMP-DUN. The proposed DMP-DUN can use lightweight neural networks to achieve mapping from measurement data to the intermediate steps of the reverse diffusion process and directly approximate the divergence of the diffusion model, thereby further improving reconstruction efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our proposed DMP-DUN achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires at least only 2 steps to reconstruct the image.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image models have revolutionized creative fields by generating visually captivating outputs from textual prompts; however, while traditional photography offers precise control over camera settings to shape visual aesthetics -- such as depth-of-field -- current diffusion models typically rely on prompt engineering to mimic such effects. This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently altering the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. By grounding depth-of-field adjustments, our method preserves the underlying scene structure as the level of blur is varied. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves flexible, lens-like blur control but also supports applications such as real image editing via inversion.

- **Summary**: The recent surge in the vehicle market has led to an alarming increase in road accidents. This underscores the critical importance of enhancing road safety measures, particularly for vulnerable road users like motorcyclists. Hence, we introduce the rider intention prediction (RIP) competition that aims to address challenges in rider safety by proactively predicting maneuvers before they occur, thereby strengthening rider safety. This capability enables the riders to react to the potential incorrect maneuvers flagged by advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). We collect a new dataset, namely, rider action anticipation dataset (RAAD) for the competition consisting of two tasks: single-view RIP and multi-view RIP. The dataset incorporates a spectrum of traffic conditions and challenging navigational maneuvers on roads with varying lighting conditions. For the competition, we received seventy-five registrations and five team submissions for inference of which we compared the methods of the top three performing teams on both the RIP tasks: one state-space model (Mamba2) and two learning-based approaches (SVM and CNN-LSTM). The results indicate that the state-space model outperformed the other methods across the entire dataset, providing a balanced performance across maneuver classes. The SVM-based RIP method showed the second-best performance when using random sampling and SMOTE. However, the CNN-LSTM method underperformed, primarily due to class imbalance issues, particularly struggling with minority classes. This paper details the proposed RAAD dataset and provides a summary of the submissions for the RIP 2024 competition.

- **Summary**: Instead of performing text-conditioned denoising in the image domain, latent diffusion models (LDMs) operate in latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE), enabling more efficient processing at reduced computational costs. However, while the diffusion process has moved to the latent space, the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models, as used in many image processing tasks, still operate in pixel space. Doing so requires costly VAE-decoding of latent images before they can be processed. In this paper, we introduce Latent-CLIP, a CLIP model that operates directly in the latent space. We train Latent-CLIP on 2.7B pairs of latent images and descriptive texts, and show that it matches zero-shot classification performance of similarly sized CLIP models on both the ImageNet benchmark and a LDM-generated version of it, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing both real and generated content. Furthermore, we construct Latent-CLIP rewards for reward-based noise optimization (ReNO) and show that they match the performance of their CLIP counterparts on GenEval and T2I-CompBench while cutting the cost of the total pipeline by 21%. Finally, we use Latent-CLIP to guide generation away from harmful content, achieving strong performance on the inappropriate image prompts (I2P) benchmark and a custom evaluation, without ever requiring the costly step of decoding intermediate images.

- **Summary**: Data visualization of aggregation queries is one of the most common ways of doing data exploration and data science as it can help identify correlations and patterns in the data. We propose DIVAN, a system that automatically normalizes the one-dimensional axes by frequency to generate large numbers of two-dimensional visualizations. DIVAN normalizes the input data via binning to allocate more pixels to data values that appear more frequently in the dataset. DIVAN can utilize either CPUs or Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architectures to quickly calculate aggregates to support the visualizations. On real world datasets, we show that DIVAN generates visualizations that highlight patterns and correlations, some expected and some unexpected. By using PIM, we can calculate aggregates 45%-64% faster than modern CPUs on large datasets. For use cases with 100 million rows and 32 columns, our system is able to compute 4,960 aggregates (each of size 128x128x128) in about a minute.

- **Summary**: Comprehensive and consistent dynamic scene understanding from camera input is essential for advanced autonomous systems. Traditional camera-based perception tasks like 3D object tracking and semantic occupancy prediction lack either spatial comprehensiveness or temporal consistency. In this work, we introduce a brand-new task, Camera-based 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking, which simultaneously addresses panoptic occupancy segmentation and object tracking from camera-only input. Furthermore, we propose TrackOcc, a cutting-edge approach that processes image inputs in a streaming, end-to-end manner with 4D panoptic queries to address the proposed task. Leveraging the localization-aware loss, TrackOcc enhances the accuracy of 4D panoptic occupancy tracking without bells and whistles. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo dataset. The source code will be released at https://github.com/Tsinghua-MARS-Lab/TrackOcc.

- **Summary**: Privacy concerns around ever increasing number of cameras are increasing in today's digital age. Although existing anonymization methods are able to obscure identity information, they often struggle to preserve the utility of the images. In this work, we introduce a training-free method for face anonymization that preserves key non-identity-related attributes. Our approach utilizes a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model without requiring optimization or training. It begins by inverting the input image to recover its initial noise. The noise is then denoised through an identity-conditioned diffusion process, where modified identity embeddings ensure the anonymized face is distinct from the original identity. Our approach also supports localized anonymization, giving users control over which facial regions are anonymized or kept intact. Comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art methods show our approach excels in anonymization, attribute preservation, and image quality. Its flexibility, robustness, and practicality make it well-suited for real-world applications. Code and data can be found at https://github.com/hanweikung/nullface .

- **Summary**: Understanding the environment and a robot's physical reachability is crucial for task execution. While state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) excel in environmental perception, they often generate inaccurate or impractical responses in embodied visual reasoning tasks due to a lack of understanding of robotic physical reachability. To address this issue, we propose a unified representation of physical reachability across diverse robots, i.e., Space-Physical Reachability Map (S-P Map), and PhysVLM, a vision-language model that integrates this reachability information into visual reasoning. Specifically, the S-P Map abstracts a robot's physical reachability into a generalized spatial representation, independent of specific robot configurations, allowing the model to focus on reachability features rather than robot-specific parameters. Subsequently, PhysVLM extends traditional VLM architectures by incorporating an additional feature encoder to process the S-P Map, enabling the model to reason about physical reachability without compromising its general vision-language capabilities. To train and evaluate PhysVLM, we constructed a large-scale multi-robot dataset, Phys100K, and a challenging benchmark, EQA-phys, which includes tasks for six different robots in both simulated and real-world environments. Experimental results demonstrate that PhysVLM outperforms existing models, achieving a 14\% improvement over GPT-4o on EQA-phys and surpassing advanced embodied VLMs such as RoboMamba and SpatialVLM on the RoboVQA-val and OpenEQA benchmarks. Additionally, the S-P Map shows strong compatibility with various VLMs, and its integration into GPT-4o-mini yields a 7.1\% performance improvement.

- **Summary**: Outdoor thermal comfort is a critical determinant of urban livability, particularly in hot desert climates where extreme heat poses challenges to public health, energy consumption, and urban planning. Mean Radiant Temperature ($T_{mrt}$) is a key parameter for evaluating outdoor thermal comfort, especially in urban environments where radiation dynamics significantly impact human thermal exposure. Traditional methods of estimating $T_{mrt}$ rely on field measurements and computational simulations, both of which are resource intensive. This study introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach that integrates shortwave and longwave radiation modeling with deep learning techniques. By leveraging a multimodal dataset that includes meteorological data, built environment characteristics, and fisheye image-derived shading information, our model enhances predictive accuracy while maintaining physical consistency. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PINN framework outperforms conventional deep learning models, with the best-performing configurations achieving an RMSE of 3.50 and an $R^2$ of 0.88. This approach highlights the potential of physics-informed machine learning in bridging the gap between computational modeling and real-world applications, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for urban thermal comfort assessments.

- **Summary**: Current 3D stylization techniques primarily focus on static scenes, while our world is inherently dynamic, filled with moving objects and changing environments. Existing style transfer methods primarily target appearance -- such as color and texture transformation -- but often neglect the geometric characteristics of the style image, which are crucial for achieving a complete and coherent stylization effect. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose GAS-NeRF, a novel approach for joint appearance and geometry stylization in dynamic Radiance Fields. Our method leverages depth maps to extract and transfer geometric details into the radiance field, followed by appearance transfer. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the stylization quality while maintaining temporal coherence in dynamic scenes.

- **Summary**: The generalization performance of AI-generated image detection remains a critical challenge. Although most existing methods perform well in detecting images from generative models included in the training set, their accuracy drops significantly when faced with images from unseen generators. To address this limitation, we propose a novel detection method based on the fractal self-similarity of the spectrum, a common feature among images generated by different models. Specifically, we demonstrate that AI-generated images exhibit fractal-like spectral growth through periodic extension and low-pass filtering. This observation motivates us to exploit the similarity among different fractal branches of the spectrum. Instead of directly analyzing the spectrum, our method mitigates the impact of varying spectral characteristics across different generators, improving detection performance for images from unseen models. Experiments on a public benchmark demonstrated the generalized detection performance across both GANs and diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised 3D occupancy prediction offers a promising solution for understanding complex driving scenes without requiring costly 3D annotations. However, training dense voxel decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and such models often fail to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or new classes without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-GaussOcc. Our approach incrementally optimizes time-aware 3D Gaussians instantiated from raw sensor streams at runtime, enabling voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolution. Specifically, TT-GaussOcc operates in a "lift-move-voxel" symphony: we first "lift" surrounding-view semantics obtained from 2D vision foundation models (VLMs) to instantiate Gaussians at non-empty 3D space; Next, we "move" dynamic Gaussians from previous frames along estimated Gaussian scene flow to complete appearance and eliminate trailing artifacts of fast-moving objects, while accumulating static Gaussians to enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we mitigate inherent noises in semantic predictions and scene flow vectors by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization, using proposed trilateral RBF kernels that jointly consider color, semantic, and spatial affinities. The historical static and current dynamic Gaussians are then combined and voxelized to generate occupancy prediction. Extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft with varying voxel resolutions demonstrate that TT-GaussOcc surpasses self-supervised baselines by 46% on mIoU without any offline training, and supports finer voxel resolutions at 2.6 FPS inference speed.

- **Summary**: It has been a longstanding goal within image captioning to move beyond a dependence on object detection. We investigate using superpixels coupled with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between detector-based captioning architectures and those that solely pretrain on large datasets. Our novel superpixel approach ensures that the model receives object-like features whilst the use of VLMs provides our model with open set object understanding. Furthermore, we extend our architecture to make use of multi-resolution inputs, allowing our model to view images in different levels of detail, and use an attention mechanism to determine which parts are most relevant to the caption. We demonstrate our model's performance with multiple VLMs and through a range of ablations detailing the impact of different architectural choices. Our full model achieves a competitive CIDEr score of $136.9$ on the COCO Karpathy split.

- **Summary**: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential for transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, diminishing their performance on new tasks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Representation Learning (MMRL) framework that introduces a shared, learnable, and modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL projects the space tokens to text and image representation tokens, facilitating more effective multi-modal interactions. Unlike previous approaches that solely optimize class token features, MMRL integrates representation tokens at higher layers of the encoders--where dataset-specific features are more prominent--while preserving generalized knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both representation and class features are optimized, with trainable projection layer applied to the representation tokens, whereas the class token projection layer remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. Furthermore, a regularization term is introduced to align the class features and text features with the zero-shot features from the frozen VLM, thereby safeguarding the model's generalization capacity. For inference, a decoupling strategy is employed, wherein both representation and class features are utilized for base classes, while only the class features, which retain more generalized knowledge, are used for new tasks. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a balanced trade-off between task-specific adaptation and generalization.

- **Summary**: Change detection is a crucial and widely applied task in remote sensing, aimed at identifying and analyzing changes occurring in the same geographical area over time. Due to variability in acquisition conditions, bi-temporal remote sensing images often exhibit significant differences in image style. Even with the powerful generalization capabilities of DNNs, these unpredictable style variations between bi-temporal images inevitably affect model's ability to accurately detect changed areas. To address issue above, we propose the Content Focuser Network (CFNet), which takes content-aware strategy as a key insight. CFNet employs EfficientNet-B5 as the backbone for feature extraction. To enhance the model's focus on the content features of images while mitigating the misleading effects of style features, we develop a constraint strategy that prioritizes the content features of bi-temporal images, termed Content-Aware. Furthermore, to enable the model to flexibly focus on changed and unchanged areas according to the requirements of different stages, we design a reweighting module based on the cosine distance between bi-temporal image features, termed Focuser. CFNet achieve outstanding performance across three well-known change detection datasets: CLCD (F1: 81.41%, IoU: 68.65%), LEVIR-CD (F1: 92.18%, IoU: 85.49%), and SYSU-CD (F1: 82.89%, IoU: 70.78%). The code and pretrained models of CFNet are publicly released at https://github.com/wifiBlack/CFNet.

- **Summary**: Humans are undoubtedly the most important participants in computer vision, and the ability to detect any individual given a natural language description, a task we define as referring to any person, holds substantial practical value. However, we find that existing models generally fail to achieve real-world usability, and current benchmarks are limited by their focus on one-to-one referring, that hinder progress in this area. In this work, we revisit this task from three critical perspectives: task definition, dataset design, and model architecture. We first identify five aspects of referable entities and three distinctive characteristics of this task. Next, we introduce HumanRef, a novel dataset designed to tackle these challenges and better reflect real-world applications. From a model design perspective, we integrate a multimodal large language model with an object detection framework, constructing a robust referring model named RexSeek. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models, which perform well on commonly used benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g, struggle with HumanRef due to their inability to detect multiple individuals. In contrast, RexSeek not only excels in human referring but also generalizes effectively to common object referring, making it broadly applicable across various perception tasks.

- **Summary**: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables learning systems to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. With the advancement of pre-training, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) offers a promising starting point for CIL. However, CLIP makes decisions by matching visual embeddings to class names, overlooking the rich contextual information conveyed through language. For instance, the concept of ``cat'' can be decomposed into features like tail, fur, and face for recognition. Besides, since the model is continually updated, these detailed features are overwritten in CIL, requiring external knowledge for compensation. In this paper, we introduce ExterNal knowledGe INjEction (ENGINE) for CLIP-based CIL. To enhance knowledge transfer from outside the dataset, we propose a dual-branch injection tuning framework that encodes informative knowledge from both visual and textual modalities. The visual branch is enhanced with data augmentation to enrich the visual features, while the textual branch leverages GPT-4 to rewrite discriminative descriptors. In addition to this on-the-fly knowledge injection, we also implement post-tuning knowledge by re-ranking the prediction results during inference. With the injected knowledge, the model can better capture informative features for downstream tasks as data evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ENGINE.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves impressive rendering fidelity and speed for novel view synthesis. However, its substantial data size poses a significant challenge for practical applications. While many compression techniques have been proposed, they fail to efficiently utilize existing bitstreams in on-demand applications due to their lack of progressivity, leading to a waste of resource. To address this issue, we propose PCGS (Progressive Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting), which adaptively controls both the quantity and quality of Gaussians (or anchors) to enable effective progressivity for on-demand applications. Specifically, for quantity, we introduce a progressive masking strategy that incrementally incorporates new anchors while refining existing ones to enhance fidelity. For quality, we propose a progressive quantization approach that gradually reduces quantization step sizes to achieve finer modeling of Gaussian attributes. Furthermore, to compact the incremental bitstreams, we leverage existing quantization results to refine probability prediction, improving entropy coding efficiency across progressive levels. Overall, PCGS achieves progressivity while maintaining compression performance comparable to SoTA non-progressive methods. Code available at: github.com/YihangChen-ee/PCGS.

- **Summary**: The open vocabulary capability of 3D models is increasingly valued, as traditional methods with models trained with fixed categories fail to recognize unseen objects in complex dynamic 3D scenes. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach, SAS, to integrate the open vocabulary capability of multiple 2D models and migrate it to 3D domain. Specifically, we first propose Model Alignment via Text to map different 2D models into the same embedding space using text as a bridge. Then, we propose Annotation-Free Model Capability Construction to explicitly quantify the 2D model's capability of recognizing different categories using diffusion models. Following this, point cloud features from different 2D models are fused with the guide of constructed model capabilities. Finally, the integrated 2D open vocabulary capability is transferred to 3D domain through feature distillation. SAS outperforms previous methods by a large margin across multiple datasets, including ScanNet v2, Matterport3D, and nuScenes, while its generalizability is further validated on downstream tasks, e.g., gaussian segmentation and instance segmentation.

- **Summary**: Accurate dose calculations in proton therapy rely on high-quality CT images. While planning CTs (pCTs) serve as a reference for dosimetric planning, Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is used throughout Adaptive Radiotherapy (ART) to generate sCTs for improved dose calculations. Despite its lower cost and reduced radiation exposure advantages, CBCT suffers from severe artefacts and poor image quality, making it unsuitable for precise dosimetry. Deep learning-based CBCT-to-CT translation has emerged as a promising approach. Still, existing methods often introduce anatomical inconsistencies and lack reliable uncertainty estimates, limiting their clinical adoption. To bridge this gap, we propose STF-RUE, a novel framework integrating two key components. First, STF, a segmentation-guided CBCT-to-CT translation method that enhances anatomical consistency by leveraging segmentation priors extracted from pCTs. Second, RUE, a conformal prediction method that augments predicted CTs with pixel-wise conformal prediction intervals, providing clinicians with robust reliability indicator. Comprehensive experiments using UNet++ and Fast-DDPM on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that STF-RUE significantly improves translation accuracy, as measured by a novel soft-tissue-focused metric designed for precise dose computation. Additionally, STF-RUE provides better-calibrated uncertainty sets for synthetic CT, reinforcing trust in synthetic CTs. By addressing both anatomical fidelity and uncertainty quantification, STF-RUE marks a crucial step toward safer and more effective adaptive proton therapy.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce a novel high-fidelity 3D head reconstruction method from a single portrait image, regardless of perspective, expression, or accessories. Despite significant efforts in adapting 2D generative models for novel view synthesis and 3D optimization, most methods struggle to produce high-quality 3D portraits. The lack of crucial information, such as identity, expression, hair, and accessories, limits these approaches in generating realistic 3D head models. To address these challenges, we construct a new high-quality dataset containing 227 sequences of digital human portraits captured from 96 different perspectives, totalling 21,792 frames, featuring diverse expressions and accessories. To further improve performance, we integrate identity and expression information into the multi-view diffusion process to enhance facial consistency across views. Specifically, we apply identity- and expression-aware guidance and supervision to extract accurate facial representations, which guide the model and enforce objective functions to ensure high identity and expression consistency during generation. Finally, we generate an orbital video around the portrait consisting of 96 multi-view frames, which can be used for 3D portrait model reconstruction. Our method demonstrates robust performance across challenging scenarios, including side-face angles and complex accessories

- **Summary**: Reinforcement learning with verifiable outcome rewards (RLVR) has effectively scaled up chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GTR significantly enhances the performance and generalization of the LLaVA-7b model across various visual environments, achieving 3-5 times higher task success rates compared to SoTA models with notably smaller model sizes.

- **Summary**: Sign language representation learning presents unique challenges due to the complex spatio-temporal nature of signs and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Existing methods often rely either on models pre-trained on general visual tasks, that lack sign-specific features, or use complex multimodal and multi-branch architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce a scalable, self-supervised framework for sign representation learning. We leverage important inductive (sign) priors during the training of our RGB model. To do this, we leverage simple but important cues based on skeletons while pretraining a masked autoencoder. These sign specific priors alongside feature regularization and an adversarial style agnostic loss provide a powerful backbone. Notably, our model does not require skeletal keypoints during inference, avoiding the limitations of keypoint-based models during downstream tasks. When finetuned, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for sign recognition on the WLASL, ASL-Citizen and NMFs-CSL datasets, using a simpler architecture and with only a single-modality. Beyond recognition, our frozen model excels in sign dictionary retrieval and sign translation, surpassing standard MAE pretraining and skeletal-based representations in retrieval. It also reduces computational costs for training existing sign translation models while maintaining strong performance on Phoenix2014T, CSL-Daily and How2Sign.

- **Summary**: Visual attention plays a critical role when our visual system executes active visual tasks by interacting with the physical scene. However, how to encode the visual object relationship in the psychological world of our brain deserves to be explored. In the field of computer vision, predicting visual fixations or scanpaths is a usual way to explore the visual attention and behaviors of human observers when viewing a scene. Most existing methods encode visual attention using individual fixations or scanpaths based on the raw gaze shift data collected from human observers. This may not capture the common attention pattern well, because without considering the semantic information of the viewed scene, raw gaze shift data alone contain high inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this issue, we propose a new attention representation, called Attention Graph, to simultaneously code the visual saliency and scanpath in a graph-based representation and better reveal the common attention behavior of human observers. In the attention graph, the semantic-based scanpath is defined by the path on the graph, while saliency of objects can be obtained by computing fixation density on each node. Systemic experiments demonstrate that the proposed attention graph combined with our new evaluation metrics provides a better benchmark for evaluating attention prediction methods. Meanwhile, extra experiments demonstrate the promising potentials of the proposed attention graph in assessing human cognitive states, such as autism spectrum disorder screening and age classification.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing imagery from systems such as Sentinel provides full coverage of the Earth's surface at around 10-meter resolution. The remote sensing community has transitioned to extensive use of deep learning models due to their high performance on benchmarks such as the UCMerced and ISPRS Vaihingen datasets. Convolutional models such as UNet and ResNet variations are commonly employed for remote sensing but typically only accept three channels, as they were developed for RGB imagery, while satellite systems provide more than ten. Recently, several transformer architectures have been proposed for remote sensing, but they have not been extensively benchmarked and are typically used on small datasets such as Salinas Valley. Meanwhile, it is becoming feasible to obtain dense spatial land-use labels for entire first-level administrative divisions of some countries. Scaling law observations suggest that substantially larger multi-spectral transformer models could provide a significant leap in remote sensing performance in these settings.   In this work, we propose ChromaFormer, a family of multi-spectral transformer models, which we evaluate across orders of magnitude differences in model parameters to assess their performance and scaling effectiveness on a densely labeled imagery dataset of Flanders, Belgium, covering more than 13,500 km^2 and containing 15 classes. We propose a novel multi-spectral attention strategy and demonstrate its effectiveness through ablations. Furthermore, we show that models many orders of magnitude larger than conventional architectures, such as UNet, lead to substantial accuracy improvements: a UNet++ model with 23M parameters achieves less than 65% accuracy, while a multi-spectral transformer with 655M parameters achieves over 95% accuracy on the Biological Valuation Map of Flanders.

- **Summary**: Manipulation of deformable linear objects (DLOs) in constrained environments is a challenging task. This paper describes a two-layered approach for placing DLOs on a flat surface using a single robot hand. The high-level layer is a novel DLO surface placement method based on Euler's elastica solutions. During this process one DLO endpoint is manipulated by the robot gripper while a variable interior point of the DLO serves as the start point of the portion aligned with the placement surface. The low-level layer forms a pipeline controller. The controller estimates the DLO current shape using a Residual Neural Network (ResNet) and uses low-level feedback to ensure task execution in the presence of modeling and placement errors. The resulting DLO placement approach can recover from states where the high-level manipulation planner has failed as required by practical robot manipulation systems. The DLO placement approach is demonstrated with simulations and experiments that use silicon mock-up objects prepared for fresh food applications.

- **Summary**: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that enables the visualization of biochemical and physiological processes across various tissues. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have demonstrated significant progress in directly mapping sinograms to PET images. However, regression-based DL models often yield overly smoothed reconstructions lacking of details (i.e., low distortion, low perceptual quality), whereas GAN-based and likelihood-based posterior sampling models tend to introduce undesirable artifacts in predictions (i.e., high distortion, high perceptual quality), limiting their clinical applicability. To achieve a robust perception-distortion tradeoff, we propose Posterior-Mean Denoising Diffusion Model (PMDM-PET), a novel approach that builds upon a recently established mathematical theory to explore the closed-form expression of perception-distortion function in diffusion model space for PET image reconstruction from sinograms. Specifically, PMDM-PET first obtained posterior-mean PET predictions under minimum mean square error (MSE), then optimally transports the distribution of them to the ground-truth PET images distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that PMDM-PET not only generates realistic PET images with possible minimum distortion and optimal perceptual quality but also outperforms five recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL baselines in both qualitative visual inspection and quantitative pixel-wise metrics PSNR (dB)/SSIM/NRMSE.

- **Summary**: Significant progress has been made in vision-language models. However, language-conditioned robotic manipulation for contact-rich tasks remains underexplored, particularly in terms of tactile sensing. To address this gap, we introduce the Tactile-Language-Action (TLA) model, which effectively processes sequential tactile feedback via cross-modal language grounding to enable robust policy generation in contact-intensive scenarios. In addition, we construct a comprehensive dataset that contains 24k pairs of tactile action instruction data, customized for fingertip peg-in-hole assembly, providing essential resources for TLA training and evaluation. Our results show that TLA significantly outperforms traditional imitation learning methods (e.g., diffusion policy) in terms of effective action generation and action accuracy, while demonstrating strong generalization capabilities by achieving over 85\% success rate on previously unseen assembly clearances and peg shapes. We publicly release all data and code in the hope of advancing research in language-conditioned tactile manipulation skill learning.

- **Summary**: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have made impressive strides in image captioning, VQA, and video comprehension, yet they still struggle with the intricate temporal and spatial cues found in comics. To address this gap, we introduce ComicsPAP, a large-scale benchmark designed for comic strip understanding. Comprising over 100k samples and organized into 5 subtasks under a Pick-a-Panel framework, ComicsPAP demands models to identify the missing panel in a sequence. Our evaluations, conducted under both multi-image and single-image protocols, reveal that current state-of-the-art LMMs perform near chance on these tasks, underscoring significant limitations in capturing sequential and contextual dependencies. To close the gap, we adapted LMMs for comic strip understanding, obtaining better results on ComicsPAP than 10x bigger models, demonstrating that ComicsPAP offers a robust resource to drive future research in multimodal comic comprehension.

- **Summary**: Recent diffusion model customization has shown impressive results in incorporating subject or style concepts with a handful of images. However, the modular composition of multiple concepts into a customized model, aimed to efficiently merge decentralized-trained concepts without influencing their identities, remains unresolved. Modular customization is essential for applications like concept stylization and multi-concept customization using concepts trained by different users. Existing post-training methods are only confined to a fixed set of concepts, and any different combinations require a new round of retraining. In contrast, instant merging methods often cause identity loss and interference of individual merged concepts and are usually limited to a small number of concepts. To address these issues, we propose BlockLoRA, an instant merging method designed to efficiently combine multiple concepts while accurately preserving individual concepts' identity. With a careful analysis of the underlying reason for interference, we develop the Randomized Output Erasure technique to minimize the interference of different customized models. Additionally, Blockwise LoRA Parameterization is proposed to reduce the identity loss during instant model merging. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BlockLoRA, which can instantly merge 15 concepts of people, subjects, scenes, and styles with high fidelity.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of video understanding are advancing rapidly. To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Multiple studies have performed next-day fire prediction using satellite imagery. Two main satellites are used to detect wildfires: MODIS and VIIRS. Both satellites provide fire mask products, called MOD14 and VNP14, respectively. Studies have used one or the other, but there has been no comparison between them to determine which might be more suitable for next-day fire prediction. In this paper, we first evaluate how well VIIRS and MODIS data can be used to forecast wildfire spread one day ahead. We find that the model using VIIRS as input and VNP14 as target achieves the best results. Interestingly, the model using MODIS as input and VNP14 as target performs significantly better than using VNP14 as input and MOD14 as target. Next, we discuss why MOD14 might be harder to use for predicting next-day fires. We find that the MOD14 fire mask is highly stochastic and does not correlate with reasonable fire spread patterns. This is detrimental for machine learning tasks, as the model learns irrational patterns. Therefore, we conclude that MOD14 is unsuitable for next-day fire prediction and that VNP14 is a much better option. However, using MODIS input and VNP14 as target, we achieve a significant improvement in predictability. This indicates that an improved fire detection model is possible for MODIS.

- **Summary**: Bag-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches have emerged as the mainstream methodology for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. However, most existing methods adopt a segmented training strategy, which first extracts features using a pre-trained feature extractor and then aggregates these features through MIL. This segmented training approach leads to insufficient collaborative optimization between the feature extraction network and the MIL network, preventing end-to-end joint optimization and thereby limiting the overall performance of the model. Additionally, conventional methods typically extract features from all patches of fixed size, ignoring the multi-scale observation characteristics of pathologists. This not only results in significant computational resource waste when tumor regions represent a minimal proportion (as in the Camelyon16 dataset) but may also lead the model to suboptimal solutions.   To address these limitations, this paper proposes an end-to-end multi-scale WSI classification framework that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with multiple instance learning. Specifically, our approach includes: (1) a semantic feature filtering module to reduce interference from non-lesion areas; (2) a multi-scale feature extraction module to capture pathological information at different levels; and (3) a multi-scale fusion MIL module for global modeling and feature integration. Through an end-to-end training strategy, we simultaneously optimize both the feature extractor and MIL network, ensuring maximum compatibility between them.   Experiments were conducted on three cross-center datasets (DigestPath2019, BCNB, and UBC-OCEAN). Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy (ACC) and AUC metrics.

- **Summary**: Despite advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), current approaches struggle in medium-to-long video understanding due to frame and context length limitations. As a result, these models often depend on frame sampling, which risks missing key information over time and lacks task-specific relevance. To address these challenges, we introduce HierarQ, a task-aware hierarchical Q-Former based framework that sequentially processes frames to bypass the need for frame sampling, while avoiding LLM's context length limitations. We introduce a lightweight two-stream language-guided feature modulator to incorporate task awareness in video understanding, with the entity stream capturing frame-level object information within a short context and the scene stream identifying their broader interactions over longer period of time. Each stream is supported by dedicated memory banks which enables our proposed Hierachical Querying transformer (HierarQ) to effectively capture short and long-term context. Extensive evaluations on 10 video benchmarks across video understanding, question answering, and captioning tasks demonstrate HierarQ's state-of-the-art performance across most datasets, proving its robustness and efficiency for comprehensive video analysis.

- **Summary**: The variability and biases in the real-world performance benchmarking of deep learning models for medical imaging compromise their trustworthiness for real-world deployment. The common approach of holding out a single fixed test set fails to quantify the variance in the estimation of test performance metrics. This study introduces NACHOS (Nested and Automated Cross-validation and Hyperparameter Optimization using Supercomputing) to reduce and quantify the variance of test performance metrics of deep learning models. NACHOS integrates Nested Cross-Validation (NCV) and Automated Hyperparameter Optimization (AHPO) within a parallelized high-performance computing (HPC) framework. NACHOS was demonstrated on a chest X-ray repository and an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) dataset under multiple data partitioning schemes. Beyond performance estimation, DACHOS (Deployment with Automated Cross-validation and Hyperparameter Optimization using Supercomputing) is introduced to leverage AHPO and cross-validation to build the final model on the full dataset, improving expected deployment performance. The findings underscore the importance of NCV in quantifying and reducing estimation variance, AHPO in optimizing hyperparameters consistently across test folds, and HPC in ensuring computational feasibility. By integrating these methodologies, NACHOS and DACHOS provide a scalable, reproducible, and trustworthy framework for DL model evaluation and deployment in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: We introduce a pioneering autoregressive generative model for 3D point cloud generation. Inspired by visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), we conceptualize point cloud generation as an autoregressive up-sampling process. This leads to our novel model, PointARU, which progressively refines 3D point clouds from coarse to fine scales. PointARU follows a two-stage training paradigm: first, it learns multi-scale discrete representations of point clouds, and then it trains an autoregressive transformer for next-scale prediction. To address the inherent unordered and irregular structure of point clouds, we incorporate specialized point-based up-sampling network modules in both stages and integrate 3D absolute positional encoding based on the decoded point cloud at each scale during the second stage. Our model surpasses state-of-the-art (SoTA) diffusion-based approaches in both generation quality and parameter efficiency across diverse experimental settings, marking a new milestone for autoregressive methods in 3D point cloud generation. Furthermore, PointARU demonstrates exceptional performance in completing partial 3D shapes and up-sampling sparse point clouds, outperforming existing generative models in these tasks.

- **Summary**: X-ray imaging is indispensable in medical diagnostics, yet its use is tightly regulated due to potential health risks. To mitigate radiation exposure, recent research focuses on generating novel views from sparse inputs and reconstructing Computed Tomography (CT) volumes, borrowing representations from the 3D reconstruction area. However, these representations originally target visible light imaging that emphasizes reflection and scattering effects, while neglecting penetration and attenuation properties of X-ray imaging. In this paper, we introduce X-Field, the first 3D representation specifically designed for X-ray imaging, rooted in the energy absorption rates across different materials. To accurately model diverse materials within internal structures, we employ 3D ellipsoids with distinct attenuation coefficients. To estimate each material's energy absorption of X-rays, we devise an efficient path partitioning algorithm accounting for complex ellipsoid intersections. We further propose hybrid progressive initialization to refine the geometric accuracy of X-Filed and incorporate material-based optimization to enhance model fitting along material boundaries. Experiments show that X-Field achieves superior visual fidelity on both real-world human organ and synthetic object datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in X-ray Novel View Synthesis and CT Reconstruction.

- **Summary**: While surface normals are widely used to analyse 3D scene geometry, surface normal estimation from LiDAR point clouds remains severely underexplored. This is caused by the lack of large-scale annotated datasets on the one hand, and lack of methods that can robustly handle the sparse and often noisy LiDAR data in a reasonable time on the other hand. We address these limitations using a traffic simulation engine and present LiSu, the first large-scale, synthetic LiDAR point cloud dataset with ground truth surface normal annotations, eliminating the need for tedious manual labeling. Additionally, we propose a novel method that exploits the spatiotemporal characteristics of autonomous driving data to enhance surface normal estimation accuracy. By incorporating two regularization terms, we enforce spatial consistency among neighboring points and temporal smoothness across consecutive LiDAR frames. These regularizers are particularly effective in self-training settings, where they mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust real-world deployment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LiSu, achieving state-of-the-art performance in LiDAR surface normal estimation. Moreover, we showcase its full potential in addressing the challenging task of synthetic-to-real domain adaptation, leading to improved neural surface reconstruction on real-world data.

- **Summary**: Cell microscopy data are abundant; however, corresponding segmentation annotations remain scarce. Moreover, variations in cell types, imaging devices, and staining techniques introduce significant domain gaps between datasets. As a result, even large, pretrained segmentation models trained on diverse datasets (source datasets) struggle to generalize to unseen datasets (target datasets). To overcome this generalization problem, we propose CellStyle, which improves the segmentation quality of such models without requiring labels for the target dataset, thereby enabling zero-shot adaptation. CellStyle transfers the attributes of an unannotated target dataset, such as texture, color, and noise, to the annotated source dataset. This transfer is performed while preserving the cell shapes of the source images, ensuring that the existing source annotations can still be used while maintaining the visual characteristics of the target dataset. The styled synthetic images with the existing annotations enable the finetuning of a generalist segmentation model for application to the unannotated target data. We demonstrate that CellStyle significantly improves zero-shot cell segmentation performance across diverse datasets by finetuning multiple segmentation models on the style-transferred data. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: While recent advancements in text-to-video diffusion models enable high-quality short video generation from a single prompt, generating real-world long videos in a single pass remains challenging due to limited data and high computational costs. To address this, several works propose tuning-free approaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation, specifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content changes. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions between adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of semantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose Synchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that synchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range consistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two complementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling, which ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence, respectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns denoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended content changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS synchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise, ensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive experiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video generation, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence, outperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a critical medical emergency caused by the rupture of cerebral blood vessels, leading to internal bleeding within the skull. Accurate and timely classification of hemorrhage subtypes is essential for effective clinical decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose an advanced pyramid vision transformer (PVT)-based model, leveraging its hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture both local and global spatial dependencies in brain CT scans. Instead of processing all extracted features indiscriminately, A SHAP-based feature selection method is employed to identify the most discriminative components, which are then used as a latent feature space to train a boosting neural network, reducing computational complexity. We introduce an entropy-aware aggregation strategy along with a fuzzy integral operator to fuse information across multiple CT slices, ensuring a more comprehensive and reliable scan-level diagnosis by accounting for inter-slice dependencies. Experimental results show that our PVT-based framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in terms of classification accuracy, precision, and robustness. By combining SHAP-driven feature selection, transformer-based modeling, and an entropy-aware fuzzy integral operator for decision fusion, our method offers a scalable and computationally efficient AI-driven solution for automated ICH subtype classification.

- **Summary**: Although end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) technologies have made significant progress in recent years, there remains an unsatisfactory performance on closed-loop evaluation. The potential of leveraging planning in query design and interaction has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we introduce a multi-granularity planning query representation that integrates heterogeneous waypoints, including spatial, temporal, and driving-style waypoints across various sampling patterns. It provides additional supervision for trajectory prediction, enhancing precise closed-loop control for the ego vehicle. Additionally, we explicitly utilize the geometric properties of planning trajectories to effectively retrieve relevant image features based on physical locations using deformable attention. By combining these strategies, we propose a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework, termed HiP-AD, which simultaneously performs perception, prediction, and planning within a unified decoder. HiP-AD enables comprehensive interaction by allowing planning queries to iteratively interact with perception queries in the BEV space while dynamically extracting image features from perspective views. Experiments demonstrate that HiP-AD outperforms all existing end-to-end autonomous driving methods on the closed-loop benchmark Bench2Drive and achieves competitive performance on the real-world dataset nuScenes.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image generation have primarily relied on extensive datasets and parameter-heavy architectures. These requirements severely limit accessibility for researchers and practitioners who lack substantial computational resources. In this paper, we introduce \model, an efficient training paradigm for image generation models that uses knowledge distillation (KD) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Drawing inspiration from the success of data KD techniques widely adopted in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), LightGen distills knowledge from state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image models into a compact Masked Autoregressive (MAR) architecture with only $0.7B$ parameters. Using a compact synthetic dataset of just $2M$ high-quality images generated from varied captions, we demonstrate that data diversity significantly outweighs data volume in determining model performance. This strategy dramatically reduces computational demands and reduces pre-training time from potentially thousands of GPU-days to merely 88 GPU-days. Furthermore, to address the inherent shortcomings of synthetic data, particularly poor high-frequency details and spatial inaccuracies, we integrate the DPO technique that refines image fidelity and positional accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that LightGen achieves image generation quality comparable to SOTA models while significantly reducing computational resources and expanding accessibility for resource-constrained environments.

- **Summary**: While MLLMs have demonstrated adequate image understanding capabilities, they still struggle with pixel-level comprehension, limiting their practical applications. Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding.   Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering.   HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations of policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance model robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future advancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making for MLLMs.

- **Summary**: A common belief is that intrinsically interpretable deep learning models ensure a correct, intuitive understanding of their behavior and offer greater robustness against accidental errors or intentional manipulation. However, these beliefs have not been comprehensively verified, and growing evidence casts doubt on them. In this paper, we highlight the risks related to overreliance and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation of these so-called "intrinsically (aka inherently) interpretable" models by design. We introduce two strategies for adversarial analysis with prototype manipulation and backdoor attacks against prototype-based networks, and discuss how concept bottleneck models defend against these attacks. Fooling the model's reasoning by exploiting its use of latent prototypes manifests the inherent uninterpretability of deep neural networks, leading to a false sense of security reinforced by a visual confirmation bias. The reported limitations of prototype-based networks put their trustworthiness and applicability into question, motivating further work on the robustness and alignment of (deep) interpretable models.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-based 3D detectors need large datasets for training, yet they struggle to generalize to novel domains. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to mitigate this by training detectors that are invariant to such domain shifts. Current DG approaches exclusively rely on global geometric features (point cloud Cartesian coordinates) as input features. Over-reliance on these global geometric features can, however, cause 3D detectors to prioritize object location and absolute position, resulting in poor cross-domain performance. To mitigate this, we propose to exploit explicit local point cloud structure for DG, in particular by encoding point cloud neighborhoods with Gaussian blobs, GBlobs. Our proposed formulation is highly efficient and requires no additional parameters. Without any bells and whistles, simply by integrating GBlobs in existing detectors, we beat the current state-of-the-art in challenging single-source DG benchmarks by over 21 mAP (Waymo->KITTI), 13 mAP (KITTI->Waymo), and 12 mAP (nuScenes->KITTI), without sacrificing in-domain performance. Additionally, GBlobs demonstrate exceptional performance in multi-source DG, surpassing the current state-of-the-art by 17, 12, and 5 mAP on Waymo, KITTI, and ONCE, respectively.

- **Summary**: Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation, achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical concepts such as Markov chains and SDEs. 3) Guided by this simple framework, more efficient inference methods can be discovered.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Virtual Try-On (VITON) have significantly improved image realism and garment detail preservation, driven by powerful text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on user-provided masks, introducing complexity and performance degradation due to imperfect inputs, as shown in Fig.1(a). To address this, we propose a Mask-Free VITON (MF-VITON) framework that achieves realistic VITON using only a single person image and a target garment, eliminating the requirement for auxiliary masks. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage pipeline: (1) We leverage existing Mask-based VITON models to synthesize a high-quality dataset. This dataset contains diverse, realistic pairs of person images and corresponding garments, augmented with varied backgrounds to mimic real-world scenarios. (2) The pre-trained Mask-based model is fine-tuned on the generated dataset, enabling garment transfer without mask dependencies. This stage simplifies the input requirements while preserving garment texture and shape fidelity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance regarding garment transfer accuracy and visual realism. Notably, the proposed Mask-Free model significantly outperforms existing Mask-based approaches, setting a new benchmark and demonstrating a substantial lead over previous approaches.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a task-oriented co-design framework that integrates communication, computing, and control to address the key challenges of bandwidth limitations, noise interference, and latency in mission-critical industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). To improve communication efficiency and robustness, we design a task-oriented Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) using Information Bottleneck (IB) to enhance data transmission efficiency by prioritizing task-specific information. To mitigate the perceived End-to-End (E2E) delays, we develop a Delay-Aware Trajectory-Guided Control Prediction (DTCP) strategy that integrates trajectory planning with control prediction, predicting commands based on E2E delay. Moreover, the DTCP is co-designed with task-oriented JSCC, focusing on transmitting task-specific information for timely and reliable autonomous driving. Experimental results in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that, under an E2E delay of 1 second (20 time slots), the proposed framework achieves a driving score of 48.12, which is 31.59 points higher than using Better Portable Graphics (BPG) while reducing bandwidth usage by 99.19%.

- **Summary**: Until recently, robotics safety research was predominantly about collision avoidance and hazard reduction in the immediate vicinity of a robot. Since the advent of large vision and language models (VLMs), robots are now also capable of higher-level semantic scene understanding and natural language interactions with humans. Despite their known vulnerabilities (e.g. hallucinations or jail-breaking), VLMs are being handed control of robots capable of physical contact with the real world. This can lead to dangerous behaviors, making semantic safety for robots a matter of immediate concern. Our contributions in this paper are two fold: first, to address these emerging risks, we release the ASIMOV Benchmark, a large-scale and comprehensive collection of datasets for evaluating and improving semantic safety of foundation models serving as robot brains. Our data generation recipe is highly scalable: by leveraging text and image generation techniques, we generate undesirable situations from real-world visual scenes and human injury reports from hospitals. Secondly, we develop a framework to automatically generate robot constitutions from real-world data to steer a robot's behavior using Constitutional AI mechanisms. We propose a novel auto-amending process that is able to introduce nuances in written rules of behavior; this can lead to increased alignment with human preferences on behavior desirability and safety. We explore trade-offs between generality and specificity across a diverse set of constitutions of different lengths, and demonstrate that a robot is able to effectively reject unconstitutional actions. We measure a top alignment rate of 84.3% on the ASIMOV Benchmark using generated constitutions, outperforming no-constitution baselines and human-written constitutions.

- **Summary**: Multiview diffusion models have shown considerable success in image-to-3D generation for general objects. However, when applied to human data, existing methods have yet to deliver promising results, largely due to the challenges of scaling multiview attention to higher resolutions. In this paper, we explore human multiview diffusion models at the megapixel level and introduce a solution called mesh attention to enable training at 1024x1024 resolution. Using a clothed human mesh as a central coarse geometric representation, the proposed mesh attention leverages rasterization and projection to establish direct cross-view coordinate correspondences. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of multiview attention while maintaining cross-view consistency. Building on this foundation, we devise a mesh attention block and combine it with keypoint conditioning to create our human-specific multiview diffusion model, MEAT. In addition, we present valuable insights into applying multiview human motion videos for diffusion training, addressing the longstanding issue of data scarcity. Extensive experiments show that MEAT effectively generates dense, consistent multiview human images at the megapixel level, outperforming existing multiview diffusion methods.

- **Summary**: We present a novel perspective on learning video embedders for generative modeling: rather than requiring an exact reproduction of an input video, an effective embedder should focus on synthesizing visually plausible reconstructions. This relaxed criterion enables substantial improvements in compression ratios without compromising the quality of downstream generative models. Specifically, we propose replacing the conventional encoder-decoder video embedder with an encoder-generator framework that employs a diffusion transformer (DiT) to synthesize missing details from a compact latent space. Therein, we develop a dedicated latent conditioning module to condition the DiT decoder on the encoded video latent embedding. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach enables superior encoding-decoding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the compression ratio increases. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we report results from our video embedders achieving a temporal compression ratio of up to 32x (8x higher than leading video embedders) and validate the robustness of this ultra-compact latent space for text-to-video generation, providing a significant efficiency boost in latent diffusion model training and inference.

- **Summary**: Vector Quantization (VQ) has emerged as a prominent weight compression technique, showcasing substantially lower quantization errors than uniform quantization across diverse models, particularly in extreme compression scenarios. However, its efficacy during fine-tuning is limited by the constraint of the compression format, where weight vectors assigned to the same codeword are restricted to updates in the same direction. Consequently, many quantized weights are compelled to move in directions contrary to their local gradient information. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a novel VQ paradigm, Sign-Splitting VQ (SSVQ), which decouples the sign bit of weights from the codebook. Our approach involves extracting the sign bits of uncompressed weights and performing clustering and compression on all-positive weights. We then introduce latent variables for the sign bit and jointly optimize both the signs and the codebook. Additionally, we implement a progressive freezing strategy for the learnable sign to ensure training stability. Extensive experiments on various modern models and tasks demonstrate that SSVQ achieves a significantly superior compression-accuracy trade-off compared to conventional VQ. Furthermore, we validate our algorithm on a hardware accelerator, showing that SSVQ achieves a 3$\times$ speedup over the 8-bit compressed model by reducing memory access.

- **Summary**: Keypoint detection and local feature description are fundamental tasks in robotic perception, critical for applications such as SLAM, robot localization, feature matching, pose estimation, and 3D mapping. While existing methods predominantly operate on RGB images, we propose a novel network that directly processes raw images, bypassing the need for the Image Signal Processor (ISP). This approach significantly reduces hardware requirements and memory consumption, which is crucial for robotic vision systems. Our method introduces two custom-designed convolutional kernels capable of performing convolutions directly on raw images, preserving inter-channel information without converting to RGB. Experimental results show that our network outperforms existing algorithms on raw images, achieving higher accuracy and stability under large rotations and scale variations. This work represents the first attempt to develop a keypoint detection and feature description network specifically for raw images, offering a more efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.

- **Summary**: Depth-guided multimodal fusion combines depth information from visible and infrared images, significantly enhancing the performance of 3D reconstruction and robotics applications. Existing thermal-visible image fusion mainly focuses on detection tasks, ignoring other critical information such as depth. By addressing the limitations of single modalities in low-light and complex environments, the depth information from fused images not only generates more accurate point cloud data, improving the completeness and precision of 3D reconstruction, but also provides comprehensive scene understanding for robot navigation, localization, and environmental perception. This supports precise recognition and efficient operations in applications such as autonomous driving and rescue missions. We introduce a text-guided and depth-driven infrared and visible image fusion network. The model consists of an image fusion branch for extracting multi-channel complementary information through a diffusion model, equipped with a text-guided module, and two auxiliary depth estimation branches. The fusion branch uses CLIP to extract semantic information and parameters from depth-enriched image descriptions to guide the diffusion model in extracting multi-channel features and generating fused images. These fused images are then input into the depth estimation branches to calculate depth-driven loss, optimizing the image fusion network. This framework aims to integrate vision-language and depth to directly generate color-fused images from multimodal inputs.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized object-oriented image editing, yet their deployment in realistic object removal and insertion remains hampered by challenges such as the intricate interplay of physical effects and insufficient paired training data. In this work, we introduce OmniPaint, a unified framework that re-conceptualizes object removal and insertion as interdependent processes rather than isolated tasks. Leveraging a pre-trained diffusion prior along with a progressive training pipeline comprising initial paired sample optimization and subsequent large-scale unpaired refinement via CycleFlow, OmniPaint achieves precise foreground elimination and seamless object insertion while faithfully preserving scene geometry and intrinsic properties. Furthermore, our novel CFD metric offers a robust, reference-free evaluation of context consistency and object hallucination, establishing a new benchmark for high-fidelity image editing.

- **Summary**: We introduce GarmentCrafter, a new approach that enables non-professional users to create and modify 3D garments from a single-view image. While recent advances in image generation have facilitated 2D garment design, creating and editing 3D garments remains challenging for non-professional users. Existing methods for single-view 3D reconstruction often rely on pre-trained generative models to synthesize novel views conditioning on the reference image and camera pose, yet they lack cross-view consistency, failing to capture the internal relationships across different views. In this paper, we tackle this challenge through progressive depth prediction and image warping to approximate novel views. Subsequently, we train a multi-view diffusion model to complete occluded and unknown clothing regions, informed by the evolving camera pose. By jointly inferring RGB and depth, GarmentCrafter enforces inter-view coherence and reconstructs precise geometries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual fidelity and inter-view coherence compared to state-of-the-art single-view 3D garment reconstruction methods.

- **Summary**: Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving holds great promise for improving safety by addressing the perception and prediction uncertainties inherent in single-agent systems. However, traditional cooperative methods are constrained by rigid collaboration protocols and limited generalization to unseen interactive scenarios. While LLM-based approaches offer generalized reasoning capabilities, their challenges in spatial planning and unstable inference latency hinder their direct application in cooperative driving. To address these limitations, we propose CoLMDriver, the first full-pipeline LLM-based cooperative driving system, enabling effective language-based negotiation and real-time driving control. CoLMDriver features a parallel driving pipeline with two key components: (i) an LLM-based negotiation module under an actor-critic paradigm, which continuously refines cooperation policies through feedback from previous decisions of all vehicles; and (ii) an intention-guided waypoint generator, which translates negotiation outcomes into executable waypoints. Additionally, we introduce InterDrive, a CARLA-based simulation benchmark comprising 10 challenging interactive driving scenarios for evaluating V2V cooperation. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLMDriver significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 11% higher success rate across diverse highly interactive V2V driving scenarios. Code will be released on https://github.com/cxliu0314/CoLMDriver.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel visual tokenization framework that embeds a provable PCA-like structure into the latent token space. While existing visual tokenizers primarily optimize for reconstruction fidelity, they often neglect the structural properties of the latent space -- a critical factor for both interpretability and downstream tasks. Our method generates a 1D causal token sequence for images, where each successive token contributes non-overlapping information with mathematically guaranteed decreasing explained variance, analogous to principal component analysis. This structural constraint ensures the tokenizer extracts the most salient visual features first, with each subsequent token adding diminishing yet complementary information. Additionally, we identified and resolved a semantic-spectrum coupling effect that causes the unwanted entanglement of high-level semantic content and low-level spectral details in the tokens by leveraging a diffusion decoder. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and enables better interpretability to align with the human vision system. Moreover, auto-regressive models trained on our token sequences achieve performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer tokens for training and inference.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in unified multimodal understanding and visual generation (or multimodal generation) models have been hindered by their quadratic computational complexity and dependence on large-scale training data. We present OmniMamba, the first linear-architecture-based multimodal generation model that generates both text and images through a unified next-token prediction paradigm. The model fully leverages Mamba-2's high computational and memory efficiency, extending its capabilities from text generation to multimodal generation. To address the data inefficiency of existing unified models, we propose two key innovations: (1) decoupled vocabularies to guide modality-specific generation, and (2) task-specific LoRA for parameter-efficient adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce a decoupled two-stage training strategy to mitigate data imbalance between two tasks. Equipped with these techniques, OmniMamba achieves competitive performance with JanusFlow while surpassing Show-o across benchmarks, despite being trained on merely 2M image-text pairs, which is 1,000 times fewer than Show-o. Notably, OmniMamba stands out with outstanding inference efficiency, achieving up to a 119.2 times speedup and 63% GPU memory reduction for long-sequence generation compared to Transformer-based counterparts.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in long video understanding typically mitigate visual redundancy through visual token pruning based on attention distribution. However, while existing methods employ post-hoc low-response token pruning in decoder layers, they overlook the input-level semantic correlation between visual tokens and instructions (query). In this paper, we propose QuoTA, an ante-hoc training-free modular that extends existing large video-language models (LVLMs) for visual token assignment based on query-oriented frame-level importance assessment. The query-oriented token selection is crucial as it aligns visual processing with task-specific requirements, optimizing token budget utilization while preserving semantically relevant content. Specifically, (i) QuoTA strategically allocates frame-level importance scores based on query relevance, enabling one-time visual token assignment before cross-modal interactions in decoder layers, (ii) we decouple the query through Chain-of-Thoughts reasoning to facilitate more precise LVLM-based frame importance scoring, and (iii) QuoTA offers a plug-and-play functionality that extends to existing LVLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that implementing QuoTA with LLaVA-Video-7B yields an average performance improvement of 3.2% across six benchmarks (including Video-MME and MLVU) while operating within an identical visual token budget as the baseline.
