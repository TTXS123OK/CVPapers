- **Summary**: The scanning time for a fully sampled MRI can be undesirably lengthy. Compressed sensing has been developed to minimize image artifacts in accelerated scans, but the required iterative reconstruction is computationally complex and difficult to generalize on new cases. Image-domain-based deep learning methods (e.g., convolutional neural networks) emerged as a faster alternative but face challenges in modeling continuous k-space, a problem amplified with non-Cartesian sampling commonly used in accelerated acquisition. In comparison, implicit neural representations can model continuous signals in the frequency domain and thus are compatible with arbitrary k-space sampling patterns. The current study develops a novel generative-adversarially trained implicit neural representations (k-GINR) for de novo undersampled non-Cartesian k-space reconstruction. k-GINR consists of two stages: 1) supervised training on an existing patient cohort; 2) self-supervised patient-specific optimization. In stage 1, the network is trained with the generative-adversarial network on diverse patients of the same anatomical region supervised by fully sampled acquisition. In stage 2, undersampled k-space data of individual patients is used to tailor the prior-embedded network for patient-specific optimization. The UCSF StarVIBE T1-weighted liver dataset was evaluated on the proposed framework. k-GINR is compared with an image-domain deep learning method, Deep Cascade CNN, and a compressed sensing method. k-GINR consistently outperformed the baselines with a larger performance advantage observed at very high accelerations (e.g., 20 times). k-GINR offers great value for direct non-Cartesian k-space reconstruction for new incoming patients across a wide range of accelerations liver anatomy.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial for clinical diagnostics but is hindered by prolonged scan times. Current deep learning models enhance MRI reconstruction but are often memory-intensive and unsuitable for resource-limited systems. This paper introduces a lightweight MRI reconstruction model leveraging Kronecker-Parameterized Hypercomplex Neural Networks to achieve high performance with reduced parameters. By integrating Kronecker-based modules, including Kronecker MLP, Kronecker Window Attention, and Kronecker Convolution, the proposed model efficiently extracts spatial features while preserving representational power. We introduce Kronecker U-Net and Kronecker SwinMR, which maintain high reconstruction quality with approximately 50% fewer parameters compared to existing models. Experimental evaluation on the FastMRI dataset demonstrates competitive PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, even at high acceleration factors (8x and 16x), with no significant performance drop. Additionally, Kronecker variants exhibit superior generalization and reduced overfitting on limited datasets, facilitating efficient MRI reconstruction on hardware-constrained systems. This approach sets a new benchmark for parameter-efficient medical imaging models.

- **Summary**: Despite recent successes in novel view synthesis using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), modeling scenes with sparse inputs remains a challenge. In this work, we address two critical yet overlooked issues in real-world sparse-input modeling: extrapolation and occlusion. To tackle these issues, we propose to use a reconstruction by generation pipeline that leverages learned priors from video diffusion models to provide plausible interpretations for regions outside the field of view or occluded. However, the generated sequences exhibit inconsistencies that do not fully benefit subsequent 3DGS modeling. To address the challenge of inconsistencies, we introduce a novel scene-grounding guidance based on rendered sequences from an optimized 3DGS, which tames the diffusion model to generate consistent sequences. This guidance is training-free and does not require any fine-tuning of the diffusion model. To facilitate holistic scene modeling, we also propose a trajectory initialization method. It effectively identifies regions that are outside the field of view and occluded. We further design a scheme tailored for 3DGS optimization with generated sequences. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves upon the baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Monocular Indoor Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to reconstruct a 3D semantic occupancy map from a single RGB image of an indoor scene, inferring spatial layout and object categories from 2D image cues. The challenge of this task arises from the depth, scale, and shape ambiguities that emerge when transforming a 2D image into 3D space, particularly within the complex and often heavily occluded environments of indoor scenes. Current SSC methods often struggle with these ambiguities, resulting in distorted or missing object representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative approach that leverages novel view synthesis and multiview fusion. Specifically, we demonstrate how virtual cameras can be placed around the scene to emulate multiview inputs that enhance contextual scene information. We also introduce a Multiview Fusion Adaptor (MVFA) to effectively combine the multiview 3D scene predictions into a unified 3D semantic occupancy map. Finally, we identify and study the inherent limitation of generative techniques when applied to SSC, specifically the Novelty-Consistency tradeoff. Our system, GenFuSE, demonstrates IoU score improvements of up to 2.8% for Scene Completion and 4.9% for Semantic Scene Completion when integrated with existing SSC networks on the NYUv2 dataset. This work introduces GenFuSE as a standard framework for advancing monocular SSC with synthesized inputs.

- **Summary**: Current research on bias in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has important limitations: it is focused exclusively on trait associations while ignoring other forms of stereotyping, it examines specific contexts where biases are expected to appear, and it conceptualizes social categories like race and gender as binary, ignoring the multifaceted nature of these identities. Using standardized facial images that vary in prototypicality, we test four VLMs for both trait associations and homogeneity bias in open-ended contexts. We find that VLMs consistently generate more uniform stories for women compared to men, with people who are more gender prototypical in appearance being represented more uniformly. By contrast, VLMs represent White Americans more uniformly than Black Americans. Unlike with gender prototypicality, race prototypicality was not related to stronger uniformity. In terms of trait associations, we find limited evidence of stereotyping-Black Americans were consistently linked with basketball across all models, while other racial associations (i.e., art, healthcare, appearance) varied by specific VLM. These findings demonstrate that VLM stereotyping manifests in ways that go beyond simple group membership, suggesting that conventional bias mitigation strategies may be insufficient to address VLM stereotyping and that homogeneity bias persists even when trait associations are less apparent in model outputs.



### We Care Each Pixel: Calibrating on Medical Segmentation Model

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is fundamental for computer-aided diagnostics, providing accurate delineation of anatomical structures and pathological regions. While common metrics such as Accuracy, DSC, IoU, and HD primarily quantify spatial agreement between predictions and ground-truth labels, they do not assess the calibration quality of segmentation models, which is crucial for clinical reliability. To address this limitation, we propose pixel-wise Expected Calibration Error (pECE), a novel metric that explicitly measures miscalibration at the pixel level, thereby ensuring both spatial precision and confidence reliability. We further introduce a morphological adaptation strategy that applies morphological operations to ground-truth masks before computing calibration losses, particularly benefiting margin-based losses such as Margin SVLS and NACL. Additionally, we present the Signed Distance Calibration Loss (SDC), which aligns boundary geometry with calibration objectives by penalizing discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth signed distance functions (SDFs). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only enhances segmentation performance but also improves calibration quality, yielding more trustworthy confidence estimates.

- **Summary**: Existing image steganography methods face fundamental limitations in hiding capacity (typically $1\sim7$ images) due to severe information interference and uncoordinated capacity-distortion trade-off. We propose SMILENet, a novel synergistic framework that achieves 25 image hiding through three key innovations: (i) A synergistic network architecture coordinates reversible and non-reversible operations to efficiently exploit information redundancy in both secret and cover images. The reversible Invertible Cover-Driven Mosaic (ICDM) module and Invertible Mosaic Secret Embedding (IMSE) module establish cover-guided mosaic transformations and representation embedding with mathematically guaranteed invertibility for distortion-free embedding. The non-reversible Secret Information Selection (SIS) module and Secret Detail Enhancement (SDE) module implement learnable feature modulation for critical information selection and enhancement. (ii) A unified training strategy that coordinates complementary modules to achieve 3.0x higher capacity than existing methods with superior visual quality. (iii) Last but not least, we introduce a new metric to model Capacity-Distortion Trade-off for evaluating the image steganography algorithms that jointly considers hiding capacity and distortion, and provides a unified evaluation approach for accessing results with different number of secret image. Extensive experiments on DIV2K, Paris StreetView and ImageNet1K show that SMILENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of hiding capacity, recovery quality as well as security against steganalysis methods.

- **Summary**: Recent feature matching methods have achieved remarkable performance but lack efficiency consideration. In this paper, we revisit the mainstream detector-free matching pipeline and improve all its stages considering both accuracy and efficiency. We propose an Efficient Deep feature Matching network, EDM. We first adopt a deeper CNN with fewer dimensions to extract multi-level features. Then we present a Correlation Injection Module that conducts feature transformation on high-level deep features, and progressively injects feature correlations from global to local for efficient multi-scale feature aggregation, improving both speed and performance. In the refinement stage, a novel lightweight bidirectional axis-based regression head is designed to directly predict subpixel-level correspondences from latent features, avoiding the significant computational cost of explicitly locating keypoints on high-resolution local feature heatmaps. Moreover, effective selection strategies are introduced to enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our EDM achieves competitive matching accuracy on various benchmarks and exhibits excellent efficiency, offering valuable best practices for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce the HexPlane representation for 3D semantic scene understanding. Specifically, we first design the View Projection Module (VPM) to project the 3D point cloud into six planes to maximally retain the original spatial information. Features of six planes are extracted by the 2D encoder and sent to the HexPlane Association Module (HAM) to adaptively fuse the most informative information for each point. The fused point features are further fed to the task head to yield the ultimate predictions. Compared to the popular point and voxel representation, the HexPlane representation is efficient and can utilize highly optimized 2D operations to process sparse and unordered 3D point clouds. It can also leverage off-the-shelf 2D models, network weights, and training recipes to achieve accurate scene understanding in 3D space. On ScanNet and SemanticKITTI benchmarks, our algorithm, dubbed HexNet3D, achieves competitive performance with previous algorithms. In particular, on the ScanNet 3D segmentation task, our method obtains 77.0 mIoU on the validation set, surpassing Point Transformer V2 by 1.6 mIoU. We also observe encouraging results in indoor 3D detection tasks. Note that our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing voxel-based, point-based, and range-based approaches and brings considerable gains without bells and whistles. The codes will be available upon publication.

- **Summary**: Recently DeepSeek R1 demonstrated how reinforcement learning with simple rule-based incentives can enable autonomous development of complex reasoning in large language models, characterized by the "aha moment", in which the model manifest self-reflection and increased response length during training. However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

- **Summary**: Sea surface temperature (SST) is a fundamental physical parameter characterising the thermal state of sea surface. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8, with its 100-meter spatial resolution, offers a unique opportunity to uncover fine-scale coastal SST patterns that would otherwise be overlooked by coarser-resolution thermal sensors. In this study, we first develop an operational approach for SST retrieval from the TIRS sensor, and subsequently propose a novel algorithm for establishing daily SST climatology which serves as the baseline to detect anomalous SST events. We applied the proposed methods to temperate coastal waters in South Australia for the ten-year period from 2014 to 2023. For ground validation purposes, a buoy was deployed off the coast of Port Lincoln, South Australia, to record in-situ time-series SST. The spatiotemporal patterns of SST in the study area were analysed based on the ten years of satellite-derived SST imagery. The daily baseline climatology of SST with 100 m resolution was constructed, which allowed for the detection and analysis of anomalous SST events during the study period of 2014-2023. Our results suggest the following: (1) the satellite-derived SST data, generated with the proposed algorithm, aligned well with the in-situ measured SST values; (2) the semi-enclosed, shallow regions of Upper Spencer Gulf and Upper St Vincent Gulf showed higher temperatures during summer and cooler temperatures during winter than waters closer to the open ocean, resulting in a higher seasonal variation in SST; (3) the near-shore shallow areas in Spencer Gulf and St Vincent Gulf, and regions surrounding Kangaroo Island, were identified to have a higher probability of SST anomalies compared to the rest of the study area; and (4) anomalous SST events were more likely to happen during the warm months than the cool months.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Feature caching has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate diffusion transformer (DiT) sampling through temporal feature reuse. It is a challenging problem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks significantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\% of blocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic perturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error correction. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache (GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient queue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and recomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent steps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by caching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of feature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the denoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these detected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error correction. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior trade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\% cached blocks, GOC achieves IS 216.28 (26.3\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\% lower) compared to baseline DiT, while maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist across various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different acceleration requirements.

- **Summary**: The automatic reconstruction of 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models from CAD sketches has recently gained significant attention in the computer vision community. Most existing methods, however, rely on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth for supervision, which are often difficult to be obtained in industrial applications and are sensitive to noise inputs. We propose viewing CAD reconstruction as a specific instance of sparse-view 3D reconstruction to overcome these limitations. While this reformulation offers a promising perspective, existing 3D reconstruction methods typically require natural images and corresponding camera poses as inputs, which introduces two major significant challenges: (1) modality discrepancy between CAD sketches and natural images, and (2) difficulty of accurate camera pose estimation for CAD sketches. To solve these issues, we first transform the CAD sketches into representations resembling natural images and extract corresponding masks. Next, we manually calculate the camera poses for the orthographic views to ensure accurate alignment within the 3D coordinate system. Finally, we employ a customized sparse-view 3D reconstruction method to achieve high-quality reconstructions from aligned orthographic views. By leveraging raster CAD sketches for self-supervision, our approach eliminates the reliance on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth. Experiments on the Sub-Fusion360 dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms previous approaches in CAD reconstruction performance and exhibits strong robustness to noisy inputs.

- **Summary**: We have recently seen great progress in 3D scene reconstruction through explicit point-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), notable for its high quality and fast rendering speed. However, reconstructing dynamic scenes such as complex human performances with long durations remains challenging. Prior efforts fall short of modeling a long-term sequence with drastic motions, frequent topology changes or interactions with props, and resort to segmenting the whole sequence into groups of frames that are processed independently, which undermines temporal stability and thereby leads to an unpleasant viewing experience and inefficient storage footprint. In view of this, we introduce EvolvingGS, a two-stage strategy that first deforms the Gaussian model to coarsely align with the target frame, and then refines it with minimal point addition/subtraction, particularly in fast-changing areas. Owing to the flexibility of the incrementally evolving representation, our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both per-frame and temporal quality metrics while maintaining fast rendering through its purely explicit representation. Moreover, by exploiting temporal coherence between successive frames, we propose a simple yet effective compression algorithm that achieves over 50x compression rate. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and challenging custom datasets demonstrate that our method significantly advances the state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction, particularly for extended sequences with complex human performances.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has demonstrated great promise in cancer classification from whole-slide images (WSIs) but remains constrained by the need for extensive annotations. Annotation-free methods, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged to address this challenge; however, current SSL techniques often depend on synthetic augmentations or temporal context, which may not adequately capture the intricate spatial relationships inherent to histopathology. In this work, we introduce a novel spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy for SSL that leverages the natural coherence of adjacent patches in WSIs. By constructing biologically relevant positive pairs from spatially proximate patches, our approach harnesses inherent spatial coherence to enhance patch-level representations, ultimately boosting slide-level classification performance. Experiments on multiple datasets reveal that our strategy improves classification accuracy by 5\% to 10\% over the standard method, paving the way for more clinically relevant AI models in cancer diagnosis.

Existing single RGB-based methods often compromise accuracy due to their reliance on initial pose estimates and susceptibility to rotational ambiguity, while approaches requiring depth sensors or multi-view setups incur significant deployment costs. To address these limitations, we introduce SplatPose, a novel framework that synergizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a dual-branch neural architecture to achieve high-precision pose estimation using only a single RGB image. Central to our approach is the Dual-Attention Ray Scoring Network (DARS-Net), which innovatively decouples positional and angular alignment through geometry-domain attention mechanisms, explicitly modeling directional dependencies to mitigate rotational ambiguity. Additionally, a coarse-to-fine optimization pipeline progressively refines pose estimates by aligning dense 2D features between query images and 3DGS-synthesized views, effectively correcting feature misalignment and depth errors from sparse ray sampling. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SplatPose achieves state-of-the-art 6-DoF pose estimation accuracy in single RGB settings, rivaling approaches that depend on depth or multi-view images.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis (NVS) and surface reconstruction (SR) are essential tasks in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Despite recent progress, these tasks are often addressed independently, with GS-based rendering methods struggling under diverse light conditions and failing to produce accurate surfaces, while GS-based reconstruction methods frequently compromise rendering quality. This raises a central question: must rendering and reconstruction always involve a trade-off? To address this, we propose MGSR, a 2D/3D Mutual-boosted Gaussian splatting for Surface Reconstruction that enhances both rendering quality and 3D reconstruction accuracy. MGSR introduces two branches--one based on 2D-GS and the other on 3D-GS. The 2D-GS branch excels in surface reconstruction, providing precise geometry information to the 3D-GS branch. Leveraging this geometry, the 3D-GS branch employs a geometry-guided illumination decomposition module that captures reflected and transmitted components, enabling realistic rendering under varied light conditions. Using the transmitted component as supervision, the 2D-GS branch also achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction. Throughout the optimization process, the 2D-GS and 3D-GS branches undergo alternating optimization, providing mutual supervision. Prior to this, each branch completes an independent warm-up phase, with an early stopping strategy implemented to reduce computational costs. We evaluate MGSR on a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, at both object and scene levels, demonstrating strong performance in rendering and surface reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Low rank tensor representation (LRTR) methods are very useful for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD). To overcome the limitations that they often overlook spectral anomaly and rely on large-scale matrix singular value decomposition, we first apply non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to alleviate spectral dimensionality redundancy and extract spectral anomaly and then employ LRTR to extract spatial anomaly while mitigating spatial redundancy, yielding a highly efffcient layered tensor decomposition (LTD) framework for HAD. An iterative algorithm based on proximal alternating minimization is developed to solve the proposed LTD model, with convergence guarantees provided. Moreover, we introduce a rank reduction strategy with validation mechanism that adaptively reduces data size while preventing excessive reduction. Theoretically, we rigorously establish the equivalence between the tensor tubal rank and tensor group sparsity regularization (TGSR) and, under mild conditions, demonstrate that the relaxed formulation of TGSR shares the same global minimizers and optimal values as its original counterpart. Experimental results on the Airport-Beach-Urban and MVTec datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the HAD task.

- **Summary**: In recent text-video retrieval, the use of additional captions from vision-language models has shown promising effects on the performance. However, existing models using additional captions often have struggled to capture the rich semantics, including temporal changes, inherent in the video. In addition, incorrect information caused by generative models can lead to inaccurate retrieval. To address these issues, we propose a new framework, Narrating the Video (NarVid), which strategically leverages the comprehensive information available from frame-level captions, the narration. The proposed NarVid exploits narration in multiple ways: 1) feature enhancement through cross-modal interactions between narration and video, 2) query-aware adaptive filtering to suppress irrelevant or incorrect information, 3) dual-modal matching score by adding query-video similarity and query-narration similarity, and 4) hard-negative loss to learn discriminative features from multiple perspectives using the two similarities from different views. Experimental results demonstrate that NarVid achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Unpaired Multi-Modal Learning (UMML) which leverages unpaired multi-modal data to boost model performance on each individual modality has attracted a lot of research interests in medical image analysis. However, existing UMML methods require multi-modal datasets to be fully labeled, which incurs tremendous annotation cost. In this paper, we investigate the use of partially labeled data for label-efficient unpaired multi-modal learning, which can reduce the annotation cost by up to one half. We term the new learning paradigm as Partially Supervised Unpaired Multi-Modal Learning (PSUMML) and propose a novel Decomposed partial class adaptation with snapshot Ensembled Self-Training (DEST) framework for it. Specifically, our framework consists of a compact segmentation network with modality specific normalization layers for learning with partially labeled unpaired multi-modal data. The key challenge in PSUMML lies in the complex partial class distribution discrepancy due to partial class annotation, which hinders effective knowledge transfer across modalities. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon with a decomposition theorem and propose a decomposed partial class adaptation technique to precisely align the partially labeled classes across modalities to reduce the distribution discrepancy. We further propose a snapshot ensembled self-training technique to leverage the valuable snapshot models during training to assign pseudo-labels to partially labeled pixels for self-training to boost model performance. We perform extensive experiments under different scenarios of PSUMML for two medical image segmentation tasks, namely cardiac substructure segmentation and abdominal multi-organ segmentation. Our framework outperforms existing methods significantly.

- **Summary**: We propose selective-training Gaussian head avatars (STGA) to enhance the details of dynamic head Gaussian. The dynamic head Gaussian model is trained based on the FLAME parameterized model. Each Gaussian splat is embedded within the FLAME mesh to achieve mesh-based animation of the Gaussian model. Before training, our selection strategy calculates the 3D Gaussian splat to be optimized in each frame. The parameters of these 3D Gaussian splats are optimized in the training of each frame, while those of the other splats are frozen. This means that the splats participating in the optimization process differ in each frame, to improve the realism of fine details. Compared with network-based methods, our method achieves better results with shorter training time. Compared with mesh-based methods, our method produces more realistic details within the same training time. Additionally, the ablation experiment confirms that our method effectively enhances the quality of details.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve the target image based on a reference image and a text description without requiring in-distribution triplets for training. One prevalent approach follows the vision-language pretraining paradigm that employs a mapping network to transfer the image embedding to a pseudo-word token in the text embedding space. However, this approach tends to impede network generalization due to modality discrepancy and distribution shift between training and inference. To this end, we propose a Data-efficient Generalization (DeG) framework, including two novel designs, namely, Textual Supplement (TS) module and Semantic-Set (S-Set). The TS module exploits compositional textual semantics during training, enhancing the pseudo-word token with more linguistic semantics and thus mitigating the modality discrepancy effectively. The S-Set exploits the zero-shot capability of pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), alleviating the distribution shift and mitigating the overfitting issue from the redundancy of the large-scale image-text data. Extensive experiments over four ZS-CIR benchmarks show that DeG outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with much less training data, and saves substantial training and inference time for practical usage.

- **Summary**: The growing rate of chronic wound occurrence, especially in patients with diabetes, has become a concerning trend in recent years. Chronic wounds are difficult and costly to treat, and have become a serious burden on health care systems worldwide. Chronic wounds can have devastating consequences for the patient, with infection often leading to reduced quality of life and increased mortality risk. Innovative deep learning methods for the detection and monitoring of such wounds have the potential to reduce the impact to both patient and clinician. We present a novel multimodal segmentation method which allows for the introduction of patient metadata into the training workflow whereby the patient data are expressed as Gaussian random fields. Our results indicate that the proposed method improved performance when utilising multiple models, each trained on different metadata categories. Using the Diabetic Foot Ulcer Challenge 2022 test set, when compared to the baseline results (intersection over union = 0.4670, Dice similarity coefficient = 0.5908) we demonstrate improvements of +0.0220 and +0.0229 for intersection over union and Dice similarity coefficient respectively. This paper presents the first study to focus on integrating patient data into a chronic wound segmentation workflow. Our results show significant performance gains when training individual models using specific metadata categories, followed by average merging of prediction masks using distance transforms.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes Separability Membrane, a robust 3D active contour for extracting a surface from 3D point cloud object. Our approach defines the surface of a 3D object as the boundary that maximizes the separability of point features, such as intensity, color, or local density, between its inner and outer regions based on Fisher's ratio. Separability Membrane identifies the exact surface of a 3D object by maximizing class separability while controlling the rigidity of the 3D surface model with an adaptive B-spline surface that adjusts its properties based on the local and global separability. A key advantage of our method is its ability to accurately reconstruct surface boundaries even when they are ambiguous due to noise or outliers, without requiring any training data or conversion to volumetric representation. Evaluations on a synthetic 3D point cloud dataset and the 3DNet dataset demonstrate the membrane's effectiveness and robustness under diverse conditions.

- **Summary**: Video-to-speech (V2S) synthesis, the task of generating speech directly from silent video input, is inherently more challenging than other speech synthesis tasks due to the need to accurately reconstruct both speech content and speaker characteristics from visual cues alone. Recently, audio-visual pre-training has eliminated the need for additional acoustic hints in V2S, which previous methods often relied on to ensure training convergence. However, even with pre-training, existing methods continue to face challenges in achieving a balance between acoustic intelligibility and the preservation of speaker-specific characteristics. We analyzed this limitation and were motivated to introduce DiVISe (Direct Visual-Input Speech Synthesis), an end-to-end V2S model that predicts Mel-spectrograms directly from video frames alone. Despite not taking any acoustic hints, DiVISe effectively preserves speaker characteristics in the generated audio, and achieves superior performance on both objective and subjective metrics across the LRS2 and LRS3 datasets. Our results demonstrate that DiVISe not only outperforms existing V2S models in acoustic intelligibility but also scales more effectively with increased data and model parameters.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in human preference alignment have significantly enhanced multimodal generation and understanding. A key approach is training reward models to guide preference optimization. However, existing models are often task-specific, limiting their adaptability across diverse visual applications. We also argue that jointly learning to assess multiple tasks may foster a synergistic effect, where improved image understanding enhances image generation assessment, and refined image evaluation benefits video assessment through better frame analysis. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward, the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation assessment, enabling both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, which can be employed for vision model preference alignment. Specifically, (1) we first develop UnifiedReward on our constructed large-scale human preference dataset, including both image and video generation/understanding tasks. (2) Then, it is utilized to automatically construct high-quality preference pair data based on the vision models, fine-gradually filtering their outputs through pair ranking and point sifting. (3) Finally, these data are used for their preference alignment through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results demonstrate that joint learning to assess diverse visual tasks can lead to substantial mutual benefits and we apply our pipeline to both image and video understanding/generation tasks, significantly improving the performance in each domain.

- **Summary**: Accurate analysis of prenatal ultrasound (US) is essential for early detection of developmental anomalies. However, operator dependency and technical limitations (e.g. intrinsic artefacts and effects, setting errors) can complicate image interpretation and the assessment of diagnostic uncertainty. We present L-FUSION (Laplacian Fetal US Segmentation with Integrated FoundatiON models), a framework that integrates uncertainty quantification through unsupervised, normative learning and large-scale foundation models for robust segmentation of fetal structures in normal and pathological scans. We propose to utilise the aleatoric logit distributions of Stochastic Segmentation Networks and Laplace approximations with fast Hessian estimations to estimate epistemic uncertainty only from the segmentation head. This enables us to achieve reliable abnormality quantification for instant diagnostic feedback. Combined with an integrated Dropout component, L-FUSION enables reliable differentiation of lesions from normal fetal anatomy with enhanced uncertainty maps and segmentation counterfactuals in US imaging. It improves epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty interpretation and removes the need for manual disease-labelling. Evaluations across multiple datasets show that L-FUSION achieves superior segmentation accuracy and consistent uncertainty quantification, supporting on-site decision-making and offering a scalable solution for advancing fetal ultrasound analysis in clinical settings.

- **Summary**: Finger photo Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) can significantly strengthen smartphone device security. However, these algorithms are trained to detect certain types of attacks. Furthermore, they are designed to operate on images acquired by specific capture devices, leading to poor generalization and a lack of robustness in handling the evolving nature of mobile hardware. The proposed investigation is the first to systematically analyze the performance degradation of existing deep learning PAD systems, convolutional and transformers, in cross-capture device settings. In this paper, we introduce the ColFigPhotoAttnNet architecture designed based on window attention on color channels, followed by the nested residual network as the predictor to achieve a reliable PAD. Extensive experiments using various capture devices, including iPhone13 Pro, GooglePixel 3, Nokia C5, and OnePlusOne, were carried out to evaluate the performance of proposed and existing methods on three publicly available databases. The findings underscore the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: While previous multimodal slow-thinking methods have demonstrated remarkable success in single-image understanding scenarios, their effectiveness becomes fundamentally constrained when extended to more complex multi-image comprehension tasks. This limitation stems from their predominant reliance on text-based intermediate reasoning processes. While for human, when engaging in sophisticated multi-image analysis, they typically perform two complementary cognitive operations: (1) continuous cross-image visual comparison through region-of-interest matching, and (2) dynamic memorization of critical visual concepts throughout the reasoning chain. Motivated by these observations, we propose the Complex Multi-Modal Chain-of-Thought (CMMCoT) framework, a multi-step reasoning framework that mimics human-like "slow thinking" for multi-image understanding. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: 1. The construction of interleaved multimodal multi-step reasoning chains, which utilize critical visual region tokens, extracted from intermediate reasoning steps, as supervisory signals. This mechanism not only facilitates comprehensive cross-modal understanding but also enhances model interpretability. 2. The introduction of a test-time memory augmentation module that expands the model reasoning capacity during inference while preserving parameter efficiency. Furthermore, to facilitate research in this direction, we have curated a novel multi-image slow-thinking dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

- **Summary**: Recent works have shown that, when trained at scale, uni-modal 2D vision and text encoders converge to learned features that share remarkable structural properties, despite arising from different representations. However, the role of 3D encoders with respect to other modalities remains unexplored. Furthermore, existing 3D foundation models that leverage large datasets are typically trained with explicit alignment objectives with respect to frozen encoders from other representations. In this work, we investigate the possibility of a posteriori alignment of representations obtained from uni-modal 3D encoders compared to text-based feature spaces. We show that naive post-training feature alignment of uni-modal text and 3D encoders results in limited performance. We then focus on extracting subspaces of the corresponding feature spaces and discover that by projecting learned representations onto well-chosen lower-dimensional subspaces the quality of alignment becomes significantly higher, leading to improved accuracy on matching and retrieval tasks. Our analysis further sheds light on the nature of these shared subspaces, which roughly separate between semantic and geometric data representations. Overall, ours is the first work that helps to establish a baseline for post-training alignment of 3D uni-modal and text feature spaces, and helps to highlight both the shared and unique properties of 3D data compared to other representations.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the use of partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) for encrypted vector similarity search, with a focus on facial recognition and broader applications like reverse image search, recommendation engines, and large language models (LLMs). While fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) exists, we demonstrate that encrypted cosine similarity can be computed using PHE, offering a more practical alternative. Since PHE does not directly support cosine similarity, we propose a method that normalizes vectors in advance, enabling dot product calculations as a proxy. We also apply min-max normalization to handle negative dimension values.   Experiments on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset use DeepFace's FaceNet128d, FaceNet512d, and VGG-Face (4096d) models in a two-tower setup. Pre-encrypted embeddings are stored in one tower, while an edge device captures images, computes embeddings, and performs encrypted-plaintext dot products via additively homomorphic encryption. We implement this with LightPHE, evaluating Paillier, Damgard-Jurik, and Okamoto-Uchiyama schemes, excluding others due to performance or decryption complexity. Tests at 80-bit and 112-bit security (NIST-secure until 2030) compare PHE against FHE (via TenSEAL), analyzing encryption, decryption, operation time, cosine similarity loss, key/ciphertext sizes.   Results show PHE is less computationally intensive, faster, and produces smaller ciphertexts/keys, making it well-suited for memory-constrained environments and real-world privacy-preserving encrypted similarity search.

- **Summary**: Autoregressive (AR) models for image generation typically adopt a two-stage paradigm of vector quantization and raster-scan ``next-token prediction", inspired by its great success in language modeling. However, due to the huge modality gap, image autoregressive models may require a systematic reevaluation from two perspectives: tokenizer format and regression direction. In this paper, we introduce the frequency progressive autoregressive (\textbf{FAR}) paradigm and instantiate FAR with the continuous tokenizer. Specifically, we identify spectral dependency as the desirable regression direction for FAR, wherein higher-frequency components build upon the lower one to progressively construct a complete image. This design seamlessly fits the causality requirement for autoregressive models and preserves the unique spatial locality of image data. Besides, we delve into the integration of FAR and the continuous tokenizer, introducing a series of techniques to address optimization challenges and improve the efficiency of training and inference processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of FAR through comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset and verify its potential on text-to-image generation.

- **Summary**: This paper discusses how ophthalmologists often rely on multimodal data to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT), blood residues and gas bubbles cause attenuation artifacts that can obscure critical vessel structures. The presence and severity of these artifacts may warrant re-acquisition, prolonging procedure time and increasing use of contrast agent. Accurate detection of these artifacts can guide targeted re-acquisition, reducing the amount of repeated scans needed to achieve diagnostically viable images. However, the highly heterogeneous appearance of these artifacts poses a challenge for the automated detection of the affected image regions. To enable automatic detection of the attenuation artifacts caused by blood residues and gas bubbles based on their severity, we propose a convolutional neural network that performs classification of the attenuation lines (A-lines) into three classes: no artifact, mild artifact and severe artifact. Our model extracts and merges features from OCT images in both Cartesian and polar coordinates, where each column of the image represents an A-line. Our method detects the presence of attenuation artifacts in OCT frames reaching F-scores of 0.77 and 0.94 for mild and severe artifacts, respectively. The inference time over a full OCT scan is approximately 6 seconds. Our experiments show that analysis of images represented in both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems outperforms the analysis in polar coordinates only, suggesting that these representations contain complementary features. This work lays the foundation for automated artifact assessment and image acquisition guidance in intracoronary OCT imaging.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for their high-quality novel view rendering, motivating research to address real-world challenges. A critical issue is the camera motion blur caused by movement during exposure, which hinders accurate 3D scene reconstruction. In this study, we propose CoMoGaussian, a Continuous Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting that reconstructs precise 3D scenes from motion-blurred images while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Considering the complex motion patterns inherent in real-world camera movements, we predict continuous camera trajectories using neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To ensure accurate modeling, we employ rigid body transformations, preserving the shape and size of the object but rely on the discrete integration of sampled frames. To better approximate the continuous nature of motion blur, we introduce a continuous motion refinement (CMR) transformation that refines rigid transformations by incorporating additional learnable parameters. By revisiting fundamental camera theory and leveraging advanced neural ODE techniques, we achieve precise modeling of continuous camera trajectories, leading to improved reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmark datasets, which include a wide range of motion blur scenarios, from moderate to extreme blur.

- **Summary**: The image-to-image translation abilities of generative learning models have recently made significant progress in the estimation of complex (steered) mappings between image distributions. While appearance based tasks like image in-painting or style transfer have been studied at length, we propose to investigate the potential of generative models in the context of physical simulations. Providing a dataset of 300k image-pairs and baseline evaluations for three different physical simulation tasks, we propose a benchmark to investigate the following research questions: i) are generative models able to learn complex physical relations from input-output image pairs? ii) what speedups can be achieved by replacing differential equation based simulations? While baseline evaluations of different current models show the potential for high speedups (ii), these results also show strong limitations toward the physical correctness (i). This underlines the need for new methods to enforce physical correctness. Data, baseline models and evaluation code http://www.physics-gen.org.

- **Summary**: The deformable registration of images of different modalities, essential in many medical imaging applications, remains challenging. The main challenge is developing a robust measure for image overlap despite the compared images capturing different aspects of the underlying tissue. Here, we explore similarity metrics based on functional dependence between intensity values of registered images. Although functional dependence is too restrictive on the global scale, earlier work has shown competitive performance in deformable registration when such measures are applied over small enough contexts. We confirm this finding and further develop the idea by modeling local functional dependence via the linear basis function model with the basis functions learned jointly with the deformation. The measure can be implemented via convolutions, making it efficient to compute on GPUs. We release the method as an easy-to-use tool and show good performance on three datasets compared to well-established baseline and earlier functional dependence-based methods.

- **Summary**: Given the scarcity and cost of high-field MRI, the synthesis of high-field MRI from low-field MRI holds significant potential when there is limited data for training downstream tasks (e.g. segmentation). Low-field MRI often suffers from a reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution compared to high-field MRI. However, synthesizing high-field MRI data presents challenges. These involve aligning image features across domains while preserving anatomical accuracy and enhancing fine details. To address these challenges, we propose a Pretext Task Adversarial (PTA) learning framework for high-field MRI synthesis from low-field MRI data. The framework comprises three processes: (1) The slice-wise gap perception (SGP) network aligns the slice inconsistencies of low-field and high-field datasets based on contrastive learning. (2) The local structure correction (LSC) network extracts local structures by restoring the locally rotated and masked images. (3) The pretext task-guided adversarial training process introduces additional supervision and incorporates a discriminator to improve image realism. Extensive experiments on low-field to ultra high-field task demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance (16.892 in FID, 1.933 in IS, and 0.324 in MS-SSIM). This enables the generation of high-quality high-field-like MRI data from low-field MRI data to augment training datasets for downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Human pose estimation, with its broad applications in action recognition and motion capture, has experienced significant advancements. However, current Transformer-based methods for video pose estimation often face challenges in managing redundant temporal information and achieving fine-grained perception because they only focus on processing low-resolution features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale resolution framework that encodes spatio-temporal representations at varying granularities and executes fine-grained perception compensation. Furthermore, we employ a density peaks clustering method to dynamically identify and prioritize tokens that offer important semantic information. This strategy effectively prunes redundant feature tokens, especially those arising from multi-frame features, thereby optimizing computational efficiency without sacrificing semantic richness. Empirically, it sets new benchmarks for both performance and efficiency on three large-scale datasets. Our method achieves a 93.8% improvement in inference speed compared to the baseline, while also enhancing pose estimation accuracy, reaching 87.4 mAP on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present the first application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to an Omni-multimodal large language model in the context of emotion recognition, a task where both visual and audio modalities play crucial roles. We leverage RLVR to optimize the Omni model, significantly enhancing its performance in three key aspects: reasoning capability, emotion recognition accuracy, and generalization ability. The introduction of RLVR not only improves the model's overall performance on in-distribution data but also demonstrates superior robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution datasets. More importantly, the improved reasoning capability enables clear analysis of the contributions of different modalities, particularly visual and audio information, in the emotion recognition process. This provides valuable insights into the optimization of multimodal large language models.

- **Summary**: Self-modeling enables robots to build task-agnostic models of their morphology and kinematics based on data that can be automatically collected, with minimal human intervention and prior information, thereby enhancing machine intelligence. Recent research has highlighted the potential of data-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots. However, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality or excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture is also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and remains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level method is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D) Gaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster the 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are controlled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural network. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data pairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without depth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles, we can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology, kinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images from different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the established model can be exploited to perform downstream tasks such as motion planning and inverse kinematics.

- **Summary**: Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn from distinct categories without retaining exemplars but easily suffers from catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate classifier training as a reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, across various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models achieve high predictive performance but lack intrinsic interpretability, hindering our understanding of the learned prediction behavior. Existing local explainability methods focus on associations, neglecting the causal drivers of model predictions. Other approaches adopt a causal perspective but primarily provide more general global explanations. However, for specific inputs, it's unclear whether globally identified factors apply locally. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework for local interventional explanations by leveraging recent advances in image-to-image editing models. Our approach performs gradual interventions on semantic properties to quantify the corresponding impact on a model's predictions using a novel score, the expected property gradient magnitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an extensive empirical evaluation on a wide range of architectures and tasks. First, we validate it in a synthetic scenario and demonstrate its ability to locally identify biases. Afterward, we apply our approach to analyze network training dynamics, investigate medical skin lesion classifiers, and study a pre-trained CLIP model with real-life interventional data. Our results highlight the potential of interventional explanations on the property level to reveal new insights into the behavior of deep models.

- **Summary**: Automating teaching presents unique challenges, as replicating human interaction and adaptability is complex. Automated systems cannot often provide nuanced, real-time feedback that aligns with students' individual learning paces or comprehension levels, which can hinder effective support for diverse needs. This is especially challenging in fields where abstract concepts require adaptive explanations. In this paper, we propose a vision language retrieval augmented generation (named VL-RAG) system that has the potential to bridge this gap by delivering contextually relevant, visually enriched responses that can enhance comprehension. By leveraging a database of tailored answers and images, the VL-RAG system can dynamically retrieve information aligned with specific questions, creating a more interactive and engaging experience that fosters deeper understanding and active student participation. It allows students to explore concepts visually and verbally, promoting deeper understanding and reducing the need for constant human oversight while maintaining flexibility to expand across different subjects and course material.

- **Summary**: We present DecoupledGaussian, a novel system that decouples static objects from their contacted surfaces captured in-the-wild videos, a key prerequisite for realistic Newtonian-based physical simulations. Unlike prior methods focused on synthetic data or elastic jittering along the contact surface, which prevent objects from fully detaching or moving independently, DecoupledGaussian allows for significant positional changes without being constrained by the initial contacted surface. Recognizing the limitations of current 2D inpainting tools for restoring 3D locations, our approach proposes joint Poisson fields to repair and expand the Gaussians of both objects and contacted scenes after separation. This is complemented by a multi-carve strategy to refine the object's geometry. Our system enables realistic simulations of decoupling motions, collisions, and fractures driven by user-specified impulses, supporting complex interactions within and across multiple scenes. We validate DecoupledGaussian through a comprehensive user study and quantitative benchmarks. This system enhances digital interaction with objects and scenes in real-world environments, benefiting industries such as VR, robotics, and autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Reconstruction of high-definition maps is a crucial task in perceiving the autonomous driving environment, as its accuracy directly impacts the reliability of prediction and planning capabilities in downstream modules. Current vectorized map reconstruction methods based on the DETR framework encounter limitations due to the redundancy in the decoder structure, necessitating the stacking of six decoder layers to maintain performance, which significantly hampers computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we introduce FastMap, an innovative framework designed to reduce decoder redundancy in existing approaches. FastMap optimizes the decoder architecture by employing a single-layer, two-stage transformer that achieves multilevel representation capabilities. Our framework eliminates the conventional practice of randomly initializing queries and instead incorporates a heatmap-guided query generation module during the decoding phase, which effectively maps image features into structured query vectors using learnable positional encoding. Additionally, we propose a geometry-constrained point-to-line loss mechanism for FastMap, which adeptly addresses the challenge of distinguishing highly homogeneous features that often arise in traditional point-to-point loss computations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastMap achieves state-of-the-art performance in both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, with its decoder operating 3.2 faster than the baseline. Code and more demos are available at https://github.com/hht1996ok/FastMap.

- **Summary**: One-class anomaly detection aims to detect objects that do not belong to a predefined normal class. In practice training data lack those anomalous samples; hence state-of-the-art methods are trained to discriminate between normal and synthetically-generated pseudo-anomalous data. Most methods use data augmentation techniques on normal images to simulate anomalies. However the best-performing ones implicitly leverage a geometric bias present in the benchmarking datasets. This limits their usability in more general conditions. Others are relying on basic noising schemes that may be suboptimal in capturing the underlying structure of normal data. In addition most still favour the image domain to generate pseudo-anomalies training models end-to-end from only the normal class and overlooking richer representations of the information. To overcome these limitations we consider frozen yet rich feature spaces given by pretrained models and create pseudo-anomalous features with a novel adaptive linear feature perturbation technique. It adapts the noise distribution to each sample applies decaying linear perturbations to feature vectors and further guides the classification process using a contrastive learning objective. Experimental evaluation conducted on both standard and geometric bias-free datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach with respect to comparable baselines. The codebase is accessible via our public repository.

- **Summary**: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are widely used to model human-understandable concepts as directions within the latent space of neural networks. They are trained by identifying directions from the activations of concept samples to those of non-concept samples. However, this method often produces similar, non-orthogonal directions for correlated concepts, such as "beard" and "necktie" within the CelebA dataset, which frequently co-occur in images of men. This entanglement complicates the interpretation of concepts in isolation and can lead to undesired effects in CAV applications, such as activation steering. To address this issue, we introduce a post-hoc concept disentanglement method that employs a non-orthogonality loss, facilitating the identification of orthogonal concept directions while preserving directional correctness. We evaluate our approach with real-world and controlled correlated concepts in CelebA and a synthetic FunnyBirds dataset with VGG16 and ResNet18 architectures. We further demonstrate the superiority of orthogonalized concept representations in activation steering tasks, allowing (1) the insertion of isolated concepts into input images through generative models and (2) the removal of concepts for effective shortcut suppression with reduced impact on correlated concepts in comparison to baseline CAVs.

- **Summary**: Efficient and accurate whole-brain lesion segmentation remains a challenge in medical image analysis. In this work, we revisit MeshNet, a parameter-efficient segmentation model, and introduce a novel multi-scale dilation pattern with an encoder-decoder structure. This innovation enables capturing broad contextual information and fine-grained details without traditional downsampling, upsampling, or skip-connections. Unlike previous approaches processing subvolumes or slices, we operate directly on whole-brain $256^3$ MRI volumes. Evaluations on the Aphasia Recovery Cohort (ARC) dataset demonstrate that MeshNet achieves superior or comparable DICE scores to state-of-the-art architectures such as MedNeXt and U-MAMBA at 1/1000th of parameters. Our results validate MeshNet's strong balance of efficiency and performance, making it particularly suitable for resource-limited environments such as web-based applications and opening new possibilities for the widespread deployment of advanced medical image analysis tools.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has revolutionized open-set interactive image segmentation, inspiring numerous adapters for the medical domain. However, SAM primarily relies on sparse prompts such as point or bounding box, which may be suboptimal for fine-grained instance segmentation, particularly in endoscopic imagery, where precise localization is critical and existing prompts struggle to capture object boundaries effectively. To address this, we introduce S4M (Segment Anything with 4 Extreme Points), which augments SAM by leveraging extreme points -- the top-, bottom-, left-, and right-most points of an instance -- prompts. These points are intuitive to identify and provide a faster, structured alternative to box prompts. However, a na\"ive use of extreme points degrades performance, due to SAM's inability to interpret their semantic roles. To resolve this, we introduce dedicated learnable embeddings, enabling the model to distinguish extreme points from generic free-form points and better reason about their spatial relationships. We further propose an auxiliary training task through the Canvas module, which operates solely on prompts -- without vision input -- to predict a coarse instance mask. This encourages the model to internalize the relationship between extreme points and mask distributions, leading to more robust segmentation. S4M outperforms other SAM-based approaches on three endoscopic surgical datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex scenarios. Finally, we validate our approach through a human annotation study on surgical endoscopic videos, confirming that extreme points are faster to acquire than bounding boxes.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of thin, tubular structures (e.g., blood vessels) is challenging for deep neural networks. These networks classify individual pixels, and even minor misclassifications can break the thin connections within these structures. Existing methods for improving topology accuracy, such as topology loss functions, rely on very precise, topologically-accurate training labels, which are difficult to obtain. This is because annotating images, especially 3D images, is extremely laborious and time-consuming. Low image resolution and contrast further complicates the annotation by causing tubular structures to appear disconnected. We present CoLeTra, a data augmentation strategy that integrates to the models the prior knowledge that structures that appear broken are actually connected. This is achieved by creating images with the appearance of disconnected structures while maintaining the original labels. Our extensive experiments, involving different architectures, loss functions, and datasets, demonstrate that CoLeTra leads to segmentations topologically more accurate while often improving the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance. CoLeTra's hyper-parameters are intuitive to tune, and our sensitivity analysis shows that CoLeTra is robust to changes in these hyper-parameters. We also release a dataset specifically suited for image segmentation methods with a focus on topology accuracy. CoLetra's code can be found at https://github.com/jmlipman/CoLeTra.

- **Summary**: Geometry problem solving has garnered increasing attention due to its potential applications in intelligent education field. Inspired by the observation that text often introduces ambiguities that diagrams can clarify, this paper presents Pi-GPS, a novel framework that unleashes the power of diagrammatic information to resolve textual ambiguities, an aspect largely overlooked in prior research. Specifically, we design a micro module comprising a rectifier and verifier: the rectifier employs MLLMs to disambiguate text based on the diagrammatic context, while the verifier ensures the rectified output adherence to geometric rules, mitigating model hallucinations. Additionally, we explore the impact of LLMs in theorem predictor based on the disambiguated formal language. Empirical results demonstrate that Pi-GPS surpasses state-of-the-art models, achieving a nearly 10\% improvement on Geometry3K over prior neural-symbolic approaches. We hope this work highlights the significance of resolving textual ambiguity in multimodal mathematical reasoning, a crucial factor limiting performance.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Stereo Any Video, a powerful framework for video stereo matching. It can estimate spatially accurate and temporally consistent disparities without relying on auxiliary information such as camera poses or optical flow. The strong capability is driven by rich priors from monocular video depth models, which are integrated with convolutional features to produce stable representations. To further enhance performance, key architectural innovations are introduced: all-to-all-pairs correlation, which constructs smooth and robust matching cost volumes, and temporal convex upsampling, which improves temporal coherence. These components collectively ensure robustness, accuracy, and temporal consistency, setting a new standard in video stereo matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively in zero-shot settings, as well as strong generalization to real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios.

- **Summary**: In tomato greenhouse, phenotypic measurement is meaningful for researchers and farmers to monitor crop growth, thereby precisely control environmental conditions in time, leading to better quality and higher yield. Traditional phenotyping mainly relies on manual measurement, which is accurate but inefficient, more importantly, endangering the health and safety of people. Several studies have explored computer vision-based methods to replace manual phenotyping. However, the 2D-based need extra calibration, or cause destruction to fruit, or can only measure limited and meaningless traits. The 3D-based need extra depth camera, which is expensive and unacceptable for most farmers. In this paper, we propose a non-contact tomato fruit phenotyping method, titled TomatoScanner, where RGB image is all you need for input. First, pixel feature is extracted by instance segmentation of our proposed EdgeYOLO with preprocessing of individual separation and pose correction. Second, depth feature is extracted by depth estimation of Depth Pro. Third, pixel and depth feature are fused to output phenotype results in reality. We establish self-built Tomato Phenotype Dataset to test TomatoScanner, which achieves excellent phenotyping on width, height, vertical area and volume, with median relative error of 5.63%, 7.03%, -0.64% and 37.06%, respectively. We propose and add three innovative modules - EdgeAttention, EdgeLoss and EdgeBoost - into EdgeYOLO, to enhance the segmentation accuracy on edge portion. Precision and mean Edge Error greatly improve from 0.943 and 5.641% to 0.986 and 2.963%, respectively. Meanwhile, EdgeYOLO keeps lightweight and efficient, with 48.7 M weights size and 76.34 FPS.

- **Summary**: Existing novel object 6D pose estimation methods typically rely on CAD models or dense reference views, which are both difficult to acquire. Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in the camera coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative camera-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting. Code will be released at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/SinRef-6D.

- **Summary**: One-step diffusion-based image super-resolution (OSDSR) models are showing increasingly superior performance nowadays. However, although their denoising steps are reduced to one and they can be quantized to 8-bit to reduce the costs further, there is still significant potential for OSDSR to quantize to lower bits. To explore more possibilities of quantized OSDSR, we propose an efficient method, Quantization via reverse-module and timestep-retraining for OSDSR, named QArtSR. Firstly, we investigate the influence of timestep value on the performance of quantized models. Then, we propose Timestep Retraining Quantization (TRQ) and Reversed Per-module Quantization (RPQ) strategies to calibrate the quantized model. Meanwhile, we adopt the module and image losses to update all quantized modules. We only update the parameters in quantization finetuning components, excluding the original weights. To ensure that all modules are fully finetuned, we add extended end-to-end training after per-module stage. Our 4-bit and 2-bit quantization experimental results indicate that QArtSR obtains superior effects against the recent leading comparison methods. The performance of 4-bit QArtSR is close to the full-precision one. Our code will be released at https://github.com/libozhu03/QArtSR.

- **Summary**: Although diffusion-based techniques have shown remarkable success in image generation and editing tasks, their abuse can lead to severe negative social impacts. Recently, some works have been proposed to provide defense against the abuse of diffusion-based methods. However, their protection may be limited in specific scenarios by manually defined prompts or the stable diffusion (SD) version. Furthermore, these methods solely focus on tuning methods, overlooking editing methods that could also pose a significant threat. In this work, we propose Anti-Diffusion, a privacy protection system designed for general diffusion-based methods, applicable to both tuning and editing techniques. To mitigate the limitations of manually defined prompts on defense performance, we introduce the prompt tuning (PT) strategy that enables precise expression of original images. To provide defense against both tuning and editing methods, we propose the semantic disturbance loss (SDL) to disrupt the semantic information of protected images. Given the limited research on the defense against editing methods, we develop a dataset named Defense-Edit to assess the defense performance of various methods. Experiments demonstrate that our Anti-Diffusion achieves superior defense performance across a wide range of diffusion-based techniques in different scenarios.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful approach for video representation, offering versatility across tasks such as compression and inpainting. However, their implicit formulation limits both interpretability and efficacy, undermining their practicality as a comprehensive solution. We propose a novel video representation based on deformable 2D Gaussian splatting, dubbed D2GV, which aims to achieve three key objectives: 1) improved efficiency while delivering superior quality; 2) enhanced scalability and interpretability; and 3) increased friendliness for downstream tasks. Specifically, we initially divide the video sequence into fixed-length Groups of Pictures (GoP) to allow parallel training and linear scalability with video length. For each GoP, D2GV represents video frames by applying differentiable rasterization to 2D Gaussians, which are deformed from a canonical space into their corresponding timestamps. Notably, leveraging efficient CUDA-based rasterization, D2GV converges fast and decodes at speeds exceeding 400 FPS, while delivering quality that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art INRs. Moreover, we incorporate a learnable pruning and quantization strategy to streamline D2GV into a more compact representation. We demonstrate D2GV's versatility in tasks including video interpolation, inpainting and denoising, underscoring its potential as a promising solution for video representation.

- **Summary**: Cardiac ultrasound (US) scanning is a commonly used techniques in cardiology to diagnose the health of the heart and its proper functioning. Therefore, it is necessary to consider ways to automate these tasks and assist medical professionals in classifying and assessing cardiac US images. Machine learning (ML) techniques are regarded as a prominent solution due to their success in numerous applications aimed at enhancing the medical field, including addressing the shortage of echography technicians. However, the limited availability of medical data presents a significant barrier to applying ML in cardiology, particularly regarding US images of the heart. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing the first open graded dataset for Cardiac Assessment and ClassificaTion of UltraSound (CACTUS), which is available online. This dataset contains images obtained from scanning a CAE Blue Phantom and representing various heart views and different quality levels, exceeding the conventional cardiac views typically found in the literature. Additionally, the paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL) framework consisting of two main components. The first component classifies cardiac US images based on the heart view using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The second component uses Transfer Learning (TL) to fine-tune the knowledge from the first component and create a model for grading and assessing cardiac images. The framework demonstrates high performance in both classification and grading, achieving up to 99.43% accuracy and as low as 0.3067 error, respectively. To showcase its robustness, the framework is further fine-tuned using new images representing additional cardiac views and compared to several other state-of-the-art architectures. The framework's outcomes and performance in handling real-time scans were also assessed using a questionnaire answered by cardiac experts.

- **Summary**: Image segmentation is a challenging task influenced by multiple sources of uncertainty, such as the data labeling process or the sampling of training data. In this paper we focus on binary segmentation and address these challenges using conformal prediction, a family of model- and data-agnostic methods for uncertainty quantification that provide finite-sample theoretical guarantees and applicable to any pretrained predictor. Our approach involves computing nonconformity scores, a type of prediction residual, on held-out calibration data not used during training. We use dilation, one of the fundamental operations in mathematical morphology, to construct a margin added to the borders of predicted segmentation masks. At inference, the predicted set formed by the mask and its margin contains the ground-truth mask with high probability, at a confidence level specified by the user. The size of the margin serves as an indicator of predictive uncertainty for a given model and dataset. We work in a regime of minimal information as we do not require any feedback from the predictor: only the predicted masks are needed for computing the prediction sets. Hence, our method is applicable to any segmentation model, including those based on deep learning; we evaluate our approach on several medical imaging applications.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence has shown the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy through medical image analysis for pneumonia diagnosis. However, traditional multimodal approaches often fail to address real-world challenges such as incomplete data and modality loss. In this study, a Flexible Multimodal Transformer (FMT) was proposed, which uses ResNet-50 and BERT for joint representation learning, followed by a dynamic masked attention strategy that simulates clinical modality loss to improve robustness; finally, a sequential mixture of experts (MOE) architecture was used to achieve multi-level decision refinement. After evaluation on a small multimodal pneumonia dataset, FMT achieved state-of-the-art performance with 94% accuracy, 95% recall, and 93% F1 score, outperforming single-modal baselines (ResNet: 89%; BERT: 79%) and the medical benchmark CheXMed (90%), providing a scalable solution for multimodal diagnosis of pneumonia in resource-constrained medical settings.

- **Summary**: Modern orchards are planted in structured rows with distinct panel divisions to improve management. Accurate and efficient joint segmentation of point cloud from Panel to Tree and Branch (P2TB) is essential for robotic operations. However, most current segmentation methods focus on single instance segmentation and depend on a sequence of deep networks to perform joint tasks. This strategy hinders the use of hierarchical information embedded in the data, leading to both error accumulation and increased costs for annotation and computation, which limits its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we proposed a novel approach that incorporated a Real2Sim L-TreeGen for training data generation and a joint model (J-P2TB) designed for the P2TB task. The J-P2TB model, trained on the generated simulation dataset, was used for joint segmentation of real-world panel point clouds via zero-shot learning. Compared to representative methods, our model outperformed them in most segmentation metrics while using 40% fewer learnable parameters. This Sim2Real result highlighted the efficacy of L-TreeGen in model training and the performance of J-P2TB for joint segmentation, demonstrating its strong accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability for real-world applications. These improvements would not only greatly benefit the development of robots for automated orchard operations but also advance digital twin technology.

- **Summary**: We present TrajectoryCrafter, a novel approach to redirect camera trajectories for monocular videos. By disentangling deterministic view transformations from stochastic content generation, our method achieves precise control over user-specified camera trajectories. We propose a novel dual-stream conditional video diffusion model that concurrently integrates point cloud renders and source videos as conditions, ensuring accurate view transformations and coherent 4D content generation. Instead of leveraging scarce multi-view videos, we curate a hybrid training dataset combining web-scale monocular videos with static multi-view datasets, by our innovative double-reprojection strategy, significantly fostering robust generalization across diverse scenes. Extensive evaluations on multi-view and large-scale monocular videos demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

- **Summary**: Video inpainting, which aims to restore corrupted video content, has experienced substantial progress. Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.

- **Summary**: Real-world household tasks present significant challenges for mobile manipulation robots. An analysis of existing robotics benchmarks reveals that successful task performance hinges on three key whole-body control capabilities: bimanual coordination, stable and precise navigation, and extensive end-effector reachability. Achieving these capabilities requires careful hardware design, but the resulting system complexity further complicates visuomotor policy learning. To address these challenges, we introduce the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for whole-body manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual, wheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies. We evaluate BRS on five challenging household tasks that not only emphasize the three core capabilities but also introduce additional complexities, such as long-range navigation, interaction with articulated and deformable objects, and manipulation in confined spaces. We believe that BRS's integrated robotic embodiment, data collection interface, and learning framework mark a significant step toward enabling real-world whole-body manipulation for everyday household tasks.

- **Summary**: Federated unlearning (FU) aims to remove a participant's data contributions from a trained federated learning (FL) model, ensuring privacy and regulatory compliance. Traditional FU methods often depend on auxiliary storage on either the client or server side or require direct access to the data targeted for removal-a dependency that may not be feasible if the data is no longer available. To overcome these limitations, we propose NoT, a novel and efficient FU algorithm based on weight negation (multiplying by -1), which circumvents the need for additional storage and access to the target data. We argue that effective and efficient unlearning can be achieved by perturbing model parameters away from the set of optimal parameters, yet being well-positioned for quick re-optimization. This technique, though seemingly contradictory, is theoretically grounded: we prove that the weight negation perturbation effectively disrupts inter-layer co-adaptation, inducing unlearning while preserving an approximate optimality property, thereby enabling rapid recovery.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative models have sparked research on improving model fairness with AI-generated data. However, existing methods often face limitations in the diversity and quality of synthetic data, leading to compromised fairness and overall model accuracy. Moreover, many approaches rely on the availability of demographic group labels, which are often costly to annotate. This paper proposes AIM-Fair, aiming to overcome these limitations and harness the potential of cutting-edge generative models in promoting algorithmic fairness. We investigate a fine-tuning paradigm starting from a biased model initially trained on real-world data without demographic annotations. This model is then fine-tuned using unbiased synthetic data generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model to improve its fairness. Two key challenges are identified in this fine-tuning paradigm, 1) the low quality of synthetic data, which can still happen even with advanced generative models, and 2) the domain and bias gap between real and synthetic data. To address the limitation of synthetic data quality, we propose Contextual Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG) to generate data using a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I) with prompts generated by a context-aware LLM, ensuring both data diversity and control of bias in synthetic data. To resolve domain and bias shifts, we introduce a novel selective fine-tuning scheme in which only model parameters more sensitive to bias and less sensitive to domain shift are updated. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace datasets show that our AIM-Fair improves model fairness while maintaining utility, outperforming both fully and partially fine-tuned approaches to model fairness.

- **Summary**: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in brain tumor segmentation and diagnosis by leveraging complementary information from different contrasts. Each contrast highlights specific tumor characteristics, enabling a comprehensive understanding of tumor morphology, edema, and pathological heterogeneity. However, existing methods still face the challenges of multi-level specificity perception across different contrasts, especially with limited annotations. These challenges include data heterogeneity, granularity differences, and interference from redundant information. To address these limitations, we propose a Task-oriented Uncertainty Collaborative Learning (TUCL) framework for multi-contrast MRI segmentation. TUCL introduces a task-oriented prompt attention (TPA) module with intra-prompt and cross-prompt attention mechanisms to dynamically model feature interactions across contrasts and tasks. Additionally, a cyclic process is designed to map the predictions back to the prompt to ensure that the prompts are effectively utilized. In the decoding stage, the TUCL framework proposes a dual-path uncertainty refinement (DUR) strategy which ensures robust segmentation by refining predictions iteratively. Extensive experimental results on limited labeled data demonstrate that TUCL significantly improves segmentation accuracy (88.2\% in Dice and 10.853 mm in HD95). It shows that TUCL has the potential to extract multi-contrast information and reduce the reliance on extensive annotations.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained foundation models can be adapted for specific tasks using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, the fairness properties of these adapted classifiers remain underexplored. Existing fairness-aware fine-tuning methods rely on direct access to sensitive attributes or their predictors, but in practice, these sensitive attributes are often held under strict consumer privacy controls, and neither the attributes nor their predictors are available to model developers, hampering the development of fair models. To address this issue, we introduce a set of LoRA-based fine-tuning methods that can be trained in a distributed fashion, where model developers and fairness auditors collaborate without sharing sensitive attributes or predictors. In this paper, we evaluate three such methods - sensitive unlearning, adversarial training, and orthogonality loss - against a fairness-unaware baseline, using experiments on the CelebA and UTK-Face datasets with an ImageNet pre-trained ViT-Base model. We find that orthogonality loss consistently reduces bias while maintaining or improving utility, whereas adversarial training improves False Positive Rate Parity and Demographic Parity in some cases, and sensitive unlearning provides no clear benefit. In tasks where significant biases are present, distributed fairness-aware fine-tuning methods can effectively eliminate bias without compromising consumer privacy and, in most cases, improve model utility.

- **Summary**: We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

- **Summary**: Vision-based autonomous racing relies on accurate perception for robust control. However, image distribution changes caused by sensor noise, adverse weather, and dynamic lighting can degrade perception, leading to suboptimal control decisions. Existing approaches, including domain adaptation and adversarial training, improve robustness but struggle to generalize to unseen corruptions while introducing computational overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a real-time image repair module that restores corrupted images before they are used by the controller. Our method leverages generative adversarial models, specifically CycleGAN and pix2pix, for image repair. CycleGAN enables unpaired image-to-image translation to adapt to novel corruptions, while pix2pix exploits paired image data when available to improve the quality. To ensure alignment with control performance, we introduce a control-focused loss function that prioritizes perceptual consistency in repaired images. We evaluated our method in a simulated autonomous racing environment with various visual corruptions. The results show that our approach significantly improves performance compared to baselines, mitigating distribution shift and enhancing controller reliability.



### SAS: Segment Anything Small for Ultrasound -- A Non-Generative Data Augmentation Technique for Robust Deep Learning in Ultrasound Imaging

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in ultrasound (US) images, particularly small ones, is challenging due to noise and variability in imaging conditions (e.g., probe position, patient anatomy, tissue characteristics and pathology). To address this, we introduce Segment Anything Small (SAS), a simple yet effective scale- and texture-aware data augmentation technique designed to enhance the performance of deep learning models for segmenting small anatomical structures in ultrasound images. SAS employs a dual transformation strategy: (1) simulating diverse organ scales by resizing and embedding organ thumbnails into a black background, and (2) injecting noise into regions of interest to simulate varying tissue textures. These transformations generate realistic and diverse training data without introducing hallucinations or artifacts, improving the model's robustness to noise and variability. We fine-tuned a promptable foundation model on a controlled organ-specific medical imaging dataset and evaluated its performance on one internal and five external datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance, with Dice score gains of up to 0.35 and an average improvement of 0.16 [95% CI 0.132,0.188]. Additionally, our iterative point prompts provide precise control and adaptive refinement, achieving performance comparable to bounding box prompts with just two points. SAS enhances model robustness and generalizability across diverse anatomical structures and imaging conditions, particularly for small structures, without compromising the accuracy of larger ones. By offering a computationally efficient solution that eliminates the need for extensive human labeling efforts, SAS emerges as a powerful tool for advancing medical image analysis, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose an extreme compression technique for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). While previous studies have explored quantization as an efficient post-training compression method for Large Language Models (LLMs), low-bit compression for multimodal models remains under-explored. The redundant nature of inputs in multimodal models results in a highly sparse attention matrix. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the attention matrix's sparsity bounds the compression error of the Query and Key weight matrices. Based on this, we introduce CASP, a model compression technique for LMMs. Our approach performs a data-aware low-rank decomposition on the Query and Key weight matrix, followed by quantization across all layers based on an optimal bit allocation process. CASP is compatible with any quantization technique and enhances state-of-the-art 2-bit quantization methods (AQLM and QuIP#) by an average of 21% on image- and video-language benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Open-set semantic mapping requires (i) determining the correct granularity to represent the scene (e.g., how should objects be defined), and (ii) fusing semantic knowledge across multiple 2D observations into an overall 3D reconstruction -ideally with a high-fidelity yet low-memory footprint. While most related works bypass the first issue by grouping together primitives with similar semantics (according to some manually tuned threshold), we recognize that the object granularity is task-dependent, and develop a task-driven semantic mapping approach. To address the second issue, current practice is to average visual embedding vectors over multiple views. Instead, we show the benefits of using a probabilistic approach based on the properties of the underlying visual-language foundation model, and leveraging Bayesian updating to aggregate multiple observations of the scene. The result is Bayesian Fields, a task-driven and probabilistic approach for open-set semantic mapping. To enable high-fidelity objects and a dense scene representation, Bayesian Fields uses 3D Gaussians which we cluster into task-relevant objects, allowing for both easy 3D object extraction and reduced memory usage. We release Bayesian Fields open-source at https: //github.com/MIT-SPARK/Bayesian-Fields.

- **Summary**: Following recipes while cooking is an important but difficult task for visually impaired individuals. We developed OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a novel approach that provides recipe progress tracking and context-aware feedback on the completion of cooking tasks through tracking object statuses. OSCAR leverages both Large-Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to manipulate recipe steps, extract object status information, align visual frames with object status, and provide cooking progress tracking log. We evaluated OSCAR's recipe following functionality using 173 YouTube cooking videos and 12 real-world non-visual cooking videos to demonstrate OSCAR's capability to track cooking steps and provide contextual guidance. Our results highlight the effectiveness of using object status to improve performance compared to baseline by over 20% across different VLMs, and we present factors that impact prediction performance. Furthermore, we contribute a dataset of real-world non-visual cooking videos with step annotations as an evaluation benchmark.

- **Summary**: Contrast enhancement, a key aspect of image-to-image translation (I2IT), improves visual quality by adjusting intensity differences between pixels. However, many existing methods struggle to preserve fine-grained details, often leading to the loss of low-level features. This paper introduces LapLoss, a novel approach designed for I2IT contrast enhancement, based on the Laplacian pyramid-centric networks, forming the core of our proposed methodology. The proposed approach employs a multiple discriminator architecture, each operating at a different resolution to capture high-level features, in addition to maintaining low-level details and textures under mixed lighting conditions. The proposed methodology computes the loss at multiple scales, balancing reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality to enhance overall image generation. The distinct blend of the loss calculation at each level of the pyramid, combined with the architecture of the Laplacian pyramid enables LapLoss to exceed contemporary contrast enhancement techniques. This framework achieves state-of-the-art results, consistently performing well across different lighting conditions in the SICE dataset.

- **Summary**: As video language models (VLMs) gain more applications in various scenarios, the need for robust and scalable evaluation of their performance becomes increasingly critical. The traditional human expert-based evaluation of VLMs has limitations in consistency and scalability, which sparked interest in automatic methods such as employing VLMs to evaluate VLMs. However, the reliability of VLMs as judges remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on a single VLM as the evaluator. However, this approach can be unreliable or biased because such a model may lack the ability to fully understand the content and may have inherent biases, ultimately compromising evaluation reliability. A remedy is to apply the principle of collective thoughts, aggregating evaluations from multiple VLMs to enhance reliability. This study investigates the efficacy of such approaches, particularly when the pool of judges includes both reliable and unreliable models. Our findings reveal that incorporating collective judgments from such a mixed pool does not necessarily improve the accuracy of the final evaluation. The inclusion of less reliable judges can introduce noise, undermining the overall reliability of the outcomes. To explore the factors that impact evaluation reliability, we fine-tune an underperforming VLM judge, Video-LLaVA, and observe that improved understanding ability alone is insufficient to make VLM judges more reliable. These findings stress the limitations of collective thought approaches and highlight the need for more advanced methods that can account for the reliability of individual models. Our study promotes the development of more reliable evaluation methods for VLMs

- **Summary**: We present MagicInfinite, a novel diffusion Transformer (DiT) framework that overcomes traditional portrait animation limitations, delivering high-fidelity results across diverse character types-realistic humans, full-body figures, and stylized anime characters. It supports varied facial poses, including back-facing views, and animates single or multiple characters with input masks for precise speaker designation in multi-character scenes. Our approach tackles key challenges with three innovations: (1) 3D full-attention mechanisms with a sliding window denoising strategy, enabling infinite video generation with temporal coherence and visual quality across diverse character styles; (2) a two-stage curriculum learning scheme, integrating audio for lip sync, text for expressive dynamics, and reference images for identity preservation, enabling flexible multi-modal control over long sequences; and (3) region-specific masks with adaptive loss functions to balance global textual control and local audio guidance, supporting speaker-specific animations. Efficiency is enhanced via our innovative unified step and cfg distillation techniques, achieving a 20x inference speed boost over the basemodel: generating a 10 second 540x540p video in 10 seconds or 720x720p in 30 seconds on 8 H100 GPUs, without quality loss. Evaluations on our new benchmark demonstrate MagicInfinite's superiority in audio-lip synchronization, identity preservation, and motion naturalness across diverse scenarios.
