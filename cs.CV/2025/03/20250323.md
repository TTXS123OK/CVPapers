- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of the ventricles from cardiac magnetic resonance images (CMRIs) is crucial for enhancing the diagnosis and analysis of heart conditions. Deep learning-based segmentation methods have recently garnered significant attention due to their impressive performance. However, these segmentation methods are typically good at partitioning regularly shaped organs, such as the left ventricle (LV) and the myocardium (MYO), whereas they perform poorly on irregularly shaped organs, such as the right ventricle (RV). In this study, we argue that this limitation of segmentation models stems from their insufficient generalization ability to address the distribution shift of segmentation targets across slices, cardiac phases, and disease conditions. To overcome this issue, we present a Multi-Disease-Aware Training Strategy (MTS) and restructure the introduced CMRI datasets into multi-disease datasets. Additionally, we propose a specialized data processing technique for preprocessing input images to support the MTS. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we performed control group experiments and cross-validation tests. The experimental results show that (1) network models trained using our proposed strategy achieved superior segmentation performance, particularly in RV segmentation, and (2) these networks exhibited robust performance even when applied to data from unknown diseases.

- **Summary**: We present a real-time global illumination approach along with a pipeline for dynamic 3D Gaussian models and meshes. Building on a formulated surface light transport model for 3D Gaussians, we address key performance challenges with a fast compound stochastic ray-tracing algorithm and an optimized 3D Gaussian rasterizer. Our pipeline integrates multiple real-time techniques to accelerate performance and achieve high-quality lighting effects. Our approach enables real-time rendering of dynamic scenes with interactively editable materials and dynamic lighting of diverse multi-lights settings, capturing mutual multi-bounce light transport (indirect illumination) between 3D Gaussians and mesh. Additionally, we present a real-time renderer with an interactive user interface, validating our approach and demonstrating its practicality and high efficiency with over 40 fps in scenes including both 3D Gaussians and mesh. Furthermore, our work highlights the potential of 3D Gaussians in real-time applications with dynamic lighting, offering insights into performance and optimization.

- **Summary**: Time becomes visible through illumination changes in what we see. Inspired by this, in this paper we explore the potential to learn time awareness from static images, trying to answer: what time tells us? To this end, we first introduce a Time-Oriented Collection (TOC) dataset, which contains 130,906 images with reliable timestamps. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a Time-Image Contrastive Learning (TICL) approach to jointly model timestamps and related visual representations through cross-modal contrastive learning. We found that the proposed TICL, 1) not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the timestamp estimation task, over various benchmark metrics, 2) but also, interestingly, though only seeing static images, the time-aware embeddings learned from TICL show strong capability in several time-aware downstream tasks such as time-based image retrieval, video scene classification, and time-aware image editing. Our findings suggest that time-related visual cues can be learned from static images and are beneficial for various vision tasks, laying a foundation for future research on understanding time-related visual context.

- **Summary**: Image compression technology eliminates redundant information to enable efficient transmission and storage of images, serving both machine vision and human visual perception. For years, image coding focused on human perception has been well-studied, leading to the development of various image compression standards. On the other hand, with the rapid advancements in image recognition models, image compression for AI tasks, known as Image Coding for Machines (ICM), has gained significant importance. Therefore, scalable image coding techniques that address the needs of both machines and humans have become a key area of interest. Additionally, there is increasing demand for research applying the diffusion model, which can generate human-viewable images from a small amount of data to image compression methods for human vision. Image compression methods that use diffusion models can partially reconstruct the target image by guiding the generation process with a small amount of conditioning information. Inspired by the diffusion model's potential, we propose a method for extending machine vision to human visual perception using guided diffusion. Utilizing the diffusion model guided by the output of the ICM method, we generate images for human perception from random noise. Guided diffusion acts as a bridge between machine vision and human vision, enabling transitions between them without any additional bitrate overhead. The generated images then evaluated based on bitrate and image quality, and we compare their compression performance with other scalable image coding methods for humans and machines.

- **Summary**: Consistency regularization has prevailed in semi-supervised semantic segmentation and achieved promising performance. However, existing methods typically concentrate on enhancing the Image-augmentation based Prediction consistency and optimizing the segmentation network as a whole, resulting in insufficient utilization of potential supervisory information. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Constraint Consistency Learning (MCCL) approach to facilitate the staged enhancement of the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we first design a feature knowledge alignment (FKA) strategy to promote the feature consistency learning of the encoder from image-augmentation. Our FKA encourages the encoder to derive consistent features for strongly and weakly augmented views from the perspectives of point-to-point alignment and prototype-based intra-class compactness. Moreover, we propose a self-adaptive intervention (SAI) module to increase the discrepancy of aligned intermediate feature representations, promoting Feature-perturbation based Prediction consistency learning. Self-adaptive feature masking and noise injection are designed in an instance-specific manner to perturb the features for robust learning of the decoder. Experimental results on Pascal VOC2012 and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that our proposed MCCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: All-in-one image restoration seeks to recover high-quality images from various types of degradation using a single model, without prior knowledge of the corruption source. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively and efficiently handle multiple degradation types. We present Cat-AIR, a novel \textbf{C}ontent \textbf{A}nd \textbf{T}ask-aware framework for \textbf{A}ll-in-one \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration. Cat-AIR incorporates an alternating spatial-channel attention mechanism that adaptively balances the local and global information for different tasks. Specifically, we introduce cross-layer channel attentions and cross-feature spatial attentions that allocate computations based on content and task complexity. Furthermore, we propose a smooth learning strategy that allows for seamless adaptation to new restoration tasks while maintaining performance on existing ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cat-AIR achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of restoration tasks, requiring fewer FLOPs than previous methods, establishing new benchmarks for efficient all-in-one image restoration.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models excel in various tasks, yet often struggle with modality bias, where the model tends to rely heavily on a single modality and overlook critical information in other modalities, which leads to incorrect focus and generating irrelevant responses. In this paper, we propose using the paradigm of preference optimization to solve the modality bias problem, including RLAIFVBias, a debiased preference optimization dataset, and a Noise Aware Preference Optimization algorithm. Specifically, we first construct the dataset by introducing perturbations to reduce the informational content of certain modalities, compelling the model to rely on a specific modality when generating negative responses. To address the inevitable noise in automatically constructed data, we combine the noise robust Mean Absolute Error with the Binary Cross Entropy in Direct Preference Optimization by a negative Box Cox transformation, and dynamically adjust the algorithm noise robustness based on the evaluated noise levels in the data. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating not only its effectiveness in mitigating modality bias but also its significant role in minimizing hallucinations.

- **Summary**: Text-to-video generative models have made remarkable advancements in recent years. However, generating RGBA videos with alpha channels for transparency and visual effects remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of suitable datasets and the complexity of adapting existing models for this purpose. To address these limitations, we present TransAnimate, an innovative framework that integrates RGBA image generation techniques with video generation modules, enabling the creation of dynamic and transparent videos. TransAnimate efficiently leverages pre-trained text-to-transparent image model weights and combines them with temporal models and controllability plugins trained on RGB videos, adapting them for controllable RGBA video generation tasks. Additionally, we introduce an interactive motion-guided control mechanism, where directional arrows define movement and colors adjust scaling, offering precise and intuitive control for designing game effects. To further alleviate data scarcity, we have developed a pipeline for creating an RGBA video dataset, incorporating high-quality game effect videos, extracted foreground objects, and synthetic transparent videos. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TransAnimate generates high-quality RGBA videos, establishing it as a practical and effective tool for applications in gaming and visual effects.

- **Summary**: Single underwater image enhancement (UIE) is a challenging ill-posed problem, but its development is hindered by two major issues: (1) The labels in underwater reference datasets are pseudo labels, relying on these pseudo ground truths in supervised learning leads to domain discrepancy. (2) Underwater reference datasets are scarce, making training on such small datasets prone to overfitting and distribution shift. To address these challenges, we propose Trans-UIE, a transfer learning-based UIE model that captures the fundamental paradigms of UIE through pretraining and utilizes a dataset composed of both reference and non-reference datasets for fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning the model using only reconstruction loss may introduce confirmation bias. To mitigate this, our method leverages no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metrics from above-water scenes to guide the transfer learning process across domains while generating enhanced images with the style of the above-water image domain. Additionally, to reduce the risk of overfitting during the pretraining stage, we introduce Pearson correlation loss. Experimental results on both full-reference and no-reference underwater benchmark datasets demonstrate that Trans-UIE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Two-view correspondence learning aims to discern true and false correspondences between image pairs by recognizing their underlying different information. Previous methods either treat the information equally or require the explicit storage of the entire context, tending to be laborious in real-world scenarios. Inspired by Mamba's inherent selectivity, we propose \textbf{CorrMamba}, a \textbf{Corr}espondence filter leveraging \textbf{Mamba}'s ability to selectively mine information from true correspondences while mitigating interference from false ones, thus achieving adaptive focus at a lower cost. To prevent Mamba from being potentially impacted by unordered keypoints that obscured its ability to mine spatial information, we customize a causal sequential learning approach based on the Gumbel-Softmax technique to establish causal dependencies between features in a fully autonomous and differentiable manner. Additionally, a local-context enhancement module is designed to capture critical contextual cues essential for correspondence pruning, complementing the core framework. Extensive experiments on relative pose estimation, visual localization, and analysis demonstrate that CorrMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, in outdoor relative pose estimation, our method surpasses the previous SOTA by $2.58$ absolute percentage points in AUC@20\textdegree, highlighting its practical superiority. Our code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) excel in generalization due to large-scale pretraining, but fine-tuning them for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) while maintaining this ability remains challenging. Existing approaches either selectively fine-tune parameters or freeze the VFMs and update only the adapters, both of which may underutilize the VFMs' full potential in DGSS tasks. We observe that domain-sensitive parameters in VFMs, arising from task and distribution differences, can hinder generalization. To address this, we propose \textbf{FisherTune}, a robust fine-tuning method guided by the Domain-Related Fisher Information Matrix (DR-FIM). DR-FIM measures parameter sensitivity across tasks and domains, enabling selective updates that preserve generalization and enhance DGSS adaptability. FisherTune incorporates variational inference to stabilize DR-FIM estimation, treating parameters as Gaussian-distributed variables and leveraging pre-trained priors. Extensive experiments show that FisherTune achieves superior cross-domain segmentation while maintaining generalization, outperforming selective-parameter and adapter-based methods.

- **Summary**: Remote Sensing Image Dehazing (RSID) poses significant challenges in real-world scenarios due to the complex atmospheric conditions and severe color distortions that degrade image quality. The scarcity of real-world remote sensing hazy image pairs has compelled existing methods to rely primarily on synthetic datasets. However, these methods struggle with real-world applications due to the inherent domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address this, we introduce Real-World Remote Sensing Hazy Image Dataset (RRSHID), the first large-scale dataset featuring real-world hazy and dehazed image pairs across diverse atmospheric conditions. Based on this, we propose MCAF-Net, a novel framework tailored for real-world RSID. Its effectiveness arises from three innovative components: Multi-branch Feature Integration Block Aggregator (MFIBA), which enables robust feature extraction through cascaded integration blocks and parallel multi-branch processing; Color-Calibrated Self-Supervised Attention Module (CSAM), which mitigates complex color distortions via self-supervised learning and attention-guided refinement; and Multi-Scale Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (MFAFM), which integrates features effectively while preserving local details and global context. Extensive experiments validate that MCAF-Net demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in real-world RSID, while maintaining competitive performance on synthetic datasets. The introduction of RRSHID and MCAF-Net sets new benchmarks for real-world RSID research, advancing practical solutions for this complex task. The code and dataset are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/lwCVer/RRSHID}.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer survival prediction in computational pathology presents a remarkable challenge due to tumor heterogeneity. For instance, different regions of the same tumor in the pathology image can show distinct morphological and molecular characteristics. This makes it difficult to extract representative features from whole slide images (WSIs) that truly reflect the tumor's aggressive potential and likely survival outcomes. In this paper, we present PathoHR, a novel pipeline for accurate breast cancer survival prediction that enhances any size of pathological images to enable more effective feature learning. Our approach entails (1) the incorporation of a plug-and-play high-resolution Vision Transformer (ViT) to enhance patch-wise WSI representation, enabling more detailed and comprehensive feature extraction, (2) the systematic evaluation of multiple advanced similarity metrics for comparing WSI-extracted features, optimizing the representation learning process to better capture tumor characteristics, (3) the demonstration that smaller image patches enhanced follow the proposed pipeline can achieve equivalent or superior prediction accuracy compared to raw larger patches, while significantly reducing computational overhead. Experimental findings valid that PathoHR provides the potential way of integrating enhanced image resolution with optimized feature learning to advance computational pathology, offering a promising direction for more accurate and efficient breast cancer survival prediction.

- **Summary**: Creating a physical digital twin of a real-world object has immense potential in robotics, content creation, and XR. In this paper, we present PhysTwin, a novel framework that uses sparse videos of dynamic objects under interaction to produce a photo- and physically realistic, real-time interactive virtual replica. Our approach centers on two key components: (1) a physics-informed representation that combines spring-mass models for realistic physical simulation, generative shape models for geometry, and Gaussian splats for rendering; and (2) a novel multi-stage, optimization-based inverse modeling framework that reconstructs complete geometry, infers dense physical properties, and replicates realistic appearance from videos. Our method integrates an inverse physics framework with visual perception cues, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction even from partial, occluded, and limited viewpoints. PhysTwin supports modeling various deformable objects, including ropes, stuffed animals, cloth, and delivery packages. Experiments show that PhysTwin outperforms competing methods in reconstruction, rendering, future prediction, and simulation under novel interactions. We further demonstrate its applications in interactive real-time simulation and model-based robotic motion planning.

- **Summary**: With the rising popularity of short video platforms, the demand for video production has increased substantially. However, high-quality video creation continues to rely heavily on professional editing skills and a nuanced understanding of visual language. To address this challenge, the Shot Sequence Ordering (SSO) task in AI-assisted video editing has emerged as a pivotal approach for enhancing video storytelling and the overall viewing experience. Nevertheless, the progress in this field has been impeded by a lack of publicly available benchmark datasets. In response, this paper introduces two novel benchmark datasets, AVE-Order and ActivityNet-Order. Additionally, we employ the Kendall Tau distance as an evaluation metric for the SSO task and propose the Kendall Tau Distance-Cross Entropy Loss. We further introduce the concept of Cinematology Embedding, which incorporates movie metadata and shot labels as prior knowledge into the SSO model, and constructs the AVE-Meta dataset to validate the method's effectiveness. Experimental results indicate that the proposed loss function and method substantially enhance SSO task accuracy. All datasets are publicly accessible at https://github.com/litchiar/ShotSeqBench.

- **Summary**: Human activity recognition (HAR) with deep learning models relies on large amounts of labeled data, often challenging to obtain due to associated cost, time, and labor. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an effective approach to leverage unlabeled data through pretext tasks, such as masked reconstruction and multitask learning with signal processing-based data augmentations, to pre-train encoder models. However, such methods are often derived from computer vision approaches that disregard physical mechanisms and constraints that govern wearable sensor data and the phenomena they reflect. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed multi-task pre-training (PIM) framework for IMU-based HAR. PIM generates pre-text tasks based on the understanding of basic physical aspects of human motion: including movement speed, angles of movement, and symmetry between sensor placements. Given a sensor signal, we calculate corresponding features using physics-based equations and use them as pretext tasks for SSL. This enables the model to capture fundamental physical characteristics of human activities, which is especially relevant for multi-sensor systems. Experimental evaluations on four HAR benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, including data augmentation and masked reconstruction, in terms of accuracy and F1 score. We have observed gains of almost 10\% in macro f1 score and accuracy with only 2 to 8 labeled examples per class and up to 3% when there is no reduction in the amount of training data.

- **Summary**: Understanding the geometric and semantic properties of the scene is crucial in autonomous navigation and particularly challenging in the case of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation. Such information may be by obtained by estimating depth and semantic segmentation maps of the surrounding environment and for their practical use in autonomous navigation, the procedure must be performed as close to real-time as possible. In this paper, we leverage monocular cameras on aerial robots to predict depth and semantic maps in low-altitude unstructured environments. We propose a joint deep-learning architecture that can perform the two tasks accurately and rapidly, and validate its effectiveness on MidAir and Aeroscapes benchmark datasets. Our joint-architecture proves to be competitive or superior to the other single and joint architecture methods while performing its task fast predicting 20.2 FPS on a single NVIDIA quadro p5000 GPU and it has a low memory footprint.

However, existing whole slide image (WSI) classification methods struggle to effectively incorporate histomorphology information, limiting their ability to capture key and fine-grained pathological features. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that explicitly incorporates histomorphology (tumor cellularity, cellular morphology, and tissue architecture) into WSI classification. Specifically, our approach consists of three key components: (1) estimating the importance of tumor-related histomorphology information at the patch level based on medical prior knowledge; (2) generating representative cluster-level features through histomorphology-driven cluster pooling; and (3) enabling WSI-level classification through histomorphology-driven multi-instance aggregation. With the incorporation of histomorphological information, our framework strengthens the model's ability to capture key and fine-grained pathological patterns, thereby enhancing WSI classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving high diagnostic accuracy for molecular subtyping and cancer subtyping. The code will be made available at https://github.com/Badgewho/HMDMIL.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised crowd counting is crucial for addressing the high annotation costs of densely populated scenes. Although several methods based on pseudo-labeling have been proposed, it remains challenging to effectively and accurately utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Taste More Taste Better (TMTB), which emphasizes both data and model aspects. Firstly, we explore a data augmentation technique well-suited for the crowd counting task. By inpainting the background regions, this technique can effectively enhance data diversity while preserving the fidelity of the entire scenes. Secondly, we introduce the Visual State Space Model as backbone to capture the global context information from crowd scenes, which is crucial for extremely crowded, low-light, and adverse weather scenarios. In addition to the traditional regression head for exact prediction, we employ an Anti-Noise classification head to provide less exact but more accurate supervision, since the regression head is sensitive to noise in manual annotations. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: To mitigate misuse, text-to-image~(T2I) models commonly incorporate safety filters to prevent the generation of sensitive images. Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods use LLMs to generate adversarial prompts that effectively bypass safety filters while generating sensitive images, revealing the safety vulnerabilities within the T2I model. However, existing LLM-based attack methods lack explicit guidance, relying on substantial queries to achieve a successful attack, which limits their practicality in real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce \textbf{MJA}, a \textbf{m}etaphor-based \textbf{j}ailbreaking \textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming to balance the attack effectiveness and query efficiency by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts. Specifically, MJA consists of two modules: an LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt optimization module~(APO). MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based adversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation. Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three LLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various metaphors and contexts. To enhance the attack efficiency, APO first trains a surrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then designs an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial prompts. Experiments demonstrate that MJA achieves better attack effectiveness while requiring fewer queries compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our adversarial prompts exhibit strong transferability across various open-source and commercial T2I models. \textcolor{red}{This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive or distressing material.}

- **Summary**: Normal reconstruction is crucial in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, as it provides key geometric and lighting information about hidden objects, which significantly improves reconstruction accuracy and scene understanding. However, jointly estimating normals and albedo expands the problem from matrix-valued functions to tensor-valued functions that substantially increasing complexity and computational difficulty. In this paper, we propose a novel joint albedo-surface reconstruction method, which utilizes the Frobenius norm of the shape operator to control the variation rate of the normal field. It is the first attempt to apply regularization methods to the reconstruction of surface normals for hidden objects. By improving the accuracy of the normal field, it enhances detail representation and achieves high-precision reconstruction of hidden object geometry. The proposed method demonstrates robustness and effectiveness on both synthetic and experimental datasets. On transient data captured within 15 seconds, our surface normal-regularized reconstruction model produces more accurate surfaces than recently proposed methods and is 30 times faster than the existing surface reconstruction approach.

- **Summary**: Point cloud completion aims to recover a complete point shape from a partial point cloud. Although existing methods can form satisfactory point clouds in global completeness, they often lose the original geometry details and face the problem of geometric inconsistency between existing point clouds and reconstructed missing parts. To tackle this problem, we introduce SymmCompletion, a highly effective completion method based on symmetry guidance. Our method comprises two primary components: a Local Symmetry Transformation Network (LSTNet) and a Symmetry-Guidance Transformer (SGFormer). First, LSTNet efficiently estimates point-wise local symmetry transformation to transform key geometries of partial inputs into missing regions, thereby generating geometry-align partial-missing pairs and initial point clouds. Second, SGFormer leverages the geometric features of partial-missing pairs as the explicit symmetric guidance that can constrain the refinement process for initial point clouds. As a result, SGFormer can exploit provided priors to form high-fidelity and geometry-consistency final point clouds. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art completion networks.

- **Summary**: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task that aims to simplify complex data by reducing its feature dimensionality while preserving essential patterns, with core applications in data analysis and visualisation. To preserve the underlying data structure, multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) methods focus on preserving pairwise dissimilarities, such as distances. They optimise the embedding to have pairwise distances as close as possible to the data dissimilarities. However, the current standard is limited to embedding data in Riemannian manifolds. Motivated by the lack of asymmetry in the Riemannian metric of the embedding space, this paper extends the MDS problem to a natural asymmetric generalisation of Riemannian manifolds called Finsler manifolds. Inspired by Euclidean space, we define a canonical Finsler space for embedding asymmetric data. Due to its simplicity with respect to geodesics, data representation in this space is both intuitive and simple to analyse. We demonstrate that our generalisation benefits from the same theoretical convergence guarantees. We reveal the effectiveness of our Finsler embedding across various types of non-symmetric data, highlighting its value in applications such as data visualisation, dimensionality reduction, directed graph embedding, and link prediction.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically follow a two-stage training paradigm-pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. Recently, preference optimization, derived from the language domain, has emerged as an effective post-training reinforcement strategy to enhance capabilities of LVLMs. However, constructing high-quality human-annotated preference data and developing robust reward models to mimic these preferences are both costly and challenging. Motivated by this observation, we propose Vision-R1, a novel vision-guided R1-like reinforcement learning algorithm for LVLMs that rewards models with definitive vision feedback. It only leverages curated instruction data, eliminating the need for specialized reward models and handcrafted preference datasets. We incorporate a criterion-driven reward function that further integrates multi-dimensional feedback to evaluate model completions comprehensively based on the vision task logic. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive rule refinement strategy that dynamically adjusts the reward criteria during training, enabling continuous model improvement and mitigating reward hacking. Extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the 7B LVLMs with Vision-R1 achieves consistent performance gains, with even up to 50% improvement and surpassing the state-of-the-art 10x size model.

- **Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal technique in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling access to external, reliable, and up-to-date knowledge sources. In the context of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), RAG has proven invaluable by augmenting model outputs with supplementary, relevant information, thus improving their quality. Recently, the potential of RAG has extended beyond natural language processing, with emerging methods integrating retrieval-augmented strategies into the computer vision (CV) domain. These approaches aim to address the limitations of relying solely on internal model knowledge by incorporating authoritative external knowledge bases, thereby improving both the understanding and generation capabilities of vision models. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV, focusing on two main areas: (I) visual understanding and (II) visual generation. In the realm of visual understanding, we systematically review tasks ranging from basic image recognition to complex applications such as medical report generation and multimodal question answering. For visual content generation, we examine the application of RAG in tasks related to image, video, and 3D generation. Furthermore, we explore recent advancements in RAG for embodied AI, with a particular focus on applications in planning, task execution, multimodal perception, interaction, and specialized domains. Given that the integration of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV is still in its early stages, we also highlight the key limitations of current approaches and propose future research directions to drive the development of this promising area.

- **Summary**: The rise of AI-driven generative models has enabled the creation of highly realistic speech deepfakes - synthetic audio signals that can imitate target speakers' voices - raising critical security concerns. Existing methods for detecting speech deepfakes primarily rely on supervised learning, which suffers from two critical limitations: limited generalization to unseen synthesis techniques and a lack of explainability. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing a novel interpretable one-class detection framework, which reframes speech deepfake detection as an anomaly detection task. Our model is trained exclusively on real speech to characterize its distribution, enabling the classification of out-of-distribution samples as synthetically generated. Additionally, our framework produces interpretable anomaly maps during inference, highlighting anomalous regions across both time and frequency domains. This is done through a Student-Teacher Feature Pyramid Matching system, enhanced with Discrepancy Scaling to improve generalization capabilities across unseen data distributions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to the considered baselines, validating the effectiveness of framing speech deepfake detection as an anomaly detection problem.

- **Summary**: Omnimatte aims to decompose a given video into semantically meaningful layers, including the background and individual objects along with their associated effects, such as shadows and reflections. Existing methods often require extensive training or costly self-supervised optimization. In this paper, we present OmnimatteZero, a training-free approach that leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained video diffusion models for omnimatte. It can remove objects from videos, extract individual object layers along with their effects, and composite those objects onto new videos. We accomplish this by adapting zero-shot image inpainting techniques for video object removal, a task they fail to handle effectively out-of-the-box. We then show that self-attention maps capture information about the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's effects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent arithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new video layers to produce new videos. Evaluations show that OmnimatteZero not only achieves superior performance in terms of background reconstruction but also sets a new record for the fastest Omnimatte approach, achieving real-time performance with minimal frame runtime.

- **Summary**: Does the prior knowledge of the vision encoder constrain the capability boundary of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs)? While most existing research treats MLLMs as unified systems optimized through end-to-end training, the impact of vision encoder's prior knowledge is seldom investigated. In this work, we introduce a novel metric, $Rank_e$, to quantify the effect of the vision encoder's prior knowledge on MLLM performance. Our analysis reveals a positive correlation between prior knowledge and MLLM performance. Moreover, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning using solely end-to-end visual question answering (VQA) data is insufficient--particularly for entities with low inherent visual prior knowledge. To address this issue, we propose VisPRE (Vision Prior Remediation), a two-stage training framework that explicitly incorporates prior knowledge at the vision encoder level. Experimental results demonstrate that augmenting vision encoder's prior knowledge substantially boosts the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs, offering a novel and effective strategy for improving performance, especially in scenarios involving uncommon visual entities.

- **Summary**: Environment description-based localization in large-scale point cloud maps constructed through remote sensing is critically significant for the advancement of large-scale autonomous systems, such as delivery robots operating in the last mile. However, current approaches encounter challenges due to the inability of point cloud encoders to effectively capture local details and long-range spatial relationships, as well as a significant modality gap between text and point cloud representations. To address these challenges, we present Des4Pos, a novel two-stage text-driven remote sensing localization framework. In the coarse stage, the point-cloud encoder utilizes the Multi-scale Fusion Attention Mechanism (MFAM) to enhance local geometric features, followed by a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to strengthen global spatial relationships. Concurrently, the Stepped Text Encoder (STE) integrates cross-modal prior knowledge from CLIP [1] and aligns text and point-cloud features using this prior knowledge, effectively bridging modality discrepancies. In the fine stage, we introduce a Cascaded Residual Attention (CRA) module to fuse cross-modal features and predict relative localization offsets, thereby achieving greater localization precision. Experiments on the KITTI360Pose test set demonstrate that Des4Pos achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-point-cloud place recognition. Specifically, it attains a top-1 accuracy of 40% and a top-10 accuracy of 77% under a 5-meter radius threshold, surpassing the best existing methods by 7% and 7%, respectively.

- **Summary**: We propose an autofocusing algorithm to obtain, relatively accurately, the 3D position of each particle, particularly its axial location, and particle number of a dense transparent particle solution via its hologram. First, morphological analyses and constrained intensity are used on raw reconstructed images to obtain information on candidate focused particles. Second, axial resolution is used to obtain the real focused particles. Based on the mean intensity and equivalent diameter of each candidate focused particle, all focused particles are eventually secured. Our proposed method can rapidly provide relatively accurate ground-truth axial positions to solve the autofocusing problem that occurs with dense particles.

- **Summary**: Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) enables vision models to adapt to changing conditions in real-world environments while maintaining the knowledge acquired from previous domains. Given privacy concerns and training time, Rehearsal-Free DIL (RFDIL) is more practical. Inspired by the incremental cognitive process of the human brain, we design Dual-level Concept Prototypes (DualCP) for each class to address the conflict between learning new knowledge and retaining old knowledge in RFDIL. To construct DualCP, we propose a Concept Prototype Generator (CPG) that generates both coarse-grained and fine-grained prototypes for each class. Additionally, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine calibrator (C2F) to align image features with DualCP. Finally, we propose a Dual Dot-Regression (DDR) loss function to optimize our C2F module. Extensive experiments on the DomainNet, CDDB, and CORe50 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Recognizing arbitrary or previously unseen categories is essential for comprehensive real-world 3D scene understanding. Currently, all existing methods rely on 2D or textual modalities during training, or together at inference. This highlights a clear absence of a model capable of processing 3D data alone for learning semantics end-to-end, along with the necessary data to train such a model. Meanwhile, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the de facto standard for 3D scene representation across various vision tasks. However, effectively integrating semantic reasoning into 3DGS in a generalizable fashion remains an open challenge. To address these limitations we introduce SceneSplat, to our knowledge the first large-scale 3D indoor scene understanding approach that operates natively on 3DGS. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised learning scheme that unlocks rich 3D feature learning from unlabeled scenes. In order to power the proposed methods, we introduce SceneSplat-7K, the first large-scale 3DGS dataset for indoor scenes, comprising of 6868 scenes derived from 7 established datasets like ScanNet, Matterport3D, etc. Generating SceneSplat-7K required computational resources equivalent to 119 GPU-days on an L4 GPU, enabling standardized benchmarking for 3DGS-based reasoning for indoor scenes. Our exhaustive experiments on SceneSplat-7K demonstrate the significant benefit of the proposed methods over the established baselines.

- **Summary**: Reflection removal is challenging due to complex light interactions, where reflections obscure important details and hinder scene understanding. Polarization naturally provides a powerful cue to distinguish between reflected and transmitted light, enabling more accurate reflection removal. However, existing methods often rely on small-scale or synthetic datasets, which fail to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world scenarios. To this end, we construct a large-scale dataset, PolaRGB, for Polarization-based reflection removal of RGB images, which enables us to train models that generalize effectively across a wide range of real-world scenarios. The PolaRGB dataset contains 6,500 well-aligned mixed-transmission image pairs, 8x larger than existing polarization datasets, and is the first to include both RGB and polarization images captured across diverse indoor and outdoor environments with varying lighting conditions. Besides, to fully exploit the potential of polarization cues for reflection removal, we introduce PolarFree, which leverages diffusion process to generate reflection-free cues for accurate reflection removal. Extensive experiments show that PolarFree significantly enhances image clarity in challenging reflective scenarios, setting a new benchmark for polarized imaging and reflection removal. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/mdyao/PolarFree.

- **Summary**: Federated continual learning (FCL) offers an emerging pattern to facilitate the applicability of federated learning (FL) in real-world scenarios, where tasks evolve dynamically and asynchronously across clients, especially in medical scenario. Existing server-side FCL methods in nature domain construct a continually learnable server model by client aggregation on all-involved tasks. However, they are challenged by: (1) Catastrophic forgetting for previously learned tasks, leading to error accumulation in server model, making it difficult to sustain comprehensive knowledge across all tasks. (2) Biased optimization due to asynchronous tasks handled across different clients, leading to the collision of optimization targets of different clients at the same time steps. In this work, we take the first step to propose a novel server-side FCL pattern in medical domain, Dynamic Allocation Hypernetwork with adaptive model recalibration (\textbf{FedDAH}). It is to facilitate collaborative learning under the distinct and dynamic task streams across clients. To alleviate the catastrophic forgetting, we propose a dynamic allocation hypernetwork (DAHyper) where a continually updated hypernetwork is designed to manage the mapping between task identities and their associated model parameters, enabling the dynamic allocation of the model across clients. For the biased optimization, we introduce a novel adaptive model recalibration (AMR) to incorporate the candidate changes of historical models into current server updates, and assign weights to identical tasks across different time steps based on the similarity for continual optimization. Extensive experiments on the AMOS dataset demonstrate the superiority of our FedDAH to other FCL methods on sites with different task streams.

- **Summary**: Data scarcity is a long-standing challenge in the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) field, which extremely hinders the generalization of agents to unseen environments. Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction is a challenging task for simultaneous scene reconstruction and understanding. Recently, methods have been proposed for 3D scene understanding based on Gaussian splatting. However, these methods are multi-staged, suffering from the accumulated errors and the dependence of hand-designed components. To streamline the pipeline and achieve global optimization, we propose PanopticSplatting, an end-to-end system for open-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction. Our method introduces query-guided Gaussian segmentation with local cross attention, lifting 2D instance masks without cross-frame association in an end-to-end way. The local cross attention within view frustum effectively reduces the training memory, making our model more accessible to large scenes with more Gaussians and objects. In addition, to address the challenge of noisy labels in 2D pseudo masks, we propose label blending to promote consistent 3D segmentation with less noisy floaters, as well as label warping on 2D predictions which enhances multi-view coherence and segmentation accuracy. Our method demonstrates strong performances in 3D scene panoptic reconstruction on the ScanNet-V2 and ScanNet++ datasets, compared with both NeRF-based and Gaussian-based panoptic reconstruction methods. Moreover, PanopticSplatting can be easily generalized to numerous variants of Gaussian splatting, and we demonstrate its robustness on different Gaussian base models.

- **Summary**: Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) have revolutionized medical analysis by presenting high-resolution images of the whole tissue slide. Despite avoiding the physical storage of the slides, WSIs require considerable data volume, which makes the storage and maintenance of WSI records costly and unsustainable. To this end, this work presents the first investigation of lossless compression of WSI images. Interestingly, we find that most existing compression methods fail to compress the WSI images effectively. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the failure of existing compressors is mainly due to information irregularity in WSI images. To resolve this issue, we developed a simple yet effective lossless compressor called WISE, specifically designed for WSI images. WISE employs a hierarchical encoding strategy to extract effective bits, reducing the entropy of the image and then adopting a dictionary-based method to handle the irregular frequency patterns. Through extensive experiments, we show that WISE can effectively compress the gigapixel WSI images to 36 times on average and up to 136 times.

- **Summary**: In the emerging field of urban digital twins (UDTs), advancing intelligent road inspection (IRI) vehicles with automatic road crack detection systems is essential for maintaining civil infrastructure. Over the past decade, deep learning-based road crack detection methods have been developed to detect cracks more efficiently, accurately, and objectively, with the goal of replacing manual visual inspection. Nonetheless, there is a lack of systematic reviews on state-of-the-art (SoTA) deep learning techniques, especially data-fusion and label-efficient algorithms for this task. This paper thoroughly reviews the SoTA deep learning-based algorithms, including (1) supervised, (2) unsupervised, (3) semi-supervised, and (4) weakly-supervised methods developed for road crack detection. Also, we create a dataset called UDTIRI-Crack, comprising $2,500$ high-quality images from seven public annotated sources, as the first extensive online benchmark in this field. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to compare the detection performance, computational efficiency, and generalizability of public SoTA deep learning-based algorithms for road crack detection. In addition, the feasibility of foundation models and large language models (LLMs) for road crack detection is explored. Afterwards, the existing challenges and future development trends of deep learning-based road crack detection algorithms are discussed. We believe this review can serve as practical guidance for developing intelligent road detection vehicles with the next-generation road condition assessment systems. The released benchmark UDTIRI-Crack is available at https://udtiri.com/submission/.

- **Summary**: With the growth of 3D applications and the rapid increase in sensor-collected 3D point cloud data, there is a rising demand for efficient compression algorithms. Most existing learning-based compression methods handle geometry and color attributes separately, treating them as distinct tasks, making these methods challenging to apply directly to point clouds with colors. Besides, the limited capacities of training datasets also limit their generalizability across points with different distributions. In this work, we introduce a test-time unified geometry and color compression framework of 3D point clouds. Instead of training a compression model based on specific datasets, we adapt a pre-trained generative diffusion model to compress original colored point clouds into sparse sets, termed 'seeds', using prompt tuning. Decompression is then achieved through multiple denoising steps with separate sampling processes. Experiments on objects and indoor scenes demonstrate that our method has superior performances compared to existing baselines for the compression of geometry and color.

- **Summary**: Open Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection (OVVAD) seeks to detect and classify both base and novel anomalies. However, existing methods face two specific challenges related to novel anomalies. The first challenge is detection ambiguity, where the model struggles to assign accurate anomaly scores to unfamiliar anomalies. The second challenge is categorization confusion, where novel anomalies are often misclassified as visually similar base instances. To address these challenges, we explore supplementary information from multiple sources to mitigate detection ambiguity by leveraging multiple levels of visual data alongside matching textual information. Furthermore, we propose incorporating label relations to guide the encoding of new labels, thereby improving alignment between novel videos and their corresponding labels, which helps reduce categorization confusion. The resulting Anomize framework effectively tackles these issues, achieving superior performance on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in OVVAD.

- **Summary**: The perception system for autonomous driving generally requires to handle multiple diverse sub-tasks. However, current algorithms typically tackle individual sub-tasks separately, which leads to low efficiency when aiming at obtaining full-perception results. Some multi-task learning methods try to unify multiple tasks with one model, but do not solve the conflicts in multi-task learning. In this paper, we introduce M3Net, a novel multimodal and multi-task network that simultaneously tackles detection, segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous driving and achieves superior performance than single task model. M3Net takes multimodal data as input and multiple tasks via query-token interactions. To enhance the integration of multi-modal features for multi-task learning, we first propose the Modality-Adaptive Feature Integration (MAFI) module, which enables single-modality features to predict channel-wise attention weights for their high-performing tasks, respectively. Based on integrated features, we then develop task-specific query initialization strategies to accommodate the needs of detection/segmentation and 3D occupancy prediction. Leveraging the properly initialized queries, a shared decoder transforms queries and BEV features layer-wise, facilitating multi-task learning. Furthermore, we propose a Task-oriented Channel Scaling (TCS) module in the decoder to mitigate conflicts between optimizing for different tasks. Additionally, our proposed multi-task querying and TCS module support both Transformer-based decoder and Mamba-based decoder, demonstrating its flexibility to different architectures. M3Net achieves state-of-the-art multi-task learning performance on the nuScenes benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown encouraging performance for open vocabulary scene understanding tasks. However, previous methods cannot distinguish 3D instance-level information, which usually predicts a heatmap between the scene feature and text query. In this paper, we propose PanoGS, a novel and effective 3D panoptic open vocabulary scene understanding approach. Technically, to learn accurate 3D language features that can scale to large indoor scenarios, we adopt the pyramid tri-plane to model the latent continuous parametric feature space and use a 3D feature decoder to regress the multi-view fused 2D feature cloud. Besides, we propose language-guided graph cuts that synergistically leverage reconstructed geometry and learned language cues to group 3D Gaussian primitives into a set of super-primitives. To obtain 3D consistent instance, we perform graph clustering based segmentation with SAM-guided edge affinity computation between different super-primitives. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets show better or more competitive performance on 3D panoptic open vocabulary scene understanding.

- **Summary**: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving (AD) models require diverse, high-quality data to perform well across various driving scenarios. However, collecting large-scale real-world data is expensive and time-consuming, making high-fidelity synthetic data essential for enhancing data diversity and model robustness. Existing driving simulators for synthetic data generation have significant limitations: game-engine-based simulators struggle to produce realistic sensor data, while NeRF-based and diffusion-based methods face efficiency challenges. Additionally, recent simulators designed for closed-loop evaluation provide limited interaction with other vehicles, failing to simulate complex real-world traffic dynamics. To address these issues, we introduce SceneCrafter, a realistic, interactive, and efficient AD simulator based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). SceneCrafter not only efficiently generates realistic driving logs across diverse traffic scenarios but also enables robust closed-loop evaluation of end-to-end models. Experimental results demonstrate that SceneCrafter serves as both a reliable evaluation platform and a efficient data generator that significantly improves end-to-end model generalization.

- **Summary**: Implicit neural representations (INRs) such as NeRF and SIREN encode a signal in neural network parameters and show excellent results for signal reconstruction. Using INRs for downstream tasks, such as classification, is however not straightforward. Inherent symmetries in the parameters pose challenges and current works primarily focus on designing architectures that are equivariant to these symmetries. However, INR-based classification still significantly under-performs compared to pixel-based methods like CNNs. This work presents an end-to-end strategy for initializing SIRENs together with a learned learning-rate scheme, to yield representations that improve classification accuracy. We show that a simple, straightforward, Transformer model applied to a meta-learned SIREN, without incorporating explicit symmetry equivariances, outperforms the current state-of-the-art. On the CIFAR-10 SIREN classification task, we improve the state-of-the-art without augmentations from 38.8% to 59.6%, and from 63.4% to 64.7% with augmentations. We demonstrate scalability on the high-resolution Imagenette dataset achieving reasonable reconstruction quality with a classification accuracy of 60.8% and are the first to do INR classification on the full ImageNet-1K dataset where we achieve a SIREN classification performance of 23.6%. To the best of our knowledge, no other SIREN classification approach has managed to set a classification baseline for any high-resolution image dataset.

- **Summary**: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection often faces high levels of ambiguity and indeterminacy, as the same interaction can appear vastly different across different human-object pairs. Additionally, the indeterminacy can be further exacerbated by issues such as occlusions and cluttered backgrounds. To handle such a challenging task, in this work, we begin with a key observation: the output of HOI detection for each human-object pair can be recast as an image. Thus, inspired by the strong image generation capabilities of image diffusion models, we propose a new framework, HOI-IDiff. In HOI-IDiff, we tackle HOI detection from a novel perspective, using an Image-like Diffusion process to generate HOI detection outputs as images. Furthermore, recognizing that our recast images differ in certain properties from natural images, we enhance our framework with a customized HOI diffusion process and a slice patchification model architecture, which are specifically tailored to generate our recast ``HOI images''. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our framework.

- **Summary**: Reasoning segmentation aims to segment target objects in complex scenes based on human intent and spatial reasoning. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive 2D image reasoning segmentation, adapting these capabilities to 3D scenes remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-For3D, a simple yet effective framework that transfers knowledge from 2D MLLMs to 3D scene understanding. Specifically, we utilize MLLMs to generate multi-view pseudo segmentation masks and corresponding text embeddings, then unproject 2D masks into 3D space and align them with the text embeddings. The primary challenge lies in the absence of 3D context and spatial consistency across multiple views, causing the model to hallucinate objects that do not exist and fail to target objects consistently. Training the 3D model with such irrelevant objects leads to performance degradation. To address this, we introduce a spatial consistency strategy to enforce that segmentation masks remain coherent in the 3D space, effectively capturing the geometry of the scene. Moreover, we develop a Token-for-Query approach for multimodal semantic alignment, enabling consistent identification of the same object across different views. Extensive evaluations on various challenging indoor scene benchmarks demonstrate that, even without any labeled 3D training data, MLLM-For3D outperforms existing 3D reasoning segmentation methods, effectively interpreting user intent, understanding 3D scenes, and reasoning about spatial relationships.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image synthesis, largely attributed to the use of classifier-free guidance (CFG), which enables high-quality, condition-aligned image generation. CFG combines the conditional score (e.g., text-conditioned) with the unconditional score to control the output. However, the unconditional score is in charge of estimating the transition between manifolds of adjacent timesteps from $x_t$ to $x_{t-1}$, which may inadvertently interfere with the trajectory toward the specific condition. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a geometric perspective on the unconditional score to enhance CFG performance when conditional scores are available. Specifically, we propose a method that filters the singular vectors of both conditional and unconditional scores using singular value decomposition. This filtering process aligns the unconditional score with the conditional score, thereby refining the sampling trajectory to stay closer to the manifold. Our approach improves image quality with negligible additional computation. We provide deeper insights into the score function behavior in diffusion models and present a practical technique for achieving more accurate and contextually coherent image synthesis.

- **Summary**: Assessing gait impairment plays an important role in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and treatment evaluation for neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its widespread use in clinical practice, it is limited by subjectivity and a lack of precision. While recent deep learning-based approaches have consistently improved classification accuracies, they often lack interpretability, hindering their utility in clinical decision-making. To overcome these challenges, we introduce AGIR, a novel pipeline consisting of a pre-trained VQ-VAE motion tokenizer and a subsequent Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned over pairs of motion tokens and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasonings. To fine-tune an LLM for pathological gait analysis, we first introduce a multimodal dataset by adding rationales dedicated to MDS-UPDRS gait score assessment to an existing PD gait dataset. We then introduce a two-stage supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy to enhance the LLM's motion comprehension with pathology-specific knowledge. This strategy includes: 1) a generative stage that aligns gait motions with analytic descriptions through bidirectional motion-description generation, 2) a reasoning stage that integrates logical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for impairment assessment with UPDRS gait score. Validation on an existing dataset and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods confirm the robustness and accuracy of our pipeline, demonstrating its ability to assign gait impairment scores from motion input with clinically meaningful rationales.

- **Summary**: Image geolocalization is a fundamental yet challenging task, aiming at inferring the geolocation on Earth where an image is taken. Existing methods approach it either via grid-based classification or via image retrieval. Their performance significantly suffers when the spatial distribution of test images does not align with such choices. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage diffusion as a mechanism for image geolocalization. To avoid the problematic manifold reprojection step in diffusion, we developed a novel spherical positional encoding-decoding framework, which encodes points on a spherical surface (e.g., geolocations on Earth) into a Hilbert space of Spherical Harmonics coefficients and decodes points (geolocations) by mode-seeking. We call this type of position encoding Spherical Harmonics Dirac Delta (SHDD) Representation. We also propose a novel SirenNet-based architecture called CS-UNet to learn the conditional backward process in the latent SHDD space by minimizing a latent KL-divergence loss. We train a conditional latent diffusion model called LocDiffusion that generates geolocations under the guidance of images -- to the best of our knowledge, the first generative model for image geolocalization by diffusing geolocation information in a hidden location embedding space. We evaluate our method against SOTA image geolocalization baselines. LocDiffusion achieves competitive geolocalization performance and demonstrates significantly stronger generalizability to unseen geolocations.

- **Summary**: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing, yet 2D Parametric Primitive Analysis (PPA) remains underexplored due to two key challenges: structural constraint reasoning and advanced semantic understanding. To tackle these challenges, we first propose an Efficient Hybrid Parametrization (EHP) for better representing 2D engineering drawings. EHP contains four types of atomic component i.e., point, line, circle, and arc). Additionally, we propose PHT-CAD, a novel 2D PPA framework that harnesses the modality alignment and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for precise engineering drawing analysis. In PHT-CAD, we introduce four dedicated regression heads to predict corresponding atomic components. To train PHT-CAD, a three-stage training paradigm Progressive Hierarchical Tuning (PHT) is proposed to progressively enhance PHT-CAD's capability to perceive individual primitives, infer structural constraints, and align annotation layers with their corresponding geometric representations. Considering that existing datasets lack complete annotation layers and real-world engineering drawings, we introduce ParaCAD, the first large-scale benchmark that explicitly integrates both the geometric and annotation layers. ParaCAD comprises over 10 million annotated drawings for training and 3,000 real-world industrial drawings with complex topological structures and physical constraints for test. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PHT-CAD and highlight the practical significance of ParaCAD in advancing 2D PPA research.

Despite their encouraging performance, most of these models are mainly designed and trained for short video generation, leading to challenges in maintaining temporal consistency and visual details in long video generation. In this paper, we propose LongDiff, a novel training-free method consisting of carefully designed components \ -- Position Mapping (PM) and Informative Frame Selection (IFS) \ -- to tackle two key challenges that hinder short-to-long video generation generalization: temporal position ambiguity and information dilution. Our LongDiff unlocks the potential of off-the-shelf video diffusion models to achieve high-quality long video generation in one go. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has emerged as the predominant solution for classifying medical images. We intend to apply these developments to the ultra-widefield (UWF) retinal imaging dataset. Since UWF images can accurately diagnose various retina diseases, it is very important to clas sify them accurately and prevent them with early treatment. However, processing images manually is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and there are two challenges to automating this process. First, high perfor mance usually requires high computational resources. Artificial intelli gence medical technology is better suited for places with limited medical resources, but using high-performance processing units in such environ ments is challenging. Second, the problem of the accuracy of colour fun dus photography (CFP) methods. In general, the UWF method provides more information for retinal diagnosis than the CFP method, but most of the research has been conducted based on the CFP method. Thus, we demonstrate that these problems can be efficiently addressed in low performance units using methods such as strategic data augmentation and model ensembles, which balance performance and computational re sources while utilizing UWF images.

- **Summary**: 3D indoor scene generation is an important problem for the design of digital and real-world environments. To automate this process, a scene generation model should be able to not only generate plausible scene layouts, but also take into consideration visual features and style preferences. Existing methods for this task exhibit very limited control over these attributes, only allowing text inputs in the form of simple object-level descriptions or pairwise spatial relationships. Our proposed method Decorum enables users to control the scene generation process with natural language by adopting language-based representations at each stage. This enables us to harness recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) to model language-to-language mappings. In addition, we show that using a text-based representation allows us to select furniture for our scenes using a novel object retrieval method based on multimodal LLMs. Evaluations on the benchmark 3D-FRONT dataset show that our methods achieve improvements over existing work in text-conditioned scene synthesis and object retrieval.

- **Summary**: Real-time speech-driven 3D facial animation has been attractive in academia and industry. Traditional methods mainly focus on learning a deterministic mapping from speech to animation. Recent approaches start to consider the nondeterministic fact of speech-driven 3D face animation and employ the diffusion model for the task. Existing diffusion-based methods can improve the diversity of facial animation. However, personalized speaking styles conveying accurate lip language is still lacking, besides, efficiency and compactness still need to be improved. In this work, we propose DiffusionTalker to address the above limitations via personalizer-guided distillation. In terms of personalization, we introduce a contrastive personalizer that learns identity and emotion embeddings to capture speaking styles from audio. We further propose a personalizer enhancer during distillation to enhance the influence of embeddings on facial animation. For efficiency, we use iterative distillation to reduce the steps required for animation generation and achieve more than 8x speedup in inference. To achieve compactness, we distill the large teacher model into a smaller student model, reducing our model's storage by 86.4\% while minimizing performance loss. After distillation, users can derive their identity and emotion embeddings from audio to quickly create personalized animations that reflect specific speaking styles. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released at: https://github.com/ChenVoid/DiffusionTalker.

- **Summary**: Though CLIP-based prompt tuning significantly enhances pre-trained Vision-Language Models, existing research focuses on reconstructing the model architecture, e.g., additional loss calculation and meta-networks. These approaches generally lead to increased complexity and extended training cost. To maintain the efficiency of the tuning process, we propose plug-and-play Model-Agnostic Optimization (MAO) for prompt tuning. Without altering any components of the prompt tuning backbone, we introduce a Data-Driven Enhancement framework to optimize the distribution of the initial data, and incorporate an Alterable Regularization module to boost the task-specific feature processing pipeline, thereby improving overall performance while maintaining low computational cost. Extensive experiments on MAO demonstrate its outstanding performance and efficiency. The code of MAO is available at: https://github.com/JREion/M.A.O .

- **Summary**: To develop and evaluate a new deep learning MR denoising method that leverages quantitative noise distribution information from the reconstruction process to improve denoising performance and generalization.   This retrospective study trained 14 different transformer and convolutional models with two backbone architectures on a large dataset of 2,885,236 images from 96,605 cardiac retro-gated cine complex series acquired at 3T. The proposed training scheme, termed SNRAware, leverages knowledge of the MRI reconstruction process to improve denoising performance by simulating large, high quality, and diverse synthetic datasets, and providing quantitative information about the noise distribution to the model. In-distribution testing was performed on a hold-out dataset of 3000 samples with performance measured using PSNR and SSIM, with ablation comparison without the noise augmentation. Out-of-distribution tests were conducted on cardiac real-time cine, first-pass cardiac perfusion, and neuro and spine MRI, all acquired at 1.5T, to test model generalization across imaging sequences, dynamically changing contrast, different anatomies, and field strengths. The best model found in the in-distribution test generalized well to out-of-distribution samples, delivering 6.5x and 2.9x CNR improvement for real-time cine and perfusion imaging, respectively. Further, a model trained with 100% cardiac cine data generalized well to a T1 MPRAGE neuro 3D scan and T2 TSE spine MRI.

- **Summary**: Producing high-quality segmentation masks for medical images is a fundamental challenge in biomedical image analysis. Recent research has explored large-scale supervised training to enable segmentation across various medical imaging modalities and unsupervised training to facilitate segmentation without dense annotations. However, constructing a model capable of segmenting diverse medical images in a zero-shot manner without any annotations remains a significant hurdle. This paper introduces the Attention Diffusion Zero-shot Unsupervised System (ADZUS), a novel approach that leverages self-attention diffusion models for zero-shot biomedical image segmentation. ADZUS harnesses the intrinsic capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models, utilizing their generative and discriminative potentials to segment medical images without requiring annotated training data or prior domain-specific knowledge. The ADZUS architecture is detailed, with its integration of self-attention mechanisms that facilitate context-aware and detail-sensitive segmentations being highlighted. Experimental results across various medical imaging datasets, including skin lesion segmentation, chest X-ray infection segmentation, and white blood cell segmentation, reveal that ADZUS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, ADZUS reached Dice scores ranging from 88.7\% to 92.9\% and IoU scores from 66.3\% to 93.3\% across different segmentation tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in handling novel, unseen medical imagery. It is noteworthy that while ADZUS demonstrates high effectiveness, it demands substantial computational resources and extended processing times. The model's efficacy in zero-shot settings underscores its potential to reduce reliance on costly annotations and seamlessly adapt to new medical imaging tasks, thereby expanding the diagnostic capabilities of AI-driven medical imaging technologies.

- **Summary**: The increasing number of autonomous vehicles and the rapid development of computer vision technologies underscore the particular importance of conducting research on the accuracy of traffic sign recognition. Numerous studies in this field have already achieved significant results, demonstrating high effectiveness in addressing traffic sign recognition tasks. However, the task becomes considerably more complex when a sign is partially obscured by surrounding objects, such as tree branches, billboards, or other elements of the urban environment. In our study, we investigated how partial occlusion of traffic signs affects their recognition. For this purpose, we collected a dataset comprising 5,746 images, including both fully visible and partially occluded signs, and made it publicly available. Using this dataset, we compared the performance of our custom convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieved 96% accuracy, with models trained using transfer learning. The best result was obtained by VGG16 with full layer unfreezing, reaching 99% accuracy. Additional experiments revealed that models trained solely on fully visible signs lose effectiveness when recognizing occluded signs. This highlights the critical importance of incorporating real-world data with partial occlusion into training sets to ensure robust model performance in complex practical scenarios and to enhance the safety of autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Text-based 3D human motion editing is a critical yet challenging task in computer vision and graphics. While training-free approaches have been explored, the recent release of the MotionFix dataset, which includes source-text-motion triplets, has opened new avenues for training, yielding promising results. However, existing methods struggle with precise control, often leading to misalignment between motion semantics and language instructions. In this paper, we introduce a related task, motion similarity prediction, and propose a multi-task training paradigm, where we train the model jointly on motion editing and motion similarity prediction to foster the learning of semantically meaningful representations. To complement this task, we design an advanced Diffusion-Transformer-based architecture that separately handles motion similarity prediction and motion editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach in both editing alignment and fidelity.

- **Summary**: Monitoring wildlife is essential for ecology and ethology, especially in light of the increasing human impact on ecosystems. Camera traps have emerged as habitat-centric sensors enabling the study of wildlife populations at scale with minimal disturbance. However, the lack of annotated video datasets limits the development of powerful video understanding models needed to process the vast amount of fieldwork data collected. To advance research in wild animal behavior monitoring we present MammAlps, a multimodal and multi-view dataset of wildlife behavior monitoring from 9 camera-traps in the Swiss National Park. MammAlps contains over 14 hours of video with audio, 2D segmentation maps and 8.5 hours of individual tracks densely labeled for species and behavior. Based on 6135 single animal clips, we propose the first hierarchical and multimodal animal behavior recognition benchmark using audio, video and reference scene segmentation maps as inputs. Furthermore, we also propose a second ecology-oriented benchmark aiming at identifying activities, species, number of individuals and meteorological conditions from 397 multi-view and long-term ecological events, including false positive triggers. We advocate that both tasks are complementary and contribute to bridging the gap between machine learning and ecology. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/eceo-epfl/MammAlps

- **Summary**: Parameter-Efficient FineTuning (PEFT) methods have recently gained significant popularity thanks to the widespread availability of large-scale pretrained models. These methods allow for quick adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal computational cost. However, popular finetuning methods such as LoRA exhibit limited robustness when it comes to hyperparameter choices or extended training regimes, preventing optimal out-of-the-box performance. In contrast, bounded approaches, such as ETHER, provide greater robustness but are limited to extremely low-rank adaptations and fixed-strength transformations, reducing their adaptation expressive power. In this work, we propose Decoupled Low-rank Adaptation (DeLoRA), a novel finetuning method that normalizes and scales learnable low-rank matrices. By bounding the distance of the transformation, DeLoRA effectively decouples the angular learning from the adaptation strength, enhancing robustness without compromising performance. Through evaluations on subject-driven image generation, natural language understanding, and instruction tuning, we show that DeLoRA matches or surpasses performance of competing PEFT methods, while exhibiting stronger robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/DeLoRA.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates powerful zero-shot capabilities; however, its accuracy and robustness significantly decrease when applied to medical image segmentation. Existing methods address this issue through modality fusion, integrating textual and image information to provide more detailed priors. In this study, we argue that the granularity of text and the domain gap affect the accuracy of the priors. Furthermore, the discrepancy between high-level abstract semantics and pixel-level boundary details in images can introduce noise into the fusion process. To address this, we propose Prior-Guided SAM (PG-SAM), which employs a fine-grained modality prior aligner to leverage specialized medical knowledge for better modality alignment. The core of our method lies in efficiently addressing the domain gap with fine-grained text from a medical LLM. Meanwhile, it also enhances the priors' quality after modality alignment, ensuring more accurate segmentation. In addition, our decoder enhances the model's expressive capabilities through multi-level feature fusion and iterative mask optimizer operations, supporting unprompted learning. We also propose a unified pipeline that effectively supplies high-quality semantic information to SAM. Extensive experiments on the Synapse dataset demonstrate that the proposed PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our anonymous code is released at https://github.com/logan-0623/PG-SAM.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel knowledge distillation approach, CustomKD, that effectively leverages large vision foundation models (LVFMs) to enhance the performance of edge models (e.g., MobileNetV3). Despite recent advancements in LVFMs, such as DINOv2 and CLIP, their potential in knowledge distillation for enhancing edge models remains underexplored. While knowledge distillation is a promising approach for improving the performance of edge models, the discrepancy in model capacities and heterogeneous architectures between LVFMs and edge models poses a significant challenge. Our observation indicates that although utilizing larger backbones (e.g., ViT-S to ViT-L) in teacher models improves their downstream task performances, the knowledge distillation from the large teacher models fails to bring as much performance gain for student models as for teacher models due to the large model discrepancy. Our simple yet effective CustomKD customizes the well-generalized features inherent in LVFMs to a given student model in order to reduce model discrepancies. Specifically, beyond providing well-generalized original knowledge from teachers, CustomKD aligns the features of teachers to those of students, making it easy for students to understand and overcome the large model discrepancy overall. CustomKD significantly improves the performances of edge models in scenarios with unlabeled data such as unsupervised domain adaptation (e.g., OfficeHome and DomainNet) and semi-supervised learning (e.g., CIFAR-100 with 400 labeled samples and ImageNet with 1% labeled samples), achieving the new state-of-the-art performances.
