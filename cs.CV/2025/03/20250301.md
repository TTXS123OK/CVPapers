- **Summary**: We present a snapshot imaging technique for recovering 3D surrounding views of miniature scenes. Due to their intricacy, miniature scenes with objects sized in millimeters are difficult to reconstruct, yet miniatures are common in life and their 3D digitalization is desirable. We design a catadioptric imaging system with a single camera and eight pairs of planar mirrors for snapshot 3D reconstruction from a dollhouse perspective. We place paired mirrors on nested pyramid surfaces for capturing surrounding multi-view images in a single shot. Our mirror design is customizable based on the size of the scene for optimized view coverage. We use the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. We overcome the challenge posed by our sparse view input by integrating visual hull-derived depth constraint. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a variety of synthetic and real miniature scenes.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for various medical applications. However, their success depends on large, high-quality datasets that are challenging to obtain due to privacy concerns and costly annotation. Generative models, such as diffusion models, offer a potential solution by synthesizing medical images, but their practical adoption is hindered by long inference times. In this paper, we propose the use of an optimal transport flow matching approach to accelerate image generation. By introducing a straighter mapping between the source and target distribution, our method significantly reduces inference time while preserving and further enhancing the quality of the outputs. Furthermore, this approach is highly adaptable, supporting various medical imaging modalities, conditioning mechanisms (such as class labels and masks), and different spatial dimensions, including 2D and 3D. Beyond image generation, it can also be applied to related tasks such as image enhancement. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of this framework, making it a promising advancement for medical imaging applications. Code with checkpoints and a synthetic dataset (beneficial for classification and segmentation) is now available on: https://github.com/milad1378yz/MOTFM.

- **Summary**: Retinal image plays a crucial role in diagnosing various diseases, as retinal structures provide essential diagnostic information. However, effectively capturing structural features while integrating them with contextual information from retinal images remains a challenge. In this work, we propose segmentation-guided dual-branch network for retinal disease diagnosis using retinal images and their segmentation maps, named SegImgNet. SegImgNet incorporates a segmentation module to generate multi-scale retinal structural feature maps from retinal images. The classification module employs two encoders to independently extract features from segmented images and retinal images for disease classification. To further enhance feature extraction, we introduce the Segmentation-Guided Attention (SGA) block, which leverages feature maps from the segmentation module to refine the classification process. We evaluate SegImgNet on the public AIROGS dataset and the private e-ROP dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SegImgNet consistently outperforms existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness in retinal disease diagnosis. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/hawk-sudo/SegImgNet.

- **Summary**: Despite recent progress, video generative models still struggle to animate human actions from static images, particularly when handling uncommon actions whose training data are limited. In this paper, we investigate the task of learning to animate human actions from a small number of videos -- 16 or fewer -- which is highly valuable in real-world applications like video and movie production. Few-shot learning of generalizable motion patterns while ensuring smooth transitions from the initial reference image is exceedingly challenging. We propose FLASH (Few-shot Learning to Animate and Steer Humans), which improves motion generalization by aligning motion features and inter-frame correspondence relations between videos that share the same motion but have different appearances. This approach minimizes overfitting to visual appearances in the limited training data and enhances the generalization of learned motion patterns. Additionally, FLASH extends the decoder with additional layers to compensate lost details in the latent space, fostering smooth transitions from the initial reference image. Experiments demonstrate that FLASH effectively animates images with unseen human or scene appearances into specified actions while maintaining smooth transitions from the reference image.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential due to their low energy consumption. Converting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs is an efficient way to achieve high-performance SNNs. However, many conversion methods are based on rate coding, which requires numerous spikes and longer time-steps compared to directly trained SNNs, leading to increased energy consumption and latency. This article introduces differential coding for ANN-to-SNN conversion, a novel coding scheme that reduces spike counts and energy consumption by transmitting changes in rate information rather than rates directly, and explores its application across various layers. Additionally, the threshold iteration method is proposed to optimize thresholds based on activation distribution when converting Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) to spiking neurons. Experimental results on various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers demonstrate that the proposed differential coding significantly improves accuracy while reducing energy consumption, particularly when combined with the threshold iteration method, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: We introduce abstract rendering, a method for computing a set of images by rendering a scene from a continuously varying range of camera positions. The resulting abstract image-which encodes an infinite collection of possible renderings-is represented using constraints on the image matrix, enabling rigorous uncertainty propagation through the rendering process. This capability is particularly valuable for the formal verification of vision-based autonomous systems and other safety-critical applications. Our approach operates on Gaussian splat scenes, an emerging representation in computer vision and robotics. We leverage efficient piecewise linear bound propagation to abstract fundamental rendering operations, while addressing key challenges that arise in matrix inversion and depth sorting-two operations not directly amenable to standard approximations. To handle these, we develop novel linear relational abstractions that maintain precision while ensuring computational efficiency. These abstractions not only power our abstract rendering algorithm but also provide broadly applicable tools for other rendering problems. Our implementation, AbstractSplat, is optimized for scalability, handling up to 750k Gaussians while allowing users to balance memory and runtime through tile and batch-based computation. Compared to the only existing abstract image method for mesh-based scenes, AbstractSplat achieves 2-14x speedups while preserving precision. Our results demonstrate that continuous camera motion, rotations, and scene variations can be rigorously analyzed at scale, making abstract rendering a powerful tool for uncertainty-aware vision applications.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely criticized for their overconfidence when dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, highlighting the critical need for effective OOD detection to ensure the safe deployment of DNNs in real-world settings. Existing post-hoc OOD detection methods primarily enhance the discriminative power of logit-based approaches by reshaping sample features, yet they often neglect critical information inherent in the features themselves. In this paper, we propose the Class-Aware Relative Feature-based method (CARef), which utilizes the error between a sample's feature and its class-aware average feature as a discriminative criterion. To further refine this approach, we introduce the Class-Aware Decoupled Relative Feature-based method (CADRef), which decouples sample features based on the alignment of signs between the relative feature and corresponding model weights, enhancing the discriminative capabilities of CARef. Extensive experimental results across multiple datasets and models demonstrate that both proposed methods exhibit effectiveness and robustness in OOD detection compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our two methods outperform the best baseline by 2.82% and 3.27% in AUROC, with improvements of 4.03% and 6.32% in FPR95, respectively.

- **Summary**: Visual embedding models excel at zero-shot tasks like visual retrieval and classification. However, these models cannot be used for tasks that contain ambiguity or require user instruction. These tasks necessitate a multimodal embedding model, which outputs embeddings that combine visual and natural language input. Existing CLIP-based approaches embed images and text independently, and fuse the result. We find that this results in weak interactions between modalities, and poor user control over the representation. We introduce ABC, an open-source multimodal embedding model that uses a vision-language model backbone to deeply integrate image features with natural language instructions. ABC achieves bestfor-size performance on MSCOCO image-to-text retrieval and is the top performing model on classification and VQA tasks in the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark. With a strongly unified vision-language representation, ABC can use natural language to solve subtle and potentially ambiguous visual retrieval problems. To evaluate this capability, we design CtrlBench, a benchmark that requires interleaving textual instructions with image content for correct retrieval. ABC advances the state of multimodal embeddings by offering high-quality representations and flexible natural language control. Our model and datasets are available at our project page.



### SHAZAM: Self-Supervised Change Monitoring for Hazard Detection and Mapping

- **Summary**: The increasing frequency of environmental hazards due to climate change underscores the urgent need for effective monitoring systems. Current approaches either rely on expensive labelled datasets, struggle with seasonal variations, or require multiple observations for confirmation (which delays detection). To address these challenges, this work presents SHAZAM - Self-Supervised Change Monitoring for Hazard Detection and Mapping. SHAZAM uses a lightweight conditional UNet to generate expected images of a region of interest (ROI) for any day of the year, allowing for the direct modelling of normal seasonal changes and the ability to distinguish potential hazards. A modified structural similarity measure compares the generated images with actual satellite observations to compute region-level anomaly scores and pixel-level hazard maps. Additionally, a theoretically grounded seasonal threshold eliminates the need for dataset-specific optimisation. Evaluated on four diverse datasets that contain bushfires (wildfires), burned regions, extreme and out-of-season snowfall, floods, droughts, algal blooms, and deforestation, SHAZAM achieved F1 score improvements of between 0.066 and 0.234 over existing methods. This was achieved primarily through more effective hazard detection (higher recall) while using only 473K parameters. SHAZAM demonstrated superior mapping capabilities through higher spatial resolution and improved ability to suppress background features while accentuating both immediate and gradual hazards. SHAZAM has been established as an effective and generalisable solution for hazard detection and mapping across different geographical regions and a diverse range of hazards.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising 3D representation. Much research has been focused on reducing its storage requirements and memory footprint. However, the needs to compress and transmit the 3DGS representation to the remote side are overlooked. This new application calls for rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression. How to quantize and entropy encode sparse Gaussian primitives in the 3D space remains largely unexplored. Few early attempts resort to the hyperprior framework from learned image compression. But, they fail to utilize fully the inter and intra correlation inherent in Gaussian primitives. Built on ScaffoldGS, this work, termed CAT-3DGS, introduces a context-adaptive triplane approach to their rate-distortion-optimized coding. It features multi-scale triplanes, oriented according to the principal axes of Gaussian primitives in the 3D space, to capture their inter correlation (i.e. spatial correlation) for spatial autoregressive coding in the projected 2D planes. With these triplanes serving as the hyperprior, we further perform channel-wise autoregressive coding to leverage the intra correlation within each individual Gaussian primitive. Our CAT-3DGS incorporates a view frequency-aware masking mechanism. It actively skips from coding those Gaussian primitives that potentially have little impact on the rendering quality. When trained end-to-end to strike a good rate-distortion trade-off, our CAT-3DGS achieves the state-of-the-art compression performance on the commonly used real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Instance detection (InsDet) aims to localize specific object instances within a novel scene imagery based on given visual references. Technically, it requires proposal detection to identify all possible object instances, followed by instance-level matching to pinpoint the ones of interest. Its open-world nature supports its wide-ranging applications from robotics to AR/VR, but also presents significant challenges: methods must generalize to unknown testing data distributions because (1) the testing scene imagery is unseen during training, and (2) there are domain gaps between visual references and detected proposals. Existing methods attempt to tackle these challenges by synthesizing diverse training examples or utilizing off-the-shelf foundation models (FMs). However, they only partially capitalize the available open-world information. In this paper, we approach InsDet from an Open-World perspective, introducing our method IDOW. We find that, while pretrained FMs yield high recall in instance detection, they are not specifically optimized for instance-level feature matching. To address this, we adapt pretrained FMs for improved instance-level matching using open-world data. Our approach incorporates metric learning along with novel data augmentations, which sample distractors as negative examples and synthesize novel-view instances to enrich the visual references. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior works, achieving >10 AP over previous results on two recently released challenging benchmark datasets in both conventional and novel instance detection settings.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have obtained impressive performance in visual content understanding and multi-modal reasoning. Unfortunately, these large models suffer from serious hallucination problems and tend to generate fabricated responses. Recently, several Contrastive Decoding (CD) strategies have been proposed to alleviate hallucination by introducing disturbed inputs. Although great progress has been made, these CD strategies mostly apply a one-size-fits-all approach for all input conditions. In this paper, we revisit this process through extensive experiments. Related results show that hallucination causes are hybrid and each generative step faces a unique hallucination challenge. Leveraging these meaningful insights, we introduce a simple yet effective Octopus-like framework that enables the model to adaptively identify hallucination types and create a dynamic CD workflow. Our Octopus framework not only outperforms existing methods across four benchmarks but also demonstrates excellent deployability and expansibility.

- **Summary**: Video summarization, by selecting the most informative and/or user-relevant parts of original videos to create concise summary videos, has high research value and consumer demand in today's video proliferation era. Multi-modal video summarization that accomodates user input has become a research hotspot. However, current multi-modal video summarization methods suffer from two limitations. First, existing methods inadequately fuse information from different modalities and cannot effectively utilize modality-unique features. Second, most multi-modal methods focus on video and text modalities, neglecting the audio modality, despite the fact that audio information can be very useful in certain types of videos. In this paper we propose CFSum, a transformer-based multi-modal video summarization framework with coarse-fine fusion. CFSum exploits video, text, and audio modal features as input, and incorporates a two-stage transformer-based feature fusion framework to fully utilize modality-unique information. In the first stage, multi-modal features are fused simultaneously to perform initial coarse-grained feature fusion, then, in the second stage, video and audio features are explicitly attended with the text representation yielding more fine-grained information interaction. The CFSum architecture gives equal importance to each modality, ensuring that each modal feature interacts deeply with the other modalities. Our extensive comparative experiments against prior methods and ablation studies on various datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of CFSum.

- **Summary**: Thyroid scintigraphy is a key imaging modality for diagnosing thyroid disorders. Deep learning models for thyroid scintigraphy classification often face challenges due to limited and imbalanced datasets, leading to suboptimal generalization. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of different data augmentation techniques including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching (FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA) to enhance the performance of a ResNet18 classifier for thyroid condition classification. Our results showed that FM-based augmentation consistently outperforms SD-based approaches, particularly when combined with original (O) data and CA (O+FM+CA), achieving both high accuracy and fair classification across Diffuse Goiter (DG), Nodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI) cases. The Wilcoxon statistical analysis further validated the superiority of O+FM and its variants (O+FM+CA) over SD-based augmentations in most scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of FM-based augmentation as a superior approach for generating high-quality synthetic thyroid scintigraphy images and improving model generalization in medical image classification.

- **Summary**: As two intimate reciprocal tasks, scene-aware human motion synthesis and analysis require a joint understanding between multiple modalities, including 3D body motions, 3D scenes, and textual descriptions. In this paper, we integrate these two paired processes into a Co-Evolving Synthesis-Analysis (CESA) pipeline and mutually benefit their learning. Specifically, scene-aware text-to-human synthesis generates diverse indoor motion samples from the same textual description to enrich human-scene interaction intra-class diversity, thus significantly benefiting training a robust human motion analysis system. Reciprocally, human motion analysis would enforce semantic scrutiny on each synthesized motion sample to ensure its semantic consistency with the given textual description, thus improving realistic motion synthesis. Considering that real-world indoor human motions are goal-oriented and path-guided, we propose a cascaded generation strategy that factorizes text-driven scene-specific human motion generation into three stages: goal inferring, path planning, and pose synthesizing. Coupling CESA with this powerful cascaded motion synthesis model, we jointly improve realistic human motion synthesis and robust human motion analysis in 3D scenes.

- **Summary**: Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.

- **Summary**: This study proposes a novel few-shot crack image classification model based on CLIP and Bayesian optimization. By combining multimodal information and Bayesian approach, the model achieves efficient classification of crack images in a small number of training samples. The CLIP model employs its robust feature extraction capabilities to facilitate precise classification with a limited number of samples. In contrast, Bayesian optimisation enhances the robustness and generalization of the model, while reducing the reliance on extensive labelled data. The results demonstrate that the model exhibits robust performance across a diverse range of dataset scales, particularly in the context of small sample sets. The study validates the potential of the method in civil engineering crack classification.

- **Summary**: Event cameras, known for their low latency and high dynamic range, show great potential in pedestrian detection applications. However, while recent research has primarily focused on improving detection accuracy, the robustness of event-based visual models against physical adversarial attacks has received limited attention. For example, adversarial physical objects, such as specific clothing patterns or accessories, can exploit inherent vulnerabilities in these systems, leading to misdetections or misclassifications. This study is the first to explore physical adversarial attacks on event-driven pedestrian detectors, specifically investigating whether certain clothing patterns worn by pedestrians can cause these detectors to fail, effectively rendering them unable to detect the person. To address this, we developed an end-to-end adversarial framework in the digital domain, framing the design of adversarial clothing textures as a 2D texture optimization problem. By crafting an effective adversarial loss function, the framework iteratively generates optimal textures through backpropagation. Our results demonstrate that the textures identified in the digital domain possess strong adversarial properties. Furthermore, we translated these digitally optimized textures into physical clothing and tested them in real-world scenarios, successfully demonstrating that the designed textures significantly degrade the performance of event-based pedestrian detection models. This work highlights the vulnerability of such models to physical adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: This paper explores a cross-modality synthesis task that infers 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) from a given text-based instruction. Existing text-to-HOI synthesis methods mainly deploy a direct mapping from texts to object-specific 3D body motions, which may encounter a performance bottleneck since the huge cross-modality gap. In this paper, we observe that those HOI samples with the same interaction intention toward different targets, e.g., "lift a chair" and "lift a cup", always encapsulate similar action-specific body motion patterns while characterizing different object-specific interaction styles. Thus, learning effective action-specific motion priors and object-specific interaction priors is crucial for a text-to-HOI model and dominates its performances on text-HOI semantic consistency and body-object interaction realism. In light of this, we propose a novel body pose generation strategy for the text-to-HOI task: infer object-agnostic canonical body action first and then enrich object-specific interaction styles. Specifically, the first canonical body action inference stage focuses on learning intra-class shareable body motion priors and mapping given text-based semantics to action-specific canonical 3D body motions. Then, in the object-specific interaction inference stage, we focus on object affordance learning and enrich object-specific interaction styles on an inferred action-specific body motion basis. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed text-to-HOI synthesis system significantly outperforms other SOTA methods on three large-scale datasets with better semantic consistency and interaction realism performances.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks have emerged as a major challenge to the trustworthy deployment of machine learning models, particularly in computer vision applications. These attacks have a varied level of potency and can be implemented in both white box and black box approaches. Practical attacks include methods to manipulate the physical world and enforce adversarial behaviour by the corresponding target neural network models. Multiple different approaches to mitigate different kinds of such attacks are available in the literature, each with their own advantages and limitations. In this survey, we present a comprehensive systematization of knowledge on adversarial defenses, focusing on two key computer vision tasks: image classification and object detection. We review the state-of-the-art adversarial defense techniques and categorize them for easier comparison. In addition, we provide a schematic representation of these categories within the context of the overall machine learning pipeline, facilitating clearer understanding and benchmarking of defenses. Furthermore, we map these defenses to the types of adversarial attacks and datasets where they are most effective, offering practical insights for researchers and practitioners. This study is necessary for understanding the scope of how the available defenses are able to address the adversarial threats, and their shortcomings as well, which is necessary for driving the research in this area in the most appropriate direction, with the aim of building trustworthy AI systems for regular practical use-cases.

- **Summary**: We propose BGM2Pose, a non-invasive 3D human pose estimation method using arbitrary music (e.g., background music) as active sensing signals. Unlike existing approaches that significantly limit practicality by employing intrusive chirp signals within the audible range, our method utilizes natural music that causes minimal discomfort to humans. Estimating human poses from standard music presents significant challenges. In contrast to sound sources specifically designed for measurement, regular music varies in both volume and pitch. These dynamic changes in signals caused by music are inevitably mixed with alterations in the sound field resulting from human motion, making it hard to extract reliable cues for pose estimation. To address these challenges, BGM2Pose introduces a Contrastive Pose Extraction Module that employs contrastive learning and hard negative sampling to eliminate musical components from the recorded data, isolating the pose information. Additionally, we propose a Frequency-wise Attention Module that enables the model to focus on subtle acoustic variations attributable to human movement by dynamically computing attention across frequency bands. Experiments suggest that our method outperforms the existing methods, demonstrating substantial potential for real-world applications. Our datasets and code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Floorplan reconstruction provides structural priors essential for reliable indoor robot navigation and high-level scene understanding. However, existing approaches either require time-consuming offline processing with a complete map, or rely on expensive sensors and substantial computational resources. To address the problems, we propose Floorplan-SLAM, which incorporates floorplan reconstruction tightly into a multi-session SLAM system by seamlessly interacting with plane extraction, pose estimation, and back-end optimization, achieving real-time, high-accuracy, and long-term floorplan reconstruction using only a stereo camera. Specifically, we present a robust plane extraction algorithm that operates in a compact plane parameter space and leverages spatially complementary features to accurately detect planar structures, even in weakly textured scenes. Furthermore, we propose a floorplan reconstruction module tightly coupled with the SLAM system, which uses continuously optimized plane landmarks and poses to formulate and solve a novel optimization problem, thereby enabling real-time incremental floorplan reconstruction. Note that by leveraging the map merging capability of multi-session SLAM, our method supports long-term floorplan reconstruction across multiple sessions without redundant data collection. Experiments on the VECtor and the self-collected datasets indicate that Floorplan-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of plane extraction robustness, pose estimation accuracy, and floorplan reconstruction fidelity and speed, achieving real-time performance at 25-45 FPS without GPU acceleration, which reduces the floorplan reconstruction time for a 1000 square meters scene from over 10 hours to just 9.44 minutes.

- **Summary**: It remains a significant challenge to compress images at ultra-low bitrate while achieving both semantic consistency and high perceptual quality. We propose a novel image compression framework, Semantically Disentangled Image Compression (SEDIC) in this paper. Our proposed SEDIC leverages large multimodal models (LMMs) to disentangle the image into several essential semantic information, including an extremely compressed reference image, overall and object-level text descriptions, and the semantic masks. A multi-stage semantic decoder is designed to progressively restore the transmitted reference image object-by-object, ultimately producing high-quality and perceptually consistent reconstructions. In each decoding stage, a pre-trained controllable diffusion model is utilized to restore the object details on the reference image conditioned by the text descriptions and semantic masks. Experimental results demonstrate that SEDIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency at ultra-low bitrates ($\le$ 0.05 bpp). Our code is available at https://github.com/yang-xidian/SEDIC.

- **Summary**: Perception-enhanced pre-training, particularly through grounding techniques, is widely adopted to enhance the performance of graphical user interface (GUI) agents. However, in resource-constrained scenarios, the format discrepancy between coordinate-oriented grounding and action-oriented reasoning limits the effectiveness of grounding for reasoning tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a query-oriented pivot approach called query inference, which serves as a bridge between GUI grounding and reasoning. By inferring potential user queries from a screenshot and its associated element coordinates, query inference improves the understanding of coordinates while aligning more closely with reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that query inference outperforms previous grounding techniques under the same training data scale. Notably, query inference achieves comparable or even better performance to large-scale grounding-enhanced OS-Atlas with less than 0.1% of training data. Furthermore, we explore the impact of reasoning formats and demonstrate that integrating additional semantic information into the input further boosts reasoning performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZrW00/GUIPivot.

- **Summary**: Recently, learned video compression (LVC) is undergoing a period of rapid development. However, due to absence of large and high-quality high dynamic range (HDR) video training data, LVC on HDR video is still unexplored. In this paper, we are the first to collect a large-scale HDR video benchmark dataset, named HDRVD2K, featuring huge quantity, diverse scenes and multiple motion types. HDRVD2K fills gaps of video training data and facilitate the development of LVC on HDR videos. Based on HDRVD2K, we further propose the first learned bit-depth scalable video compression (LBSVC) network for HDR videos by effectively exploiting bit-depth redundancy between videos of multiple dynamic ranges. To achieve this, we first propose a compression-friendly bit-depth enhancement module (BEM) to effectively predict original HDR videos based on compressed tone-mapped low dynamic range (LDR) videos and dynamic range prior, instead of reducing redundancy only through spatio-temporal predictions. Our method greatly improves the reconstruction quality and compression performance on HDR videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HDRVD2K on learned HDR video compression and great compression performance of our proposed LBSVC network. Code and dataset will be released in https://github.com/sdkinda/HDR-Learned-Video-Coding.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered widespread attention from researchers due to their remarkable understanding and generation capabilities in visual language tasks (e.g., visual question answering). However, the rapid pace of knowledge updates in the real world makes offline training of MLLMs costly, and when faced with non-stationary data streams, MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting during learning. In this paper, we propose an MLLMs-based dual momentum Mixture-of-Experts (CL-MoE) framework for continual visual question answering (VQA). We integrate MLLMs with continual learning to utilize the rich commonsense knowledge in LLMs. We introduce a Dual-Router MoE (RMoE) strategy to select the global and local experts using task-level and instance-level routers, to robustly assign weights to the experts most appropriate for the task. Then, we design a dynamic Momentum MoE (MMoE) to update the parameters of experts dynamically based on the relationships between the experts and tasks/instances, so that the model can absorb new knowledge while maintaining existing knowledge. The extensive experimental results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 VQA tasks, proving the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Recent open-vocabulary human-object interaction (OV-HOI) detection methods primarily rely on large language model (LLM) for generating auxiliary descriptions and leverage knowledge distilled from CLIP to detect unseen interaction categories. Despite their effectiveness, these methods face two challenges: (1) feature granularity deficiency, due to reliance on last layer visual features for text alignment, leading to the neglect of crucial object-level details from intermediate layers; (2) semantic similarity confusion, resulting from CLIP's inherent biases toward certain classes, while LLM-generated descriptions based solely on labels fail to adequately capture inter-class similarities. To address these challenges, we propose a stratified granular comparison network. First, we introduce a granularity sensing alignment module that aggregates global semantic features with local details, refining interaction representations and ensuring robust alignment between intermediate visual features and text embeddings. Second, we develop a hierarchical group comparison module that recursively compares and groups classes using LLMs, generating fine-grained and discriminative descriptions for each interaction category. Experimental results on two widely-used benchmark datasets, SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in OV-HOI detection. Codes will be released on https://github.com/Phil0212/SGC-Net.

- **Summary**: Motorized two-wheelers are a prevalent and economical means of transportation, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. However, hazardous driving practices such as triple riding and non-compliance with helmet regulations contribute significantly to accident rates. Addressing these violations through automated enforcement mechanisms can enhance traffic safety. In this paper, we propose DashCop, an end-to-end system for automated E-ticket generation. The system processes vehicle-mounted dashcam videos to detect two-wheeler traffic violations. Our contributions include: (1) a novel Segmentation and Cross-Association (SAC) module to accurately associate riders with their motorcycles, (2) a robust cross-association-based tracking algorithm optimized for the simultaneous presence of riders and motorcycles, and (3) the RideSafe-400 dataset, a comprehensive annotated dashcam video dataset for triple riding and helmet rule violations. Our system demonstrates significant improvements in violation detection, validated through extensive evaluations on the RideSafe-400 dataset.

- **Summary**: With the availability of diverse sensor modalities (i.e., RGB, Depth, Infrared) and the success of multi-modal learning, multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) has emerged as a prominent research focus. The intuition behind it is that leveraging multiple modalities can uncover more intrinsic spoofing traces. However, this approach presents more risk of misalignment. We identify two main types of misalignment: (1) \textbf{Intra-domain modality misalignment}, where the importance of each modality varies across different attacks. For instance, certain modalities (e.g., Depth) may be non-defensive against specific attacks (e.g., 3D mask), indicating that each modality has unique strengths and weaknesses in countering particular attacks. Consequently, simple fusion strategies may fall short. (2) \textbf{Inter-domain modality misalignment}, where the introduction of additional modalities exacerbates domain shifts, potentially overshadowing the benefits of complementary fusion. To tackle (1), we propose a alignment module between modalities based on mutual information, which adaptively enhances favorable modalities while suppressing unfavorable ones. To address (2), we employ a dual alignment optimization method that aligns both sub-domain hyperplanes and modality angle margins, thereby mitigating domain gaps. Our method, dubbed \textbf{D}ual \textbf{A}lignment of \textbf{D}omain and \textbf{M}odality (DADM), achieves state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments across four challenging protocols demonstrating its robustness in multi-modal domain generalization scenarios. The codes will be released soon.

- **Summary**: In the dynamic landscape of artificial intelligence, the exploration of hallucinations within vision-language (VL) models emerges as a critical frontier. This work delves into the intricacies of hallucinatory phenomena exhibited by widely used image captioners, unraveling interesting patterns. Specifically, we step upon previously introduced techniques of conceptual counterfactual explanations to address VL hallucinations. The deterministic and efficient nature of the employed conceptual counterfactuals backbone is able to suggest semantically minimal edits driven by hierarchical knowledge, so that the transition from a hallucinated caption to a non-hallucinated one is performed in a black-box manner. HalCECE, our proposed hallucination detection framework is highly interpretable, by providing semantically meaningful edits apart from standalone numbers, while the hierarchical decomposition of hallucinated concepts leads to a thorough hallucination analysis. Another novelty tied to the current work is the investigation of role hallucinations, being one of the first works to involve interconnections between visual concepts in hallucination detection. Overall, HalCECE recommends an explainable direction to the crucial field of VL hallucination detection, thus fostering trustworthy evaluation of current and future VL systems.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs), extensively pre-trained on large-scale datasets, have become essential to foundation models, allowing excellent performance on diverse downstream tasks with minimal adaptation. Consequently, there is growing interest in adapting pre-trained ViTs across various fields, including privacy-sensitive domains where clients are often reluctant to share their data. Existing adaptation methods typically require direct data access, rendering them infeasible under these constraints. A straightforward solution may be sending the pre-trained ViT to clients for local adaptation, which poses issues of model intellectual property protection and incurs heavy client computation overhead. To address these issues, we propose a novel split adaptation (SA) method that enables effective downstream adaptation while protecting data and models. SA, inspired by split learning (SL), segments the pre-trained ViT into a frontend and a backend, with only the frontend shared with the client for data representation extraction. But unlike regular SL, SA replaces frontend parameters with low-bit quantized values, preventing direct exposure of the model. SA allows the client to add bi-level noise to the frontend and the extracted data representations, ensuring data protection. Accordingly, SA incorporates data-level and model-level out-of-distribution enhancements to mitigate noise injection's impact on adaptation performance. Our SA focuses on the challenging few-shot adaptation and adopts patch retrieval augmentation for overfitting alleviation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate SA's superiority over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its defense against advanced data reconstruction attacks while preventing model leakage with minimal computation cost on the client side.

- **Summary**: One of the basic requirements of humans is clothing and this approach aims to identify the garments selected by customer during shopping, from surveillance video. The existing approaches to detect garments were developed on western wear using datasets of western clothing. They do not address Indian garments due to the increased complexity. In this work, we propose a computer vision based framework to address this problem through video surveillance. The proposed framework uses the Mixture of Gaussians background subtraction algorithm to identify the foreground present in a video frame. The visual information present in this foreground is analysed using computer vision techniques such as image segmentation to detect the various garments, the customer is interested in. The framework was tested on a dataset, that comprises of CCTV videos from a garments store. When presented with raw surveillance footage, the proposed framework demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting the interest of customer in choosing their garments by achieving a high precision and recall.

- **Summary**: Model transfer presents a solution to the challenges of segmentation in the microscopy community, where the immense cost of labelling sufficient training data is a major bottleneck in the use of deep learning. With large quantities of imaging data produced across a wide range of imaging conditions, institutes also produce many bespoke models trained on specific source data which then get collected in model banks or zoos. As the number of available models grows, so does the need for an efficient and reliable model selection method for a specific target dataset of interest. We focus on the unsupervised regime where no labels are available for the target dataset. Building on previous work linking model generalisation and consistency under perturbation, we propose the first unsupervised transferability estimator for semantic and instance segmentation tasks which doesn't require access to source training data or target domain labels. We evaluate the method on multiple segmentation problems across microscopy modalities, finding a strong correlation between the rankings based on our estimator and rankings based on target dataset performance.

- **Summary**: The analysis of sales information, is a vital step in designing an effective marketing strategy. This work proposes a novel approach to analyse the shopping behaviour of customers to identify their purchase patterns. An extended version of the Multi-Cluster Overlapping k-Means Extension (MCOKE) algorithm with weighted k-Means algorithm is utilized to map customers to the garments of interest. The age & gender traits of the customer; the time spent and the expressions exhibited while selecting garments for purchase, are utilized to associate a customer or a group of customers to a garments they are interested in. Such study on the customer base of a retail business, may help in inferring the products of interest of their consumers, and enable them in developing effective business strategies, thus ensuring customer satisfaction, loyalty, increased sales and profits.

- **Summary**: In the current information era, customer analytics play a key role in the success of any business. Since customer demographics primarily dictate their preferences, identification and utilization of age & gender information of customers in sales forecasting, may maximize retail sales. In this work, we propose a computer vision based approach to age and gender prediction in surveillance video. The proposed approach leverage the effectiveness of Wide Residual Networks and Xception deep learning models to predict age and gender demographics of the consumers. The proposed approach is designed to work with raw video captured in a typical CCTV video surveillance system. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on real-life garment store surveillance video, which is captured by low resolution camera, under non-uniform illumination, with occlusions due to crowding, and environmental noise. The system can also detect customer facial expressions during purchase in addition to demographics, that can be utilized to devise effective marketing strategies for their customer base, to maximize sales.

- **Summary**: One of the most important research challenges in upper-limb prosthetics is enhancing the user-prosthesis communication to closely resemble the experience of a natural limb. As prosthetic devices become more complex, users often struggle to control the additional degrees of freedom. In this context, leveraging shared-autonomy principles can significantly improve the usability of these systems. In this paper, we present a novel eye-in-hand prosthetic grasping system that follows these principles. Our system initiates the approach-to-grasp action based on user's command and automatically configures the DoFs of a prosthetic hand. First, it reconstructs the 3D geometry of the target object without the need of a depth camera. Then, it tracks the hand motion during the approach-to-grasp action and finally selects a candidate grasp configuration according to user's intentions. We deploy our system on the Hannes prosthetic hand and test it on able-bodied subjects and amputees to validate its effectiveness. We compare it with a multi-DoF prosthetic control baseline and find that our method enables faster grasps, while simplifying the user experience.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in convolutional neural network (CNN)-based techniques for remote sensing pansharpening have markedly enhanced image quality. However, conventional convolutional modules in these methods have two critical drawbacks. First, the sampling positions in convolution operations are confined to a fixed square window. Second, the number of sampling points is preset and remains unchanged. Given the diverse object sizes in remote sensing images, these rigid parameters lead to suboptimal feature extraction. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative convolutional module, Adaptive Rectangular Convolution (ARConv). ARConv adaptively learns both the height and width of the convolutional kernel and dynamically adjusts the number of sampling points based on the learned scale. This approach enables ARConv to effectively capture scale-specific features of various objects within an image, optimizing kernel sizes and sampling locations. Additionally, we propose ARNet, a network architecture in which ARConv is the primary convolutional module. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets reveal the superiority of our method in enhancing pansharpening performance over previous techniques. Ablation studies and visualization further confirm the efficacy of ARConv.

- **Summary**: Two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures exhibit unique physical properties, necessitating efficient and accurate characterization methods. Leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence, we introduce a deep learning-based method for efficiently characterizing heterostructures and 2D materials, specifically MoS2-MoSe2 lateral heterostructures and MoS2 flakes with varying shapes and thicknesses. By utilizing YOLO models, we achieve an accuracy rate of over 94.67% in identifying these materials. Additionally, we explore the application of transfer learning across different materials, which further enhances model performance. This model exhibits robust generalization and anti-interference ability, ensuring reliable results in diverse scenarios. To facilitate practical use, we have developed an application that enables real-time analysis directly from optical microscope images, making the process significantly faster and more cost-effective than traditional methods. This deep learning-driven approach represents a promising tool for the rapid and accurate characterization of 2D materials, opening new avenues for research and development in material science.

- **Summary**: Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to solve the challenge of identifying individuals across different temporal-spatial scenarios, viewpoints, and clothing variations. This field is gaining increasing attention in big data research and public security domains. Existing ReID research primarily relies on face recognition, gait semantic recognition, and clothing-irrelevant feature identification, which perform relatively well in scenarios with high-quality clothing change videos and images. However, these approaches depend on either single features or simple combinations of multiple features, making further performance improvements difficult. Additionally, limitations such as missing facial information, challenges in gait extraction, and inconsistent camera parameters restrict the broader application of CC-ReID. To address the above limitations, we innovatively propose a Tri-Stream Dynamic Weight Network (TSDW) that requires only images. This dynamic weighting network consists of three parallel feature streams: facial features, head-limb features, and global features. Each stream specializes in extracting its designated features, after which a gating network dynamically fuses confidence levels. The three parallel feature streams enhance recognition performance and reduce the impact of any single feature failure, thereby improving model robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (e.g., PRCC, Celeb-reID, VC-Clothes) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Significant progress has been made for speech-driven 3D face animation, but most works focus on learning the motion of mesh/geometry, ignoring the impact of dynamic texture. In this work, we reveal that dynamic texture plays a key role in rendering high-fidelity talking avatars, and introduce a high-resolution 4D dataset \textbf{TexTalk4D}, consisting of 100 minutes of audio-synced scan-level meshes with detailed 8K dynamic textures from 100 subjects. Based on the dataset, we explore the inherent correlation between motion and texture, and propose a diffusion-based framework \textbf{TexTalker} to simultaneously generate facial motions and dynamic textures from speech. Furthermore, we propose a novel pivot-based style injection strategy to capture the complicity of different texture and motion styles, which allows disentangled control. TexTalker, as the first method to generate audio-synced facial motion with dynamic texture, not only outperforms the prior arts in synthesising facial motions, but also produces realistic textures that are consistent with the underlying facial movements.

- **Summary**: In the Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment context, Mean Opinion Score values represent subjective evaluations based on retinal perception, while objective metrics assess the reproduced image on the display. Bridging these subjective and objective domains requires parametric mapping functions, which are sensitive to the observer's viewing distance. This paper introduces a novel parametric model that separates perceptual effects due to strong edge degradations from those caused by texture distortions. These effects are quantified using two distinct quality indices. The first is the Blur Equivalent Linearized Estimator, designed to measure blur on strong and isolated edges while accounting for variations in viewing distance. The second is a Complex Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, which evaluates distortions affecting texture regions. The first-order effects of the estimator are directly tied to the first index, for which we introduce the concept of \emph{focalization}, interpreted as a linearization term. Starting from a Positional Fisher Information loss model applied to Gaussian blur distortion in natural images, we demonstrate how this model can generalize to linearize all types of distortions. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings by comparing them with several state-of-the-art classical and deep-learning-based full-reference image quality assessment methods on widely used benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is complex, requiring the integration of imaging and clinical data for accurate assessment. While deep learning has shown promise in brain MRI analysis, it often functions as a black box, limiting interpretability and lacking mechanisms to effectively integrate critical clinical data such as biomarkers, medical history, and demographic information. To bridge this gap, we propose NeuroSymAD, a neuro-symbolic framework that synergizes neural networks with symbolic reasoning. A neural network percepts brain MRI scans, while a large language model (LLM) distills medical rules to guide a symbolic system in reasoning over biomarkers and medical history. This structured integration enhances both diagnostic accuracy and explainability. Experiments on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that NeuroSymAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 2.91% in accuracy and 3.43% in F1-score while providing transparent and interpretable diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Despite encouraging progress in 3D scene understanding, it remains challenging to develop an effective Large Multi-modal Model (LMM) that is capable of understanding and reasoning in complex 3D environments. Most previous methods typically encode 3D point and 2D image features separately, neglecting interactions between 2D semantics and 3D object properties, as well as the spatial relationships within the 3D environment. This limitation not only hinders comprehensive representations of 3D scene, but also compromises training and inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a unified Instance-aware 3D Large Multi-modal Model (Inst3D-LMM) to deal with multiple 3D scene understanding tasks simultaneously. To obtain the fine-grained instance-level visual tokens, we first introduce a novel Multi-view Cross-Modal Fusion (MCMF) module to inject the multi-view 2D semantics into their corresponding 3D geometric features. For scene-level relation-aware tokens, we further present a 3D Instance Spatial Relation (3D-ISR) module to capture the intricate pairwise spatial relationships among objects. Additionally, we perform end-to-end multi-task instruction tuning simultaneously without the subsequent task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across 3D scene understanding, reasoning and grounding tasks.

- **Summary**: Current research on class-incremental learning primarily focuses on single-label classification tasks. However, real-world applications often involve multi-label scenarios, such as image retrieval and medical imaging. Therefore, this paper focuses on the challenging yet practical multi-label class-incremental learning (MLCIL) problem. In addition to the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, MLCIL encounters issues related to feature confusion, encompassing inter-session and intra-feature confusion. To address these problems, we propose a novel MLCIL approach called class-independent increment (CLIN). Specifically, in contrast to existing methods that extract image-level features, we propose a class-independent incremental network (CINet) to extract multiple class-level embeddings for multi-label samples. It learns and preserves the knowledge of different classes by constructing class-specific tokens. On this basis, we develop two novel loss functions, optimizing the learning of class-specific tokens and class-level embeddings, respectively. These losses aim to distinguish between new and old classes, further alleviating the problem of feature confusion. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for improving recognition performance and mitigating forgetting on various MLCIL tasks.

- **Summary**: Efficient tracking has garnered attention for its ability to operate on resource-constrained platforms for real-world deployment beyond desktop GPUs. Current efficient trackers mainly follow precision-oriented trackers, adopting a one-stream framework with lightweight modules. However, blindly adhering to the one-stream paradigm may not be optimal, as incorporating template computation in every frame leads to redundancy, and pervasive semantic interaction between template and search region places stress on edge devices. In this work, we propose a novel asymmetric Siamese tracker named \textbf{AsymTrack} for efficient tracking. AsymTrack disentangles template and search streams into separate branches, with template computing only once during initialization to generate modulation signals. Building on this architecture, we devise an efficient template modulation mechanism to unidirectional inject crucial cues into the search features, and design an object perception enhancement module that integrates abstract semantics and local details to overcome the limited representation in lightweight tracker. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsymTrack offers superior speed-precision trade-offs across different platforms compared to the current state-of-the-arts. For instance, AsymTrack-T achieves 60.8\% AUC on LaSOT and 224/81/84 FPS on GPU/CPU/AGX, surpassing HiT-Tiny by 6.0\% AUC with higher speeds.

- **Summary**: Wake vortices - strong, coherent air turbulences created by aircraft - pose a significant risk to aviation safety and therefore require accurate and reliable detection methods. In this paper, we present an advanced, explainable machine learning method that utilizes Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for effective wake vortex detection. Our method leverages a dynamic graph CNN (DGCNN) with semantic segmentation to partition a 3D LiDAR point cloud into meaningful segments. Further refinement is achieved through clustering techniques. A novel feature of our research is the use of a perturbation-based explanation technique, which clarifies the model's decision-making processes for air traffic regulators and controllers, increasing transparency and building trust. Our experimental results, based on measured and simulated LiDAR scans compared against four baseline methods, underscore the effectiveness and reliability of our approach. This combination of semantic segmentation and clustering for real-time wake vortex tracking significantly advances aviation safety measures, ensuring that these are both effective and comprehensible.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing change detection (CD) has made significant advancements with the adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. While CNNs offer powerful feature extraction, they are constrained by receptive field limitations, and Transformers suffer from quadratic complexity when processing long sequences, restricting scalability. The Mamba architecture provides an appealing alternative, offering linear complexity and high parallelism. However, its inherent 1D processing structure causes a loss of spatial information in 2D vision tasks. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing an efficient framework based on a Vision Mamba variant that enhances its ability to capture 2D spatial information while maintaining the linear complexity characteristic of Mamba. The framework employs a 2DMamba encoder to effectively learn global spatial contextual information from multi-temporal images. For feature fusion, we introduce a 2D scan-based, channel-parallel scanning strategy combined with a spatio-temporal feature fusion method, which adeptly captures both local and global change information, alleviating spatial discontinuity issues during fusion. In the decoding stage, we present a feature change flow-based decoding method that improves the mapping of feature change information from low-resolution to high-resolution feature maps, mitigating feature shift and misalignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as LEVIR-CD+ and WHU-CD demonstrate the superior performance of our framework compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the potential of Vision Mamba for efficient and accurate remote sensing change detection.

- **Summary**: Missing modality issues are common in real-world applications, arising from factors such as equipment failures and privacy concerns. When fine-tuning pre-trained models on downstream datasets with missing modalities, performance can degrade significantly. Current methods often aggregate various missing cases to train recovery modules or align multimodal features, resulting in suboptimal performance, high computational costs, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting in continual environments where data arrives sequentially. In this paper, we formulate the dynamic missing modality problem as a continual learning task and introduce the continual multimodal missing modality task. To address this challenge efficiently, we introduce three types of prompts: modality-specific, task-aware, and task-specific prompts. These prompts enable the model to learn intra-modality, inter-modality, intra-task, and inter-task features. Furthermore, we propose a contrastive task interaction strategy to explicitly learn prompts correlating different modalities. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, where our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of AIGC technologies, the modalities generated by models have expanded from images and videos to 3D objects, leading to an increasing number of works focused on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) generative models. Existing research on copyright protection for generative models has primarily concentrated on watermarking in image and text modalities, with little exploration into the copyright protection of 3D object generative models. In this paper, we propose the first bit watermarking framework for 3DGS generative models, named GaussianSeal, to enable the decoding of bits as copyright identifiers from the rendered outputs of generated 3DGS. By incorporating adaptive bit modulation modules into the generative model and embedding them into the network blocks in an adaptive way, we achieve high-precision bit decoding with minimal training overhead while maintaining the fidelity of the model's outputs. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms post-processing watermarking approaches for 3DGS objects, achieving superior performance of watermark decoding accuracy and preserving the quality of the generated results.

- **Summary**: We propose ReKV, a novel training-free approach that enables efficient streaming video question-answering (StreamingVQA), by seamlessly integrating with existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). Traditional VideoQA systems struggle with long videos, as they must process entire videos before responding to queries, and repeat this process for each new question. In contrast, our approach analyzes long videos in a streaming manner, allowing for prompt responses as soon as user queries are received. Building on a common Video-LLM, we first incorporate a sliding-window attention mechanism, ensuring that input frames attend to a limited number of preceding frames, thereby reducing computational overhead. To prevent information loss, we store processed video key-value caches (KV-Caches) in RAM and disk, reloading them into GPU memory as needed. Additionally, we introduce a retrieval method that leverages an external retriever or the parameters within Video-LLMs to retrieve only query-relevant KV-Caches, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy in question answering. ReKV enables the separation of video encoding and question-answering across different processes and GPUs, significantly enhancing the efficiency of StreamingVQA. Through comprehensive experimentation, we validate the efficacy and practicality of our approach, which significantly boosts efficiency and enhances applicability over existing VideoQA models.

- **Summary**: Challenges in remote sensing object detection (RSOD), such as high inter-class similarity, imbalanced foreground-background distribution, and the small size of objects in remote sensing images significantly hinder detection accuracy. Moreo-ver, the trade-off between model accuracy and computational complexity poses additional constraints on the application of RSOD algorithms. To address these issues, this study proposes an efficient and lightweight RSOD algorithm integrat-ing multi-scale receptive fields and foreground focus mechanism, named RFWNet. Specifically, we proposed a lightweight backbone network Receptive Field Adaptive Selection Network (RFASNet), leveraging the rich context infor-mation of remote sensing images to enhance class separability. Additionally, we developed a Foreground Background Separation Module (FBSM) consisting of a background redundant information filtering module and a foreground information enhancement module to emphasize critical regions within images while filtering redundant background information. Finally, we designed a loss function, the Weighted CIoU-Wasserstein (WCW) loss, which weights the IoU-based loss by using the Normalized Wasserstein Distance to mitigate model sensitivity to small object position deviations. Experimental evaluations on the DOTA V1.0 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets demonstrate that RFWNet achieves advanced perfor-mance with 6.0M parameters and can achieves 52 FPS.

- **Summary**: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to capture dynamic relationships among entities by sequentially analyzing video frames and integrating visual and semantic information. However, VidSGG is challenged by significant biases that skew predictions. To mitigate these biases, we propose a VIsual and Semantic Awareness (VISA) framework for unbiased VidSGG. VISA addresses visual bias through memory-enhanced temporal integration that enhances object representations and concurrently reduces semantic bias by iteratively integrating object features with comprehensive semantic information derived from triplet relationships. This visual-semantics dual debiasing approach results in more unbiased representations of complex scene dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where VISA outperforms existing unbiased VidSGG approaches by a substantial margin (e.g., +13.1% improvement in mR@20 and mR@50 for the SGCLS task under Semi Constraint).

- **Summary**: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for intervention before irreversible neurodegeneration occurs. Structural MRI (sMRI) is widely used for AD diagnosis, but conventional deep learning approaches primarily rely on intensity-based features, which require large datasets to capture subtle structural changes. Jacobian determinant maps (JSM) provide complementary information by encoding localized brain deformations, yet existing multimodal fusion strategies fail to fully integrate these features with sMRI. We propose a cross-attention fusion framework to model the intrinsic relationship between sMRI intensity and JSM-derived deformations for AD classification. Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, we compare cross-attention, pairwise self-attention, and bottleneck attention with four pre-trained 3D image encoders. Cross-attention fusion achieves superior performance, with mean ROC-AUC scores of 0.903 (+/-0.033) for AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) and 0.692 (+/-0.061) for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. CN. Despite its strong performance, our model remains highly efficient, with only 1.56 million parameters--over 40 times fewer than ResNet-34 (63M) and Swin UNETR (61.98M). These findings demonstrate the potential of cross-attention fusion for improving AD diagnosis while maintaining computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: In transportation cyber-physical systems (CPS), ensuring safety and reliability in real-time decision-making is essential for successfully deploying autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation networks. However, these systems face significant challenges, such as computational complexity and the ability to handle ambiguous inputs like shadows in complex environments. This paper introduces a Quantum Deep Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN) designed to enhance the safety and reliability of CPS in transportation by leveraging quantum algorithms. At the core of QDCNN is the UU{\dag} method, which is utilized to improve shadow detection through a propagation algorithm that trains the centroid value with preprocessing and postprocessing operations to classify shadow regions in images accurately. The proposed QDCNN is evaluated on three datasets on normal conditions and one road affected by rain to test its robustness. It outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, achieving a shadow detection time of just 0.0049352 seconds, faster than classical algorithms like intensity-based thresholding (0.03 seconds), chromaticity-based shadow detection (1.47 seconds), and local binary pattern techniques (2.05 seconds). This remarkable speed, superior accuracy, and noise resilience demonstrate the key factors for safe navigation in autonomous transportation in real-time. This research demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced models in addressing critical limitations of classical methods, contributing to more dependable and robust autonomous transportation systems within the CPS framework.

- **Summary**: Visual layouts are essential in graphic design fields such as advertising, posters, and web interfaces. The application of generative models for content-aware layout generation has recently gained traction. However, these models fail to understand the contextual aesthetic requirements of layout design and do not align with human-like preferences, primarily treating it as a prediction task without considering the final rendered output. To overcome these problems, we offer Aesthetic-Aware Preference Alignment(AAPA), a novel technique to train a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) for layout prediction that uses MLLM's aesthetic preferences for Direct Preference Optimization over graphic layouts. We propose a data filtering protocol utilizing our layout-quality heuristics for AAPA to ensure training happens on high-quality layouts. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation metric that uses another MLLM to compute the win rate of the generated layout against the ground-truth layout based on aesthetics criteria. We also demonstrate the applicability of AAPA for MLLMs of varying scales (1B to 8B parameters) and LLM families (Qwen, Phi, InternLM). By conducting thorough qualitative and quantitative analyses, we verify the efficacy of our approach on two challenging benchmarks - Crello and Webui, showcasing 17%, and 16 improvement over current State-of-The-Art methods, thereby highlighting the potential of MLLMs in aesthetic-aware layout generation.

- **Summary**: We introduce the first method for generating Vector Displacement Maps (VDMs): parameterized, detailed geometric stamps commonly used in 3D modeling. Given a single input image, our method first generates multi-view normal maps and then reconstructs a VDM from the normals via a novel reconstruction pipeline. We also propose an efficient algorithm for extracting VDMs from 3D objects, and present the first academic VDM dataset. Compared to existing 3D generative models focusing on complete shapes, we focus on generating parts that can be seamlessly attached to shape surfaces. The method gives artists rich control over adding geometric details to a 3D shape. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines. Generating VDMs offers additional benefits, such as using 2D image editing to customize and refine 3D details.

- **Summary**: As multimedia services such as video streaming, video conferencing, virtual reality (VR), and online gaming continue to expand, ensuring high perceptual visual quality becomes a priority to maintain user satisfaction and competitiveness. However, multimedia content undergoes various distortions during acquisition, compression, transmission, and storage, resulting in the degradation of experienced quality. Thus, perceptual visual quality assessment (PVQA), which focuses on evaluating the quality of multimedia content based on human perception, is essential for optimizing user experiences in advanced communication systems. Several challenges are involved in the PVQA process, including diverse characteristics of multimedia content such as image, video, VR, point cloud, mesh, multimodality, etc., and complex distortion scenarios as well as viewing conditions. In this paper, we first present an overview of PVQA principles and methods. This includes both subjective methods, where users directly rate their experiences, and objective methods, where algorithms predict human perception based on measurable factors such as bitrate, frame rate, and compression levels. Based on the basics of PVQA, quality predictors for different multimedia data are then introduced. In addition to traditional images and videos, immersive multimedia and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) content are also discussed. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion on the future directions of PVQA research.

- **Summary**: Post-hoc importance attribution methods are a popular tool for "explaining" Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and are inherently based on the assumption that the explanations can be applied independently of how the models were trained. Contrarily, in this work we bring forward empirical evidence that challenges this very notion. Surprisingly, we discover a strong dependency on and demonstrate that the training details of a pre-trained model's classification layer (less than 10 percent of model parameters) play a crucial role, much more than the pre-training scheme itself. This is of high practical relevance: (1) as techniques for pre-training models are becoming increasingly diverse, understanding the interplay between these techniques and attribution methods is critical; (2) it sheds light on an important yet overlooked assumption of post-hoc attribution methods which can drastically impact model explanations and how they are interpreted eventually. With this finding we also present simple yet effective adjustments to the classification layers, that can significantly enhance the quality of model explanations. We validate our findings across several visual pre-training frameworks (fully-supervised, self-supervised, contrastive vision-language training) and analyse how they impact explanations for a wide range of attribution methods on a diverse set of evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Real-world low-light images captured by imaging devices suffer from poor visibility and require a domain-specific enhancement to produce artifact-free outputs that reveal details. In this paper, we propose an unpaired low-light image enhancement network leveraging novel controlled transformation-based self-supervision and unpaired self-conditioning strategies. The model determines the required degrees of enhancement at the input image pixels, which are learned from the unpaired low-lit and well-lit images without any direct supervision. The self-supervision is based on a controlled transformation of the input image and subsequent maintenance of its enhancement in spite of the transformation. The self-conditioning performs training of the model on unpaired images such that it does not enhance an already-enhanced image or a well-lit input image. The inherent noise in the input low-light images is handled by employing low gradient magnitude suppression in a detail-preserving manner. In addition, our noise handling is self-conditioned by preventing the denoising of noise-free well-lit images. The training based on low-light image enhancement-specific attributes allows our model to avoid paired supervision without compromising significantly in performance. While our proposed self-supervision aids consistent enhancement, our novel self-conditioning facilitates adequate enhancement. Extensive experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that our model, in general, outperforms the state-of-the-art both quantitatively and subjectively. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of our self-supervision and self-conditioning strategies, and the related loss functions.

- **Summary**: In environmental protection, tree monitoring plays an essential role in maintaining and improving ecosystem health. However, precise monitoring is challenging because existing datasets fail to capture continuous fine-grained changes in trees due to low-resolution images and high acquisition costs. In this paper, we introduce UAVTC, a large-scale, long-term, high-resolution dataset collected using UAVs equipped with cameras, specifically designed to detect individual Tree Changes (TCs). UAVTC includes rich annotations and statistics based on biological knowledge, offering a fine-grained view for tree monitoring. To address environmental influences and effectively model the hierarchical diversity of physiological TCs, we propose a novel Hyperbolic Siamese Network (HSN) for TC detection, enabling compact and hierarchical representations of dynamic tree changes.   Extensive experiments show that HSN can effectively capture complex hierarchical changes and provide a robust solution for fine-grained TC detection. In addition, HSN generalizes well to cross-domain face anti-spoofing task, highlighting its broader significance in AI. We believe our work, combining ecological insights and interdisciplinary expertise, will benefit the community by offering a new benchmark and innovative AI technologies.

- **Summary**: Expert radiologists visually scan Chest X-Ray (CXR) images, sequentially fixating on anatomical structures to perform disease diagnosis. An automatic multi-label classifier of diseases in CXR images can benefit by incorporating aspects of the radiologists' approach. Recorded visual scanpaths of radiologists on CXR images can be used for the said purpose. But, such scanpaths are not available for most CXR images, which creates a gap even for modern deep learning based classifiers. This paper proposes to mitigate this gap by generating effective artificial visual scanpaths using a visual scanpath prediction model for CXR images. Further, a multi-class multi-label classifier framework is proposed that uses a generated scanpath and visual image features to classify diseases in CXR images. While the scanpath predictor is based on a recurrent neural network, the multi-label classifier involves a novel iterative sequential model with an attention module. We show that our scanpath predictor generates human-like visual scanpaths. We also demonstrate that the use of artificial visual scanpaths improves multi-class multi-label disease classification results on CXR images. The above observations are made from experiments involving around 0.2 million CXR images from 2 widely-used datasets considering the multi-label classification of 14 pathological findings.

- **Summary**: Purpose The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a deep neural network (DNN) capable of generating flat-panel detector (FPD) images from digitally reconstructed radiography (DRR) images in lung cancer treatment, with the aim of improving clinical workflows in image-guided radiotherapy.   Methods A modified CycleGAN architecture was trained on paired DRR-FPD image data obtained from patients with lung tumors. The training dataset consisted of over 400 DRR-FPD image pairs, and the final model was evaluated on an independent set of 100 FPD images. Mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) were used to quantify the similarity between synthetic and ground-truth FPD images. Computation time for generating synthetic images was also measured.   Results Despite some positional mismatches in the DRR-FPD pairs, the synthetic FPD images closely resembled the ground-truth FPD images. The proposed DNN achieved notable improvements over both input DRR images and a U-Net-based method in terms of MAE, PSNR, SSIM, and KID. The average image generation time was on the order of milliseconds per image, indicating its potential for real-time application. Qualitative evaluations showed that the DNN successfully reproduced image noise patterns akin to real FPD images, reducing the need for manual noise adjustments.   Conclusions The proposed DNN effectively converted DRR images into realistic FPD images for thoracic cases, offering a fast and practical method that could streamline patient setup verification and enhance overall clinical workflow. Future work should validate the model across different imaging systems and address remaining challenges in marker visualization, thereby fostering broader clinical adoption.
