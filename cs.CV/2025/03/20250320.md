- **Summary**: We present GraPLUS (Graph-based Placement Using Semantics), a novel framework for plausible object placement in images that leverages scene graphs and large language models. Our approach uniquely combines graph-structured scene representation with semantic understanding to determine contextually appropriate object positions. The framework employs GPT-2 to transform categorical node and edge labels into rich semantic embeddings that capture both definitional characteristics and typical spatial contexts, enabling nuanced understanding of object relationships and placement patterns. GraPLUS achieves placement accuracy of 92.1% and an FID score of 28.83 on the OPA dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 8.1% while maintaining competitive visual quality. In human evaluation studies involving 964 samples assessed by 19 participants, our method was preferred in 52.1% of cases, significantly outperforming previous approaches. The framework's key innovations include: (i) leveraging pre-trained scene graph models that transfer knowledge from other domains, (ii) edge-aware graph neural networks that process scene semantics through structured relationships, (iii) a cross-modal attention mechanism that aligns categorical embeddings with enhanced scene features, and (iv) a multiobjective training strategy incorporating semantic consistency constraints.

- **Summary**: Neural surface reconstruction has been dominated by implicit representations with marching cubes for explicit surface extraction. However, those methods typically require high-quality normals for accurate reconstruction. We propose OffsetOPT, a method that reconstructs explicit surfaces directly from 3D point clouds and eliminates the need for point normals. The approach comprises two stages: first, we train a neural network to predict surface triangles based on local point geometry, given uniformly distributed training point clouds. Next, we apply the frozen network to reconstruct surfaces from unseen point clouds by optimizing a per-point offset to maximize the accuracy of triangle predictions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, OffsetOPT not only excels at reconstructing overall surfaces but also significantly preserves sharp surface features. We demonstrate its accuracy on popular benchmarks, including small-scale shapes and large-scale open surfaces.

- **Summary**: Depth imaging is a foundational building block for broad applications, such as autonomous driving and virtual/augmented reality. Traditionally, depth cameras have relied on time-of-flight sensors or multi-lens systems to achieve physical depth measurements. However, these systems often face a trade-off between a bulky form factor and imprecise approximations, limiting their suitability for spatially constrained scenarios. Inspired by the emerging advancements of nano-optics, we present Nano-3D, a metasurface-based neural depth imaging solution with an ultra-compact footprint. Nano-3D integrates our custom-fabricated 700 nm thick TiO2 metasurface with a multi-module deep neural network to extract precise metric depth information from monocular metasurface-polarized imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Nano-3D with both simulated and physical experiments. We hope the exhibited success paves the way for the community to bridge future graphics systems with emerging nanomaterial technologies through novel computational approaches.

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, open-ended question answering often suffers from unreliable evaluations because freeform responses require either complex metrics or subjective human judgment. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoDrive-QA, an automatic pipeline that converts existing driving QA datasets (including DriveLM, NuScenes-QA, and LingoQA) into a structured multiple-choice question (MCQ) format. This benchmark systematically assesses perception, prediction, and planning tasks, providing a standardized and objective evaluation framework. AutoDrive-QA employs an automated pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality, contextually relevant distractors based on domain-specific error patterns commonly found in autonomous driving scenarios. To evaluate both general capabilities and generalization performance, we test the benchmark on three public datasets and conduct zero-shot experiments on an unseen dataset. The zero-shot evaluations reveal that GPT-4V leads with 69.57% accuracy -- achieving 74.94% in Perception, 65.33% in Prediction, and 68.45% in Planning -- demonstrating that while all models excel in Perception, they struggle in Prediction. Consequently, AutoDrive-QA establishes a rigorous, unbiased standard for integrating and evaluating different vision-language models across various autonomous driving datasets, thereby improving generalization in this field. We release all the codes in the AutoDrive-QA GitHub Repository.



### UAS Visual Navigation in Large and Unseen Environments via a Meta Agent

- **Summary**: The aim of this work is to develop an approach that enables Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to efficiently learn to navigate in large-scale urban environments and transfer their acquired expertise to novel environments. To achieve this, we propose a meta-curriculum training scheme. First, meta-training allows the agent to learn a master policy to generalize across tasks. The resulting model is then fine-tuned on the downstream tasks. We organize the training curriculum in a hierarchical manner such that the agent is guided from coarse to fine towards the target task. In addition, we introduce Incremental Self-Adaptive Reinforcement learning (ISAR), an algorithm that combines the ideas of incremental learning and meta-reinforcement learning (MRL). In contrast to traditional reinforcement learning (RL), which focuses on acquiring a policy for a specific task, MRL aims to learn a policy with fast transfer ability to novel tasks. However, the MRL training process is time consuming, whereas our proposed ISAR algorithm achieves faster convergence than the conventional MRL algorithm. We evaluate the proposed methodologies in simulated environments and demonstrate that using this training philosophy in conjunction with the ISAR algorithm significantly improves the convergence speed for navigation in large-scale cities and the adaptation proficiency in novel environments.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFM) have shown a tremendous increase in performance in terms of generating high-resolution, photorealistic natural images. While VLFMs show a rich understanding of semantic content across modalities, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment tasks that require precise correspondence between image regions and textual descriptions a limitation in medical imaging, where accurate localization and detection of clinical features are essential for diagnosis and analysis. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage architecture where a pre-trained VLFM provides a cursory semantic understanding, while a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm refines the alignment through an iterative process that optimizes for understanding semantic context. The reward signal is designed to align the semantic information of the text with synthesized images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a medical imaging skin dataset where the generated images exhibit improved generation quality and alignment with prompt over the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion. We also show that the synthesized samples could be used to improve disease classifier performance for underrepresented subgroups through augmentation.



### Frequency Enhancement for Image Demosaicking

- **Summary**: Recovering high-frequency textures in image demosaicking remains a challenging issue. While existing methods introduced elaborate spatial learning methods, they still exhibit limited performance. To address this issue, a frequency enhancement approach is proposed. Based on the frequency analysis of color filter array (CFA)/demosaicked/ground truth images, we propose Dual-path Frequency Enhancement Network (DFENet), which reconstructs RGB images in a divide-and-conquer manner through fourier-domain frequency selection. In DFENet, two frequency selectors are employed, each selecting a set of frequency components for processing along separate paths. One path focuses on generating missing information through detail refinement in spatial domain, while the other aims at suppressing undesirable frequencies with the guidance of CFA images in frequency domain. Multi-level frequency supervision with a stagewise training strategy is employed to further improve the reconstruction performance. With these designs, the proposed DFENet outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms on different datasets and demonstrates significant advantages on hard cases. Moreover, to better assess algorithms' ability to reconstruct high-frequency textures, a new dataset, LineSet37, is contributed, which consists of 37 artificially designed and generated images. These images feature complex line patterns and are prone to severe visual artifacts like color moir\'e after demosaicking. Experiments on LineSet37 offer a more targeted evaluation of performance on challenging cases. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/VelvetReverie/DFENet-demosaicking.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have made significant progress in digital human generation. However, most existing models still struggle to maintain 3D consistency, temporal coherence, and motion accuracy. A key reason for these shortcomings is the limited representation ability of commonly used control signals(e.g., landmarks, depth maps, etc.). In addition, the lack of diversity in identity and pose variations in public datasets further hinders progress in this area. In this paper, we analyze the shortcomings of current control signals and introduce a novel control signal representation that is optimizable, dense, expressive, and 3D consistent. Our method embeds a learnable neural Gaussian onto a parametric head surface, which greatly enhances the consistency and expressiveness of diffusion-based head models. Regarding the dataset, we synthesize a large-scale dataset with multiple poses and identities. In addition, we use real/synthetic labels to effectively distinguish real and synthetic data, minimizing the impact of imperfections in synthetic data on the generated head images. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms existing methods in terms of realism, expressiveness, and 3D consistency. Our code, synthetic datasets, and pre-trained models will be released in our project page: https://ustc3dv.github.io/Learn2Control/

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision-language tasks but their remote sensing (RS) counterpart are relatively under explored. Unlike natural images, RS imagery presents unique challenges that current MLLMs struggle to handle, particularly in visual grounding and spatial reasoning. This study investigates the limitations of CLIP-based MLLMs in RS, highlighting their failure to differentiate visually distinct yet semantically similar RS images. To address this, we introduce a remote sensing multimodal visual patterns (RSMMVP) benchmark. It is designed to evaluate MLLMs in RS tasks by identifying the CLIP-blind pairs, where CLIP-based models incorrectly assign high similarity scores to visually distinct RS images. Through a visual question answering (VQA) evaluation, we analyze the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing significant limitations in RS specific representation learning. The results provide valuable insights into the weaknesses of CLIP-based visual encoding and offer a foundation for future research to develop more effective MLLMs tailored for remote sensing applications.

- **Summary**: 3D point cloud has been widely used in applications such as self-driving cars, robotics, CAD models, etc. To the best of our knowledge, these applications raised the issue of privacy leakage in 3D point clouds, which has not been studied well. Different from the 2D image privacy, which is related to texture and 2D geometric structure, the 3D point cloud is texture-less and only relevant to 3D geometric structure. In this work, we defined the 3D point cloud privacy problem and proposed an efficient privacy-preserving framework named PointFlowGMM that can support downstream classification and segmentation tasks without seeing the original data. Using a flow-based generative model, the point cloud is projected into a latent Gaussian mixture distributed subspace. We further designed a novel angular similarity loss to obfuscate the original geometric structure and reduce the model size from 767MB to 120MB without a decrease in recognition performance. The projected point cloud in the latent space is orthogonally rotated randomly to further protect the original geometric structure, the class-to-class relationship is preserved after rotation, thus, the protected point cloud can support the recognition task. We evaluated our model on multiple datasets and achieved comparable recognition results on encrypted point clouds compared to the original point clouds.

- **Summary**: Handling complex or nonlinear motion patterns has long posed challenges for video frame interpolation. Although recent advances in diffusion-based methods offer improvements over traditional optical flow-based approaches, they still struggle to generate sharp, temporally consistent frames in scenarios with large motion. To address this limitation, we introduce EDEN, an Enhanced Diffusion for high-quality large-motion vidEo frame iNterpolation. Our approach first utilizes a transformer-based tokenizer to produce refined latent representations of the intermediate frames for diffusion models. We then enhance the diffusion transformer with temporal attention across the process and incorporate a start-end frame difference embedding to guide the generation of dynamic motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDEN achieves state-of-the-art results across popular benchmarks, including nearly a 10% LPIPS reduction on DAVIS and SNU-FILM, and an 8% improvement on DAIN-HD.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown remarkable potential for static scene reconstruction, and recent advancements have extended its application to dynamic scenes. However, the quality of reconstructions depends heavily on high-quality input images and precise camera poses, which are not that trivial to fulfill in real-world scenarios. Capturing dynamic scenes with handheld monocular cameras, for instance, typically involves simultaneous movement of both the camera and objects within a single exposure. This combined motion frequently results in image blur that existing methods cannot adequately handle. To address these challenges, we introduce BARD-GS, a novel approach for robust dynamic scene reconstruction that effectively handles blurry inputs and imprecise camera poses. Our method comprises two main components: 1) camera motion deblurring and 2) object motion deblurring. By explicitly decomposing motion blur into camera motion blur and object motion blur and modeling them separately, we achieve significantly improved rendering results in dynamic regions. In addition, we collect a real-world motion blur dataset of dynamic scenes to evaluate our approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BARD-GS effectively reconstructs high-quality dynamic scenes under realistic conditions, significantly outperforming existing methods.

- **Summary**: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) for videos is a challenging task in computer vision. While existing approaches often focus on sophisticated architectural design and solely use recall during evaluation, we take a closer look at their predicted scene graphs and discover three critical issues with existing DSGG methods: severe precision-recall trade-off, lack of awareness on triplet importance, and inappropriate evaluation protocols. On the other hand, recent advances of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown great capabilities in video understanding, yet they have not been tested on fine-grained, frame-wise understanding tasks like DSGG. In this work, we conduct the first systematic analysis of Video LMMs for performing DSGG. Without relying on sophisticated architectural design, we show that LMMs with simple decoder-only structure can be turned into State-of-the-Art scene graph generators that effectively overcome the aforementioned issues, while requiring little finetuning (5-10% training data).



### Zero-1-to-A: Zero-Shot One Image to Animatable Head Avatars Using Video Diffusion

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Animatable head avatar generation typically requires extensive data for training. To reduce the data requirements, a natural solution is to leverage existing data-free static avatar generation methods, such as pre-trained diffusion models with score distillation sampling (SDS), which align avatars with pseudo ground-truth outputs from the diffusion model. However, directly distilling 4D avatars from video diffusion often leads to over-smooth results due to spatial and temporal inconsistencies in the generated video. To address this issue, we propose Zero-1-to-A, a robust method that synthesizes a spatial and temporal consistency dataset for 4D avatar reconstruction using the video diffusion model. Specifically, Zero-1-to-A iteratively constructs video datasets and optimizes animatable avatars in a progressive manner, ensuring that avatar quality increases smoothly and consistently throughout the learning process. This progressive learning involves two stages: (1) Spatial Consistency Learning fixes expressions and learns from front-to-side views, and (2) Temporal Consistency Learning fixes views and learns from relaxed to exaggerated expressions, generating 4D avatars in a simple-to-complex manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Zero-1-to-A improves fidelity, animation quality, and rendering speed compared to existing diffusion-based methods, providing a solution for lifelike avatar creation.

- **Summary**: We propose VideoRFSplat, a direct text-to-3D model leveraging a video generation model to generate realistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for unbounded real-world scenes. To generate diverse camera poses and unbounded spatial extent of real-world scenes, while ensuring generalization to arbitrary text prompts, previous methods fine-tune 2D generative models to jointly model camera poses and multi-view images. However, these methods suffer from instability when extending 2D generative models to joint modeling due to the modality gap, which necessitates additional models to stabilize training and inference. In this work, we propose an architecture and a sampling strategy to jointly model multi-view images and camera poses when fine-tuning a video generation model. Our core idea is a dual-stream architecture that attaches a dedicated pose generation model alongside a pre-trained video generation model via communication blocks, generating multi-view images and camera poses through separate streams. This design reduces interference between the pose and image modalities. Additionally, we propose an asynchronous sampling strategy that denoises camera poses faster than multi-view images, allowing rapidly denoised poses to condition multi-view generation, reducing mutual ambiguity and enhancing cross-modal consistency. Trained on multiple large-scale real-world datasets (RealEstate10K, MVImgNet, DL3DV-10K, ACID), VideoRFSplat outperforms existing text-to-3D direct generation methods that heavily depend on post-hoc refinement via score distillation sampling, achieving superior results without such refinement.

- **Summary**: The intrapartum ultrasound guideline established by ISUOG highlights the Angle of Progression (AoP) and Head Symphysis Distance (HSD) as pivotal metrics for assessing fetal head descent and predicting delivery outcomes. Accurate measurement of the AoP and HSD requires a structured process. This begins with identifying standardized ultrasound planes, followed by the detection of specific anatomical landmarks within the regions of the pubic symphysis and fetal head that correlate with the delivery parameters AoP and HSD. Finally, these measurements are derived based on the identified anatomical landmarks. Addressing the clinical demands and standard operation process outlined in the ISUOG guideline, we introduce the Sequential Spatial-Temporal Network (SSTN), the first interpretable model specifically designed for the video of intrapartum ultrasound analysis. The SSTN operates by first identifying ultrasound planes, then segmenting anatomical structures such as the pubic symphysis and fetal head, and finally detecting key landmarks for precise measurement of HSD and AoP. Furthermore, the cohesive framework leverages task-related information to improve accuracy and reliability. Experimental evaluations on clinical datasets demonstrate that SSTN significantly surpasses existing models, reducing the mean absolute error by 18% for AoP and 22% for HSD.

- **Summary**: Detecting DeepFakes has become a crucial research area as the widespread use of AI image generators enables the effortless creation of face-manipulated and fully synthetic content, yet existing methods are often limited to binary classification (real vs. fake) and lack interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose TruthLens, a novel and highly generalizable framework for DeepFake detection that not only determines whether an image is real or fake but also provides detailed textual reasoning for its predictions. Unlike traditional methods, TruthLens effectively handles both face-manipulated DeepFakes and fully AI-generated content while addressing fine-grained queries such as "Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?"   The architecture of TruthLens combines the global contextual understanding of multimodal large language models like PaliGemma2 with the localized feature extraction capabilities of vision-only models like DINOv2. This hybrid design leverages the complementary strengths of both models, enabling robust detection of subtle manipulations while maintaining interpretability. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy (by 2-14%) and explainability, in both in-domain and cross-data settings, generalizing effectively across traditional and emerging manipulation techniques.

- **Summary**: Image restoration is essential for enhancing degraded images across computer vision tasks. However, most existing methods address only a single type of degradation (e.g., blur, noise, or haze) at a time, limiting their real-world applicability where multiple degradations often occur simultaneously. In this paper, we propose UniCoRN, a unified image restoration approach capable of handling multiple degradation types simultaneously using a multi-head diffusion model. Specifically, we uncover the potential of low-level visual cues extracted from images in guiding a controllable diffusion model for real-world image restoration and we design a multi-head control network adaptable via a mixture-of-experts strategy. We train our model without any prior assumption of specific degradations, through a smartly designed curriculum learning recipe. Additionally, we also introduce MetaRestore, a metalens imaging benchmark containing images with multiple degradations and artifacts. Extensive evaluations on several challenging datasets, including our benchmark, demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gains and can robustly restore images with severe degradations.

- **Summary**: In this work, we tackle action-scene hallucination in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs), where models incorrectly predict actions based on the scene context or scenes based on observed actions. We observe that existing Video-LLMs often suffer from action-scene hallucination due to two main factors. First, existing Video-LLMs intermingle spatial and temporal features by applying an attention operation across all tokens. Second, they use the standard Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which causes the text tokens to overemphasize certain types of tokens depending on their sequential orders. To address these issues, we introduce MASH-VLM, Mitigating Action-Scene Hallucination in Video-LLMs through disentangled spatial-temporal representations. Our approach includes two key innovations: (1) DST-attention, a novel attention mechanism that disentangles the spatial and temporal tokens within the LLM by using masked attention to restrict direct interactions between the spatial and temporal tokens; (2) Harmonic-RoPE, which extends the dimensionality of the positional IDs, allowing the spatial and temporal tokens to maintain balanced positions relative to the text tokens. To evaluate the action-scene hallucination in Video-LLMs, we introduce the UNSCENE benchmark with 1,320 videos and 4,078 QA pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASH-VLM achieves state-of-the-art results on the UNSCENE benchmark, as well as on existing video understanding benchmarks.

- **Summary**: In recent years, data-driven techniques have greatly advanced autonomous driving systems, but the need for rare and diverse training data remains a challenge, requiring significant investment in equipment and labor. World models, which predict and generate future environmental states, offer a promising solution by synthesizing annotated video data for training. However, existing methods struggle to generate long, consistent videos without accumulating errors, especially in dynamic scenes. To address this, we propose MiLA, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, long-duration videos up to one minute. MiLA utilizes a Coarse-to-Re(fine) approach to both stabilize video generation and correct distortion of dynamic objects. Additionally, we introduce a Temporal Progressive Denoising Scheduler and Joint Denoising and Correcting Flow modules to improve the quality of generated videos. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that MiLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation quality.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have been driven by the increasing availability of paired 2D data. However, the development of 3D diffusion models has been hindered by the scarcity of high-quality 3D data, resulting in less competitive performance compared to their 2D counterparts. To address this challenge, we propose repurposing pre-trained 2D diffusion models for 3D object generation. We introduce Gaussian Atlas, a novel representation that utilizes dense 2D grids, enabling the fine-tuning of 2D diffusion models to generate 3D Gaussians. Our approach demonstrates successful transfer learning from a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to a 2D manifold flattened from 3D structures. To support model training, we compile GaussianVerse, a large-scale dataset comprising 205K high-quality 3D Gaussian fittings of various 3D objects. Our experimental results show that text-to-image diffusion models can be effectively adapted for 3D content generation, bridging the gap between 2D and 3D modeling.

- **Summary**: In zero-shot image recognition tasks, humans demonstrate remarkable flexibility in classifying unseen categories by composing known simpler concepts. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs), despite achieving significant progress through large-scale natural language supervision, often underperform in real-world applications because of sub-optimal prompt engineering and the inability to adapt effectively to target classes. To address these issues, we propose a Concept-guided Human-like Bayesian Reasoning (CHBR) framework. Grounded in Bayes' theorem, CHBR models the concept used in human image recognition as latent variables and formulates this task by summing across potential concepts, weighted by a prior distribution and a likelihood function. To tackle the intractable computation over an infinite concept space, we introduce an importance sampling algorithm that iteratively prompts large language models (LLMs) to generate discriminative concepts, emphasizing inter-class differences. We further propose three heuristic approaches involving Average Likelihood, Confidence Likelihood, and Test Time Augmentation (TTA) Likelihood, which dynamically refine the combination of concepts based on the test image. Extensive evaluations across fifteen datasets demonstrate that CHBR consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization methods.

- **Summary**: Remote work and online courses have become important methods of knowledge dissemination, leading to a large number of document-based instructional videos. Unlike traditional video datasets, these videos mainly feature rich-text images and audio that are densely packed with information closely tied to the visual content, requiring advanced multimodal understanding capabilities. However, this domain remains underexplored due to dataset availability and its inherent complexity. In this paper, we introduce the DocVideoQA task and dataset for the first time, comprising 1454 videos across 23 categories with a total duration of about 828 hours. The dataset is annotated with 154k question-answer pairs generated manually and via GPT, assessing models' comprehension, temporal awareness, and modality integration capabilities. Initially, we establish a baseline using open-source MLLMs. Recognizing the challenges in modality comprehension for document-centric videos, we present DV-LLaMA, a robust video MLLM baseline. Our method enhances unimodal feature extraction with diverse instruction-tuning data and employs contrastive learning to strengthen modality integration. Through fine-tuning, the LLM is equipped with audio-visual capabilities, leading to significant improvements in document-centric video understanding. Extensive testing on the DocVideoQA dataset shows that DV-LLaMA significantly outperforms existing models. We'll release the code and dataset to facilitate future research.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly in the field of medical image analysis, an increasing number of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are being widely applied to solve complex health and biomedical challenges. However, existing research has primarily focused on specific tasks or single modalities, which limits their applicability and generalization across diverse medical scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose UMIT, a unified multi-modal, multi-task VLM designed specifically for medical imaging tasks. UMIT is able to solve various tasks, including visual question answering, disease detection, and medical report generation. In addition, it is applicable to multiple imaging modalities (e.g., X-ray, CT and PET), covering a wide range of applications from basic diagnostics to complex lesion analysis. Moreover, UMIT supports both English and Chinese, expanding its applicability globally and ensuring accessibility to healthcare services in different linguistic contexts. To enhance the model's adaptability and task-handling capability, we design a unique two-stage training strategy and fine-tune UMIT with designed instruction templates. Through extensive empirical evaluation, UMIT outperforms previous methods in five tasks across multiple datasets. The performance of UMIT indicates that it can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency, thus providing effective solutions for medical imaging applications.

- **Summary**: Document structure analysis, aka document layout analysis, is crucial for understanding both the physical layout and logical structure of documents, serving information retrieval, document summarization, knowledge extraction, etc. Hierarchical Document Structure Analysis (HDSA) specifically aims to restore the hierarchical structure of documents created using authoring software with hierarchical schemas. Previous research has primarily followed two approaches: one focuses on tackling specific subtasks of HDSA in isolation, such as table detection or reading order prediction, while the other adopts a unified framework that uses multiple branches or modules, each designed to address a distinct task. In this work, we propose a unified relation prediction approach for HDSA, called UniHDSA, which treats various HDSA sub-tasks as relation prediction problems and consolidates relation prediction labels into a unified label space. This allows a single relation prediction module to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, whether at a page-level or document-level structure analysis. To validate the effectiveness of UniHDSA, we develop a multimodal end-to-end system based on Transformer architectures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a hierarchical document structure analysis benchmark, Comp-HRDoc, and competitive results on a large-scale document layout analysis dataset, DocLayNet, effectively illustrating the superiority of our method across all sub-tasks.

- **Summary**: Understanding scene contexts is crucial for machines to perform tasks and adapt prior knowledge in unseen or noisy 3D environments. As data-driven learning is intractable to comprehensively encapsulate diverse ranges of layouts and open spaces, we propose teaching machines to identify relational commonalities in 3D spaces. Instead of focusing on point-wise or object-wise representations, we introduce 3D scene analogies, which are smooth maps between 3D scene regions that align spatial relationships. Unlike well-studied single instance-level maps, these scene-level maps smoothly link large scene regions, potentially enabling unique applications in trajectory transfer in AR/VR, long demonstration transfer for imitation learning, and context-aware object rearrangement. To find 3D scene analogies, we propose neural contextual scene maps, which extract descriptor fields summarizing semantic and geometric contexts, and holistically align them in a coarse-to-fine manner for map estimation. This approach reduces reliance on individual feature points, making it robust to input noise or shape variations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying scene analogies and transferring trajectories or object placements in diverse indoor scenes, indicating its potential for robotics and AR/VR applications.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing human-object interactions (HOI) from single images is fundamental in computer vision. Existing methods are primarily trained and tested on indoor scenes due to the lack of 3D data, particularly constrained by the object variety, making it challenging to generalize to real-world scenes with a wide range of objects. The limitations of previous 3D HOI datasets were primarily due to the difficulty in acquiring 3D object assets. However, with the development of 3D reconstruction from single images, recently it has become possible to reconstruct various objects from 2D HOI images. We therefore propose a pipeline for annotating fine-grained 3D humans, objects, and their interactions from single images. We annotated 2.5k+ 3D HOI assets from existing 2D HOI datasets and built the first open-vocabulary in-the-wild 3D HOI dataset Open3DHOI, to serve as a future test set. Moreover, we design a novel Gaussian-HOI optimizer, which efficiently reconstructs the spatial interactions between humans and objects while learning the contact regions. Besides the 3D HOI reconstruction, we also propose several new tasks for 3D HOI understanding to pave the way for future work. Data and code will be publicly available at https://wenboran2002.github.io/3dhoi.



### Jasmine: Harnessing Diffusion Prior for Self-supervised Depth Estimation

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose Jasmine, the first Stable Diffusion (SD)-based self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation, which effectively harnesses SD's visual priors to enhance the sharpness and generalization of unsupervised prediction. Previous SD-based methods are all supervised since adapting diffusion models for dense prediction requires high-precision supervision. In contrast, self-supervised reprojection suffers from inherent challenges (e.g., occlusions, texture-less regions, illumination variance), and the predictions exhibit blurs and artifacts that severely compromise SD's latent priors. To resolve this, we construct a novel surrogate task of hybrid image reconstruction. Without any additional supervision, it preserves the detail priors of SD models by reconstructing the images themselves while preventing depth estimation from degradation. Furthermore, to address the inherent misalignment between SD's scale and shift invariant estimation and self-supervised scale-invariant depth estimation, we build the Scale-Shift GRU. It not only bridges this distribution gap but also isolates the fine-grained texture of SD output against the interference of reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jasmine achieves SoTA performance on the KITTI benchmark and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent methods, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in novel view synthesis. However, despite their success in producing high-quality images for viewpoints similar to those seen during training, they struggle when generating detailed images from viewpoints that significantly deviate from the training set, particularly in close-up views. The primary challenge stems from the lack of specific training data for close-up views, leading to the inability of current methods to render these views accurately. To address this issue, we introduce a novel pseudo-label-based learning strategy. This approach leverages pseudo-labels derived from existing training data to provide targeted supervision across a wide range of close-up viewpoints. Recognizing the absence of benchmarks for this specific challenge, we also present a new dataset designed to assess the effectiveness of both current and future methods in this area. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

- **Summary**: Existing domain generalization methods for LiDAR semantic segmentation under adverse weather struggle to accurately predict "things" categories compared to "stuff" categories. In typical driving scenes, "things" categories can be dynamic and associated with higher collision risks, making them crucial for safe navigation and planning. Recognizing the importance of "things" categories, we identify their performance drop as a serious bottleneck in existing approaches. We observed that adverse weather induces degradation of semantic-level features and both corruption of local features, leading to a misprediction of "things" as "stuff". To mitigate these corruptions, we suggest our method, NTN - segmeNt Things for No-accident. To address semantic-level feature corruption, we bind each point feature to its superclass, preventing the misprediction of things classes into visually dissimilar categories. Additionally, to enhance robustness against local corruption caused by adverse weather, we define each LiDAR beam as a local region and propose a regularization term that aligns the clean data with its corrupted counterpart in feature space. NTN achieves state-of-the-art performance with a +2.6 mIoU gain on the SemanticKITTI-to-SemanticSTF benchmark and +7.9 mIoU on the SemanticPOSS-to-SemanticSTF benchmark. Notably, NTN achieves a +4.8 and +7.9 mIoU improvement on "things" classes, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: We introduce the hfut-lmc team's solution to the SLRTP Sign Production Challenge. The challenge aims to generate semantically aligned sign language pose sequences from text inputs. To this end, we propose a Text-driven Diffusion Model (TDM) framework. During the training phase, TDM utilizes an encoder to encode text sequences and incorporates them into the diffusion model as conditional input to generate sign pose sequences. To guarantee the high quality and accuracy of the generated pose sequences, we utilize two key loss functions. The joint loss function L_{joint} is used to precisely measure and minimize the differences between the joint positions of the generated pose sequences and those of the ground truth. Similarly, the bone orientation loss function L_{bone} is instrumental in ensuring that the orientation of the bones in the generated poses aligns with the actual, correct orientations. In the inference stage, the TDM framework takes on a different yet equally important task. It starts with noisy sequences and, under the strict constraints of the text conditions, gradually refines and generates semantically consistent sign language pose sequences. Our carefully designed framework performs well on the sign language production task, and our solution achieves a BLEU-1 score of 20.17, placing second in the challenge.

- **Summary**: Accurate 3D scene reconstruction is essential for numerous medical tasks. Given the challenges in obtaining ground truth data, there has been an increasing focus on self-supervised learning (SSL) for endoscopic depth estimation as a basis for scene reconstruction. While foundation models have shown remarkable progress in visual tasks, their direct application to the medical domain often leads to suboptimal results. However, the visual features from these models can still enhance endoscopic tasks, emphasizing the need for efficient adaptation strategies, which still lack exploration currently. In this paper, we introduce Endo3DAC, a unified framework for endoscopic scene reconstruction that efficiently adapts foundation models. We design an integrated network capable of simultaneously estimating depth maps, relative poses, and camera intrinsic parameters. By freezing the backbone foundation model and training only the specially designed Gated Dynamic Vector-Based Low-Rank Adaptation (GDV-LoRA) with separate decoder heads, Endo3DAC achieves superior depth and pose estimation while maintaining training efficiency. Additionally, we propose a 3D scene reconstruction pipeline that optimizes depth maps' scales, shifts, and a few parameters based on our integrated network. Extensive experiments across four endoscopic datasets demonstrate that Endo3DAC significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer trainable parameters. To our knowledge, we are the first to utilize a single network that only requires surgical videos to perform both SSL depth estimation and scene reconstruction tasks. The code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities, particularly with recent advancements leveraging transformer architectures to improve both visual and artistic quality. However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.

- **Summary**: While deep neural networks have revolutionized image denoising capabilities, their deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to substantial computational and memory requirements. To this end, we present DnLUT, an ultra-efficient lookup table-based framework that achieves high-quality color image denoising with minimal resource consumption. Our key innovation lies in two complementary components: a Pairwise Channel Mixer (PCM) that effectively captures inter-channel correlations and spatial dependencies in parallel, and a novel L-shaped convolution design that maximizes receptive field coverage while minimizing storage overhead. By converting these components into optimized lookup tables post-training, DnLUT achieves remarkable efficiency - requiring only 500KB storage and 0.1% energy consumption compared to its CNN contestant DnCNN, while delivering 20X faster inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DnLUT outperforms all existing LUT-based methods by over 1dB in PSNR, establishing a new state-of-the-art in resource-efficient color image denoising. The project is available at https://github.com/Stephen0808/DnLUT.

- **Summary**: Global effective receptive field plays a crucial role for image style transfer (ST) to obtain high-quality stylized results. However, existing ST backbones (e.g., CNNs and Transformers) suffer huge computational complexity to achieve global receptive fields. Recently, the State Space Model (SSM), especially the improved variant Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, which offers a approach to resolve the above dilemma. In this paper, we develop a Mamba-based style transfer framework, termed SaMam. Specifically, a mamba encoder is designed to efficiently extract content and style information. In addition, a style-aware mamba decoder is developed to flexibly adapt to various styles. Moreover, to address the problems of local pixel forgetting, channel redundancy and spatial discontinuity of existing SSMs, we introduce both local enhancement and zigzag scan. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our SaMam outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Automated radiology report generation aims to expedite the tedious and error-prone reporting process for radiologists. While recent works have made progress, learning to align medical images and textual findings remains challenging due to the relative scarcity of labeled medical data. For example, datasets for this task are much smaller than those used for image captioning in computer vision. In this work, we propose to transfer representations from CLIP, a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model, to better capture cross-modal semantics between images and texts. However, directly applying CLIP is suboptimal due to the domain gap between natural images and radiology. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce UniCrossAdapter, lightweight adapter modules that are incorporated into CLIP and fine-tuned on the target task while keeping base parameters fixed. The adapters are distributed across modalities and their interaction to enhance vision-language alignment. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, advancing state-of-the-art in radiology report generation. The proposed transfer learning framework provides a means of harnessing semantic knowledge from large-scale pre-trained models to tackle data-scarce medical vision-language tasks.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Quantifying the realism of images remains a challenging problem in the field of artificial intelligence. For example, an image of Albert Einstein holding a smartphone violates common-sense because modern smartphone were invented after Einstein's death. We introduce a novel method for assessing image realism using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our approach is based on the premise that LVLMs may generate hallucinations when confronted with images that defy common sense. Using LVLM to extract atomic facts from these images, we obtain a mix of accurate facts and erroneous hallucinations. We proceed by calculating pairwise entailment scores among these facts, subsequently aggregating these values to yield a singular reality score. This process serves to identify contradictions between genuine facts and hallucinatory elements, signaling the presence of images that violate common sense. Our approach has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot mode on the WHOOPS! dataset.

- **Summary**: Referring medical image segmentation targets delineating lesions indicated by textual descriptions. Aligning visual and textual cues is challenging due to their distinct data properties. Inspired by large-scale pre-trained vision-language models, we propose CausalCLIPSeg, an end-to-end framework for referring medical image segmentation that leverages CLIP. Despite not being trained on medical data, we enforce CLIP's rich semantic space onto the medical domain by a tailored cross-modal decoding method to achieve text-to-pixel alignment. Furthermore, to mitigate confounding bias that may cause the model to learn spurious correlations instead of meaningful causal relationships, CausalCLIPSeg introduces a causal intervention module which self-annotates confounders and excavates causal features from inputs for segmentation judgments. We also devise an adversarial min-max game to optimize causal features while penalizing confounding ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models for Earth observation (EO) typically rely on the visual spectrum of data as the only model input, thus failing to leverage the rich spectral information available in the multispectral channels recorded by satellites. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range. Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and corresponding textual descriptions generated with Llama3-LLaVA-Next and Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by 6.77% on average and retrieval performance by 4.63% mAP compared to the second-best model. Our results emphasize the relevance of multispectral vision-language learning. We release the image-caption dataset, code, and model weights under an open-source license.

- **Summary**: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) plays a crucial role in human affective analysis and has been widely applied in computer vision tasks such as human-computer interaction and psychological assessment. The 8th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW) Challenge aims to assess human emotions using the video-based Aff-Wild2 dataset. This challenge includes various tasks, including the video-based EXPR recognition track, which is our primary focus. In this paper, we demonstrate that addressing label ambiguity and class imbalance, which are known to cause performance degradation, can lead to meaningful performance improvements. Specifically, we propose Video-based Noise-aware Adaptive Weighting (V-NAW), which adaptively assigns importance to each frame in a clip to address label ambiguity and effectively capture temporal variations in facial expressions. Furthermore, we introduce a simple and effective augmentation strategy to reduce redundancy between consecutive frames, which is a primary cause of overfitting. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in video-based FER performance.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained on tremendous image-text pairs, vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated promising zero-shot generalization across numerous image-based tasks. However, extending these capabilities to video tasks remains challenging due to limited labeled video data and high training costs. Recent video prompting methods attempt to adapt CLIP for video tasks by introducing learnable prompts, but they typically rely on a single static prompt for all video sequences, overlooking the diverse temporal dynamics and spatial variations that exist across frames. This limitation significantly hinders the model's ability to capture essential temporal information for effective video understanding. To address this, we propose an integrated Spatial-TempOral dynamic Prompting (STOP) model which consists of two complementary modules, the intra-frame spatial prompting and inter-frame temporal prompting. Our intra-frame spatial prompts are designed to adaptively highlight discriminative regions within each frame by leveraging intra-frame attention and temporal variation, allowing the model to focus on areas with substantial temporal dynamics and capture fine-grained spatial details. Additionally, to highlight the varying importance of frames for video understanding, we further introduce inter-frame temporal prompts, dynamically inserting prompts between frames with high temporal variance as measured by frame similarity. This enables the model to prioritize key frames and enhances its capacity to understand temporal dependencies across sequences. Extensive experiments on various video benchmarks demonstrate that STOP consistently achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/CVPR2025-STOP.

- **Summary**: We present Acc3D to tackle the challenge of accelerating the diffusion process to generate 3D models from single images. To derive high-quality reconstructions through few-step inferences, we emphasize the critical issue of regularizing the learning of score function in states of random noise. To this end, we propose edge consistency, i.e., consistent predictions across the high signal-to-noise ratio region, to enhance a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling a distillation-based refinement of the endpoint score function. Building on those distilled diffusion models, we propose an adversarial augmentation strategy to further enrich the generation detail and boost overall generation quality. The two modules complement each other, mutually reinforcing to elevate generative performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Acc3D not only achieves over a $20\times$ increase in computational efficiency but also yields notable quality improvements, compared to the state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: In daily life, we encounter diverse external stimuli, such as images, sounds, and videos. As research in multimodal stimuli and neuroscience advances, fMRI-based brain decoding has become a key tool for understanding brain perception and its complex cognitive processes. Decoding brain signals to reconstruct stimuli not only reveals intricate neural mechanisms but also drives progress in AI, disease treatment, and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advancements in neuroimaging and image generation models have significantly improved fMRI-based decoding. While fMRI offers high spatial resolution for precise brain activity mapping, its low temporal resolution and signal noise pose challenges. Meanwhile, techniques like GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models have enhanced reconstructed image quality, and multimodal pre-trained models have boosted cross-modal decoding tasks. This survey systematically reviews recent progress in fMRI-based brain decoding, focusing on stimulus reconstruction from passive brain signals. It summarizes datasets, relevant brain regions, and categorizes existing methods by model structure. Additionally, it evaluates model performance and discusses their effectiveness. Finally, it identifies key challenges and proposes future research directions, offering valuable insights for the field.

- **Summary**: Contemporary image restoration and super-resolution techniques effectively harness deep neural networks, markedly outperforming traditional methods. However, astrophotography presents unique challenges for deep learning due to limited training data. This work explores hybrid strategies, such as the Deep Image Prior (DIP) model, which facilitates blind training but is susceptible to overfitting, artifact generation, and instability when handling noisy images. We propose enhancements to the DIP model's baseline performance through several advanced techniques. First, we refine the model to process multiple frames concurrently, employing the Back Projection method and the TVNet model. Next, we adopt a Markov approach incorporating Monte Carlo estimation, Langevin dynamics, and a variational input technique to achieve unbiased estimates with minimal variance and counteract overfitting effectively. Collectively, these modifications reduce the likelihood of noise learning and mitigate loss function fluctuations during training, enhancing result stability. We validated our algorithm across multiple image sets of astronomical and celestial objects, achieving performance that not only mitigates limitations of Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique that remains a standard in astronomical image reconstruction but surpasses the original DIP model, state of the art transformer- and diffusion-based models, underscoring the significance of our improvements.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) based on Transformers have garnered significant attention due to their superior performance and high energy efficiency. However, the spiking attention modules of most existing Transformer-based SNNs are adapted from those of analog Transformers, failing to fully address the issue of over-allocating attention to irrelevant contexts. To fix this fundamental yet overlooked issue, we propose a Lateral Inhibition-inspired Spiking Transformer (SpiLiFormer). It emulates the brain's lateral inhibition mechanism, guiding the model to enhance attention to relevant tokens while suppressing attention to irrelevant ones. Our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10 (+0.45%), CIFAR-100 (+0.48%), CIFAR10-DVS (+2.70%), N-Caltech101 (+1.94%), and ImageNet-1K (+1.6%). Notably, on the ImageNet-1K dataset, SpiLiFormer (69.9M parameters, 4 time steps, 384 resolution) outperforms E-SpikeFormer (173.0M parameters, 8 time steps, 384 resolution), a SOTA spiking Transformer, by 0.46% using only 39% of the parameters and half the time steps. Our code and training checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Animation of humanoid characters is essential in various graphics applications, but requires significant time and cost to create realistic animations. We propose an approach to synthesize 4D animated sequences of input static 3D humanoid meshes, leveraging strong generalized motion priors from generative video models -- as such video models contain powerful motion information covering a wide variety of human motions. From an input static 3D humanoid mesh and a text prompt describing the desired animation, we synthesize a corresponding video conditioned on a rendered image of the 3D mesh. We then employ an underlying SMPL representation to animate the corresponding 3D mesh according to the video-generated motion, based on our motion optimization. This enables a cost-effective and accessible solution to enable the synthesis of diverse and realistic 4D animations.

- **Summary**: 3D detection is a critical task to understand spatial characteristics of the environment and is used in a variety of applications including robotics, augmented reality, and image retrieval. Training performant detection models require diverse, precisely annotated, and large scale datasets that involve complex and expensive creation processes. Hence, there are only few public 3D datasets that are additionally limited in their range of classes. In this work, we propose a pipeline for automatic generation of 3D datasets for arbitrary objects. By utilizing the universal 3D representation and rendering capabilities of Radiance Fields, our pipeline generates high quality 3D models for arbitrary objects. These 3D models serve as input for a synthetic dataset generator. Our pipeline is fast, easy to use and has a high degree of automation. Our experiments demonstrate, that 3D pose estimation networks, trained with our generated datasets, archive strong performance in typical application scenarios.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes SenseExpo, an efficient autonomous exploration framework based on a lightweight prediction network, which addresses the limitations of traditional methods in computational overhead and environmental generalization. By integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformer, and Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC), we designed a lightweight prediction model with merely 709k parameters. Our smallest model achieves better performance on the KTH dataset than U-net (24.5M) and LaMa (51M), delivering PSNR 9.026 and SSIM 0.718, particularly representing a 38.7% PSNR improvement over the 51M-parameter LaMa model. Cross-domain testing demonstrates its strong generalization capability, with an FID score of 161.55 on the HouseExpo dataset, significantly outperforming comparable methods. Regarding exploration efficiency, on the KTH dataset,SenseExpo demonstrates approximately a 67.9% time reduction in exploration time compared to MapEx. On the MRPB 1.0 dataset, SenseExpo achieves 77.1% time reduction roughly compared to MapEx. Deployed as a plug-and-play ROS node, the framework seamlessly integrates with existing navigation systems, providing an efficient solution for resource-constrained devices.

- **Summary**: This work introduces GazeSCRNN, a novel spiking convolutional recurrent neural network designed for event-based near-eye gaze tracking. Leveraging the high temporal resolution, energy efficiency, and compatibility of Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) cameras with event-based systems, GazeSCRNN uses a spiking neural network (SNN) to address the limitations of traditional gaze-tracking systems in capturing dynamic movements. The proposed model processes event streams from DVS cameras using Adaptive Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (ALIF) neurons and a hybrid architecture optimized for spatio-temporal data. Extensive evaluations on the EV-Eye dataset demonstrate the model's accuracy in predicting gaze vectors. In addition, we conducted ablation studies to reveal the importance of the ALIF neurons, dynamic event framing, and training techniques, such as Forward-Propagation-Through-Time, in enhancing overall system performance. The most accurate model achieved a Mean Angle Error (MAE) of 6.034{\deg} and a Mean Pupil Error (MPE) of 2.094 mm. Consequently, this work is pioneering in demonstrating the feasibility of using SNNs for event-based gaze tracking, while shedding light on critical challenges and opportunities for further improvement.

- **Summary**: Flexible instruction-guided 6-DoF grasping is a significant yet challenging task for real-world robotic systems. Existing methods utilize the contextual understanding capabilities of the large language models (LLMs) to establish mappings between expressions and targets, allowing robots to comprehend users' intentions in the instructions. However, the LLM's knowledge about objects' physical properties remains underexplored despite its tight relevance to grasping. In this work, we propose GraspCoT, a 6-DoF grasp detection framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism oriented to physical properties, guided by auxiliary question-answering (QA) tasks. Particularly, we design a set of QA templates to enable hierarchical reasoning that includes three stages: target parsing, physical property analysis, and grasp action selection. Moreover, GraspCoT presents a unified multimodal LLM architecture, which encodes multi-view observations of 3D scenes into 3D-aware visual tokens, and then jointly embeds these visual tokens with CoT-derived textual tokens within LLMs to generate grasp pose predictions. Furthermore, we present IntentGrasp, a large-scale benchmark that fills the gap in public datasets for multi-object grasp detection under diverse and indirect verbal commands. Extensive experiments on IntentGrasp demonstrate the superiority of our method, with additional validation in real-world robotic applications confirming its practicality. Codes and data will be released.

- **Summary**: Personalizing image generation and editing is particularly challenging when we only have a few images of the subject, or even a single image. A common approach to personalization is concept learning, which can integrate the subject into existing models relatively quickly, but produces images whose quality tends to deteriorate quickly when the number of subject images is small. Quality can be improved by pre-training an encoder, but training restricts generation to the training distribution, and is time consuming. It is still an open hard challenge to personalize image generation and editing from a single image without training. Here, we present SISO, a novel, training-free approach based on optimizing a similarity score with an input subject image. More specifically, SISO iteratively generates images and optimizes the model based on loss of similarity with the given subject image until a satisfactory level of similarity is achieved, allowing plug-and-play optimization to any image generator. We evaluated SISO in two tasks, image editing and image generation, using a diverse data set of personal subjects, and demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in image quality, subject fidelity, and background preservation.

- **Summary**: Video question answering (VideoQA) enables machines to extract and comprehend key information from videos through natural language interaction, which is a critical step towards achieving intelligence. However, the demand for a thorough understanding of videos and high computational costs still limit the widespread applications of VideoQA. To address it, we propose Agentic Keyframe Search (AKeyS), a simple yet powerful algorithm for identifying keyframes in the VideoQA task. It can effectively distinguish key information from redundant, irrelevant content by leveraging modern language agents to direct classical search algorithms. Specifically, we first segment the video and organize it as a tree structure. Then, AKeyS uses a language agent to estimate heuristics and movement costs while dynamically expanding nodes. Finally, the agent determines if sufficient keyframes have been collected based on termination conditions and provides answers. Extensive experiments on the EgoSchema and NExT-QA datasets show that AKeyS outperforms all previous methods with the highest keyframe searching efficiency, which means it can accurately identify key information and conduct effective visual reasoning with minimal computational overhead. For example, on the EgoSchema subset, it achieves 1.8% higher accuracy while processing only 43.5% of the frames compared to VideoTree. We believe that AKeyS represents a significant step towards building intelligent agents for video understanding. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/fansunqi/AKeyS.

- **Summary**: Recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been challenged by the computational overhead resulting from massive video frames, often alleviated through compression strategies. However, the visual content is not equally contributed to user instructions, existing strategies (\eg, average pool) inevitably lead to the loss of potentially useful information. To tackle this, we propose the Hybrid-level Instruction Injection Strategy for Conditional Token Compression in MLLMs (HICom), utilizing the instruction as a condition to guide the compression from both local and global levels. This encourages the compression to retain the maximum amount of user-focused information while reducing visual tokens to minimize computational burden. Specifically, the instruction condition is injected into the grouped visual tokens at the local level and the learnable tokens at the global level, and we conduct the attention mechanism to complete the conditional compression. From the hybrid-level compression, the instruction-relevant visual parts are highlighted while the temporal-spatial structure is also preserved for easier understanding of LLMs. To further unleash the potential of HICom, we introduce a new conditional pre-training stage with our proposed dataset HICom-248K. Experiments show that our HICom can obtain distinguished video understanding ability with fewer tokens, increasing the performance by 2.43\% average on three multiple-choice QA benchmarks and saving 78.8\% tokens compared with the SOTA method.

- **Summary**: Solving fish segmentation in underwater videos, a real-world problem of great practical value in marine and aquaculture industry, is a challenging task due to the difficulty of the filming environment, poor visibility and limited existing annotated underwater fish data. In order to overcome these obstacles, we introduce a novel two stage unsupervised segmentation approach that requires no human annotations and combines artificially created and real images. Our method generates challenging synthetic training data, by placing virtual fish in real-world underwater habitats, after performing fish transformations such as Thin Plate Spline shape warping and color Histogram Matching, which realistically integrate synthetic fish into the backgrounds, making the generated images increasingly closer to the real world data with every stage of our approach. While we validate our unsupervised method on the popular DeepFish dataset, obtaining a performance close to a fully-supervised SoTA model, we further show its effectiveness on the specific case of salmon segmentation in underwater videos, for which we introduce DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature (30 GB). Moreover, on both datasets we prove the capability of our approach to boost the performance of the fully-supervised SoTA model.

- **Summary**: The complex nature of medical image segmentation calls for models that are specifically designed to capture detailed, domain-specific features. Large foundation models offer considerable flexibility, yet the cost of fine-tuning these models remains a significant barrier. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently update model weights with low-rank matrices but may suffer from underfitting when the chosen rank is insufficient to capture domain-specific nuances. Conversely, full-rank Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based methods provide comprehensive updates by modifying all singular values, yet they often lack flexibility and exhibit variable performance across datasets. We propose SALT (Singular Value Adaptation with Low-Rank Transformation), a method that selectively adapts the most influential singular values using trainable scale and shift parameters while complementing this with a low-rank update for the remaining subspace. This hybrid approach harnesses the advantages of both LoRA and SVD, enabling effective adaptation without relying on increasing model size or depth. Evaluated on 5 challenging medical datasets, ranging from as few as 20 samples to 1000, SALT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT (LoRA and SVD) by 2% to 5% in Dice with only 3.9% trainable parameters, demonstrating robust adaptation even in low-resource settings.

- **Summary**: Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of measurement systems, which are integral to various vision-based instrumentation and measurement applications. These systems often require clear and detailed images for precise object detection and recognition. However, images captured by visual measurement tools frequently suffer from degradation, including blurring and loss of detail, which can impede measurement accuracy.As a potential remedy, we in this paper propose a Semantic-Guided Global-Local Collaborative Network (SGGLC-Net) for lightweight SISR. Our SGGLC-Net leverages semantic priors extracted from a pre-trained model to guide the super-resolution process, enhancing image detail quality effectively. Specifically,we propose a Semantic Guidance Module that seamlessly integrates the semantic priors into the super-resolution network, enabling the network to more adeptly capture and utilize semantic priors, thereby enhancing image details. To further explore both local and non-local interactions for improved detail rendition,we propose a Global-Local Collaborative Module, which features three Global and Local Detail Enhancement Modules, as well as a Hybrid Attention Mechanism to work together to efficiently learn more useful features. Our extensive experiments show that SGGLC-Net achieves competitive PSNR and SSIM values across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating higher performance with the multi-adds reduction of 12.81G compared to state-of-the-art lightweight super-resolution approaches. These improvements underscore the potential of our approach to enhance the precision and effectiveness of visual measurement systems. Codes are at https://github.com/fanamber831/SGGLC-Net.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as mainstream framework in visual generation. Building upon this success, the integration of Mixture of Experts (MoE) methods has shown promise in enhancing model scalability and performance. In this paper, we introduce Race-DiT, a novel MoE model for diffusion transformers with a flexible routing strategy, Expert Race. By allowing tokens and experts to compete together and select the top candidates, the model learns to dynamically assign experts to critical tokens. Additionally, we propose per-layer regularization to address challenges in shallow layer learning, and router similarity loss to prevent mode collapse, ensuring better expert utilization. Extensive experiments on ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant performance gains while promising scaling properties.

- **Summary**: Landmark detection plays a crucial role in medical imaging applications such as disease diagnosis, bone age estimation, and therapy planning. However, training models for detecting multiple landmarks simultaneously often encounters the "seesaw phenomenon", where improvements in detecting certain landmarks lead to declines in detecting others. Yet, training a separate model for each landmark increases memory usage and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach based on the belief that "landmarks are distinct" by training models with pseudo-labels and template data updated continuously during the training process, where each model is dedicated to detecting a single landmark to achieve high accuracy. Furthermore, grounded on the belief that "landmarks are also alike", we introduce an adapter-based fusion model, combining shared weights with landmark-specific weights, to efficiently share model parameters while allowing flexible adaptation to individual landmarks. This approach not only significantly reduces memory and computational resource requirements but also effectively mitigates the seesaw phenomenon in multi-landmark training. Experimental results on publicly available medical image datasets demonstrate that the single-landmark models significantly outperform traditional multi-point joint training models in detecting individual landmarks. Although our adapter-based fusion model shows slightly lower performance compared to the combined results of all single-landmark models, it still surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods while achieving a notable improvement in resource efficiency.

- **Summary**: Cross-modal hashing is a promising approach for efficient data retrieval and storage optimization. However, contemporary methods exhibit significant limitations in semantic preservation, contextual integrity, and information redundancy, which constrains retrieval efficacy. We present PromptHash, an innovative framework leveraging affinity prompt-aware collaborative learning for adaptive cross-modal hashing. We propose an end-to-end framework for affinity-prompted collaborative hashing, with the following fundamental technical contributions: (i) a text affinity prompt learning mechanism that preserves contextual information while maintaining parameter efficiency, (ii) an adaptive gated selection fusion architecture that synthesizes State Space Model with Transformer network for precise cross-modal feature integration, and (iii) a prompt affinity alignment strategy that bridges modal heterogeneity through hierarchical contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first investigation into affinity prompt awareness within collaborative cross-modal adaptive hash learning, establishing a paradigm for enhanced semantic consistency across modalities. Through comprehensive evaluation on three benchmark multi-label datasets, PromptHash demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing approaches. Notably, on the NUS-WIDE dataset, our method achieves significant gains of 18.22% and 18.65% in image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks, respectively.

- **Summary**: While virtual try-on for clothes and shoes with diffusion models has gained attraction, virtual try-on for ornaments, such as bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces, remains largely unexplored. Due to the intricate tiny patterns and repeated geometric sub-structures in most ornaments, it is much more difficult to guarantee identity and appearance consistency under large pose and scale variances between ornaments and models. This paper proposes the task of virtual try-on for ornaments and presents a method to improve the geometric and appearance preservation of ornament virtual try-ons. Specifically, we estimate an accurate wearing mask to improve the alignments between ornaments and models in an iterative scheme alongside the denoising process. To preserve structure details, we further regularize attention layers to map the reference ornament mask to the wearing mask in an implicit way. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully wears ornaments from reference images onto target models, handling substantial differences in scale and pose while preserving identity and achieving realistic visual effects.

- **Summary**: Bokeh rendering methods play a key role in creating the visually appealing, softly blurred backgrounds seen in professional photography. While recent learning-based approaches show promising results, generating realistic Bokeh with variable strength remains challenging. Existing methods require additional inputs and suffer from unrealistic Bokeh reproduction due to reliance on synthetic data. In this work, we propose Bokehlicious, a highly efficient network that provides intuitive control over Bokeh strength through an Aperture-Aware Attention mechanism, mimicking the physical lens aperture. To further address the lack of high-quality real-world data, we present RealBokeh, a novel dataset featuring 23,000 high-resolution (24-MP) images captured by professional photographers, covering diverse scenes with varied aperture and focal length settings. Evaluations on both our new RealBokeh and established Bokeh rendering benchmarks show that Bokehlicious consistently outperforms SOTA methods while significantly reducing computational cost and exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization. Our method and dataset further extend to defocus deblurring, achieving competitive results on the RealDOF benchmark. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/TimSeizinger/Bokehlicious

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in trajectory-guided video generation have achieved notable progress. However, existing models still face challenges in generating object motions with potentially changing 6D poses under wide-range rotations, due to limited 3D understanding. To address this problem, we introduce PoseTraj, a pose-aware video dragging model for generating 3D-aligned motion from 2D trajectories. Our method adopts a novel two-stage pose-aware pretraining framework, improving 3D understanding across diverse trajectories. Specifically, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset PoseTraj-10K, containing 10k videos of objects following rotational trajectories, and enhance the model perception of object pose changes by incorporating 3D bounding boxes as intermediate supervision signals. Following this, we fine-tune the trajectory-controlling module on real-world videos, applying an additional camera-disentanglement module to further refine motion accuracy. Experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only excels in 3D pose-aligned dragging for rotational trajectories but also outperforms existing baselines in trajectory accuracy and video quality.

- **Summary**: To improve the prediction of cancer survival using whole-slide images and transcriptomics data, it is crucial to capture both modality-shared and modality-specific information. However, multimodal frameworks often entangle these representations, limiting interpretability and potentially suppressing discriminative features. To address this, we propose Disentangled and Interpretable Multimodal Attention Fusion (DIMAF), a multimodal framework that separates the intra- and inter-modal interactions within an attention-based fusion mechanism to learn distinct modality-specific and modality-shared representations. We introduce a loss based on Distance Correlation to promote disentanglement between these representations and integrate Shapley additive explanations to assess their relative contributions to survival prediction. We evaluate DIMAF on four public cancer survival datasets, achieving a relative average improvement of 1.85% in performance and 23.7% in disentanglement compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal models. Beyond improved performance, our interpretable framework enables a deeper exploration of the underlying interactions between and within modalities in cancer biology.

- **Summary**: Lightsheet microscopy is a powerful 3-D imaging technique that addresses limitations of traditional optical and confocal microscopy but suffers from a low penetration depth and reduced image quality at greater depths. Multiview lightsheet microscopy improves 3-D resolution by combining multiple views but simultaneously increasing the complexity and the photon budget, leading to potential photobleaching and phototoxicity. The FuseMyCells challenge, organized in conjunction with the IEEE ISBI 2025 conference, aims to benchmark deep learning-based solutions for fusing high-quality 3-D volumes from single 3-D views, potentially simplifying procedures and conserving the photon budget. In this work, we propose a contribution to the FuseMyCells challenge based on a two-step procedure. The first step processes a downsampled version of the image to capture the entire region of interest, while the second step uses a patch-based approach for high-resolution inference, incorporating adversarial loss to enhance visual outcomes. This method addresses challenges related to high data resolution, the necessity of global context, and the preservation of high-frequency details. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to improve 3-D image fusion quality and extend the capabilities of lightsheet microscopy. The average SSIM for the nucleus and membranes is greater than 0.85 and 0.91, respectively.

- **Summary**: Ensuring food safety and quality is critical in the food processing industry, where the detection of contaminants remains a persistent challenge. This study presents an automated solution for detecting foreign objects on pork belly meat using hyperspectral imaging (HSI). A hyperspectral camera was used to capture data across various bands in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum (900-1700 nm), enabling accurate identification of contaminants that are often undetectable through traditional visual inspection methods. The proposed solution combines pre-processing techniques with a segmentation approach based on a lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT) to distinguish contaminants from meat, fat, and conveyor belt materials. The adopted strategy demonstrates high detection accuracy and training efficiency, while also addressing key industrial challenges such as inherent noise, temperature variations, and spectral similarity between contaminants and pork belly. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of hyperspectral imaging in enhancing food safety, highlighting its potential for broad real-time applications in automated quality control processes.

- **Summary**: The automated analysis of chemical literature holds promise to accelerate discovery in fields such as material science and drug development. In particular, search capabilities for chemical structures and Markush structures (chemical structure templates) within patent documents are valuable, e.g., for prior-art search. Advancements have been made in the automatic extraction of chemical structures from text and images, yet the Markush structures remain largely unexplored due to their complex multi-modal nature. In this work, we present MarkushGrapher, a multi-modal approach for recognizing Markush structures in documents. Our method jointly encodes text, image, and layout information through a Vision-Text-Layout encoder and an Optical Chemical Structure Recognition vision encoder. These representations are merged and used to auto-regressively generate a sequential graph representation of the Markush structure along with a table defining its variable groups. To overcome the lack of real-world training data, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that produces a wide range of realistic Markush structures. Additionally, we present M2S, the first annotated benchmark of real-world Markush structures, to advance research on this challenging task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art chemistry-specific and general-purpose vision-language models in most evaluation settings. Code, models, and datasets will be available.

- **Summary**: We introduce Low-Shot Open-Set Domain Generalization (LSOSDG), a novel paradigm unifying low-shot learning with open-set domain generalization (ODG). While prompt-based methods using models like CLIP have advanced DG, they falter in low-data regimes (e.g., 1-shot) and lack precision in detecting open-set samples with fine-grained semantics related to training classes. To address these challenges, we propose OSLOPROMPT, an advanced prompt-learning framework for CLIP with two core innovations. First, to manage limited supervision across source domains and improve DG, we introduce a domain-agnostic prompt-learning mechanism that integrates adaptable domain-specific cues and visually guided semantic attributes through a novel cross-attention module, besides being supported by learnable domain- and class-generic visual prompts to enhance cross-modal adaptability. Second, to improve outlier rejection during inference, we classify unfamiliar samples as "unknown" and train specialized prompts with systematically synthesized pseudo-open samples that maintain fine-grained relationships to known classes, generated through a targeted query strategy with off-the-shelf foundation models. This strategy enhances feature learning, enabling our model to detect open samples with varied granularity more effectively. Extensive evaluations across five benchmarks demonstrate that OSLOPROMPT establishes a new state-of-the-art in LSOSDG, significantly outperforming existing methods.

- **Summary**: Multi-species animal pose estimation has emerged as a challenging yet critical task, hindered by substantial visual diversity and uncertainty. This paper challenges the problem by efficient prompt learning for Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models, \textit{e.g.} CLIP, aiming to resolve the cross-species generalization problem. At the core of the solution lies in the prompt designing, probabilistic prompt modeling and cross-modal adaptation, thereby enabling prompts to compensate for cross-modal information and effectively overcome large data variances under unbalanced data distribution. To this end, we propose a novel probabilistic prompting approach to fully explore textual descriptions, which could alleviate the diversity issues caused by long-tail property and increase the adaptability of prompts on unseen category instance. Specifically, we first introduce a set of learnable prompts and propose a diversity loss to maintain distinctiveness among prompts, thus representing diverse image attributes. Diverse textual probabilistic representations are sampled and used as the guidance for the pose estimation. Subsequently, we explore three different cross-modal fusion strategies at spatial level to alleviate the adverse impacts of visual uncertainty. Extensive experiments on multi-species animal pose benchmarks show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance under both supervised and zero-shot settings.

- **Summary**: Active learning has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the substantial annotation burden in 3D object detection tasks, spurring several initiatives in outdoor environments. However, its application in indoor environments remains unexplored. Compared to outdoor 3D datasets, indoor datasets face significant challenges, including fewer training samples per class, a greater number of classes, more severe class imbalance, and more diverse scene types and intra-class variances. This paper presents the first study on active learning for indoor 3D object detection, where we propose a novel framework tailored for this task. Our method incorporates two key criteria - uncertainty and diversity - to actively select the most ambiguous and informative unlabeled samples for annotation. The uncertainty criterion accounts for both inaccurate detections and undetected objects, ensuring that the most ambiguous samples are prioritized. Meanwhile, the diversity criterion is formulated as a joint optimization problem that maximizes the diversity of both object class distributions and scene types, using a new Class-aware Adaptive Prototype (CAP) bank. The CAP bank dynamically allocates representative prototypes to each class, helping to capture varying intra-class diversity across different categories. We evaluate our method on SUN RGB-D and ScanNetV2, where it outperforms baselines by a significant margin, achieving over 85% of fully-supervised performance with just 10% of the annotation budget.

- **Summary**: Assessing smile genuineness from video sequences is a vital topic concerned with recognizing facial expression and linking them with the underlying emotional states. There have been a number of techniques proposed underpinned with handcrafted features, as well as those that rely on deep learning to elaborate the useful features. As both of these approaches have certain benefits and limitations, in this work we propose to combine the features learned by a long short-term memory network with the features handcrafted to capture the dynamics of facial action units. The results of our experiments indicate that the proposed solution is more effective than the baseline techniques and it allows for assessing the smile genuineness from video sequences in real-time.

- **Summary**: Quad Bayer demosaicing is the central challenge for enabling the widespread application of Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensors (HybridEVS). Although existing learning-based methods that leverage long-range dependency modeling have achieved promising results, their complexity severely limits deployment on mobile devices for real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight Mamba-based binary neural network designed for efficient and high-performing demosaicing of HybridEVS RAW images. First, to effectively capture both global and local dependencies, we introduce a hybrid Binarized Mamba-Transformer architecture that combines the strengths of the Mamba and Swin Transformer architectures. Next, to significantly reduce computational complexity, we propose a binarized Mamba (Bi-Mamba), which binarizes all projections while retaining the core Selective Scan in full precision. Bi-Mamba also incorporates additional global visual information to enhance global context and mitigate precision loss. We conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of BMTNet in both performance and computational efficiency, providing a lightweight demosaicing solution suited for real-world edge devices.

- **Summary**: Efficient modal feature fusion strategy is the key to achieve accurate segmentation of brain glioma. However, due to the specificity of different MRI modes, it is difficult to carry out cross-modal fusion with large differences in modal features, resulting in the model ignoring rich feature information. On the other hand, the problem of multi-modal feature redundancy interaction occurs in parallel networks due to the proliferation of feature dimensions, further increase the difficulty of multi-modal feature fusion at the bottom end. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a noval complementary feature compression interaction network (CFCI-Net), which realizes the complementary fusion and compression interaction of multi-modal feature information with an efficient mode fusion strategy. Firstly, we propose a selective complementary feature fusion (SCFF) module, which adaptively fuses rich cross-modal feature information by complementary soft selection weights. Secondly, a modal feature compression interaction (MFCI) transformer is proposed to deal with the multi-mode fusion redundancy problem when the feature dimension surges. The MFCI transformer is composed of modal feature compression (MFC) and modal feature interaction (MFI) to realize redundancy feature compression and multi-mode feature interactive learning. %In MFI, we propose a hierarchical interactive attention mechanism based on multi-head attention. Evaluations on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate that CFCI-Net achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art models. Code: https://github.com/CDmm0/CFCI-Net

- **Summary**: The integration of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) has significantly enhanced text-to-image generation quality. However, the fundamental reliance of self-attention layers on positional embedding versus query-key similarity during generation remains an intriguing question. We present the first mechanistic analysis of RoPE-based MMDiT models (e.g., FLUX), introducing an automated probing strategy that disentangles positional information versus content dependencies by strategically manipulating RoPE during generation. Our analysis reveals distinct dependency patterns that do not straightforwardly correlate with depth, offering new insights into the layer-specific roles in RoPE-based MMDiT. Based on these findings, we propose a training-free, task-specific image editing framework that categorizes editing tasks into three types: position-dependent editing (e.g., object addition), content similarity-dependent editing (e.g., non-rigid editing), and region-preserved editing (e.g., background replacement). For each type, we design tailored key-value injection strategies based on the characteristics of the editing task. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in preserving original semantic content and achieving seamless modifications.

- **Summary**: High-fidelity imaging is crucial for the successful safety supervision and intelligent deployment of vision-based measurement systems (VBMS). It ensures high-quality imaging in VBMS, which is fundamental for reliable visual measurement and analysis. However, imaging quality can be significantly impaired by adverse weather conditions, particularly rain, leading to blurred images and reduced contrast. Such impairments increase the risk of inaccurate evaluations and misinterpretations in VBMS. To address these limitations, we propose an Expectation Maximization Reconstruction Transformer (EMResformer) for single image rain streak removal. The EMResformer retains the key self-attention values for feature aggregation, enhancing local features to produce superior image reconstruction. Specifically, we propose an Expectation Maximization Block seamlessly integrated into the single image rain streak removal network, enhancing its ability to eliminate superfluous information and restore a cleaner background image. Additionally, to further enhance local information for improved detail rendition, we introduce a Local Model Residual Block, which integrates two local model blocks along with a sequence of convolutions and activation functions. This integration synergistically facilitates the extraction of more pertinent features for enhanced single image rain streak removal. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed EMResformer surpasses current state-of-the-art single image rain streak removal methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, achieving an improved balance between model complexity and single image deraining performance. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method in VBMS scenarios, demonstrating that high-quality imaging significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of VBMS tasks.

- **Summary**: In large-scale scene reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting, it is common to partition the scene into multiple smaller regions and reconstruct them individually. However, existing division methods are occlusion-agnostic, meaning that each region may contain areas with severe occlusions. As a result, the cameras within those regions are less correlated, leading to a low average contribution to the overall reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an occlusion-aware scene division strategy that clusters training cameras based on their positions and co-visibilities to acquire multiple regions. Cameras in such regions exhibit stronger correlations and a higher average contribution, facilitating high-quality scene reconstruction. We further propose a region-based rendering technique to accelerate large scene rendering, which culls Gaussians invisible to the region where the viewpoint is located. Such a technique significantly speeds up the rendering without compromising quality. Extensive experiments on multiple large scenes show that our method achieves superior reconstruction results with faster rendering speed compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Efforts to address declining accuracy as a result of data shifts often involve various data-augmentation strategies. Adversarial training is one such method, designed to improve robustness to worst-case distribution shifts caused by adversarial examples. While this method can improve robustness, it may also hinder generalization to clean examples and exacerbate performance imbalances across different classes. This paper explores the impact of adversarial training on both overall and class-specific performance, as well as its spill-over effects. We observe that enhanced labeling during training boosts adversarial robustness by 53.50% and mitigates class imbalances by 5.73%, leading to improved accuracy in both clean and adversarial settings compared to standard adversarial training.

- **Summary**: Scaling architectures have been proven effective for improving Scene Text Recognition (STR), but the individual contribution of vision encoder and text decoder scaling remain under-explored. In this work, we present an in-depth empirical analysis and demonstrate that, contrary to previous observations, scaling the decoder yields significant performance gains, always exceeding those achieved by encoder scaling alone. We also identify label noise as a key challenge in STR, particularly in real-world data, which can limit the effectiveness of STR models. To address this, we propose Cloze Self-Distillation (CSD), a method that mitigates label noise by distilling a student model from context-aware soft predictions and pseudolabels generated by a teacher model. Additionally, we enhance the decoder architecture by introducing differential cross-attention for STR. Our methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 11 benchmarks using only real data, while significantly reducing the parameter size and computational costs.

- **Summary**: Multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI) matching is pivotal for cross-modal fusion, localization, and object detection, but it faces severe challenges due to geometric, radiometric, and viewpoint discrepancies across imaging modalities. Existing unimodal datasets lack scale and diversity, limiting deep learning solutions. This paper proposes MapGlue, a universal MRSI matching framework, and MapData, a large-scale multimodal dataset addressing these gaps. Our contributions are twofold. MapData, a globally diverse dataset spanning 233 sampling points, offers original images (7,000x5,000 to 20,000x15,000 pixels). After rigorous cleaning, it provides 121,781 aligned electronic map-visible image pairs (512x512 pixels) with hybrid manual-automated ground truth, addressing the scarcity of scalable multimodal benchmarks. MapGlue integrates semantic context with a dual graph-guided mechanism to extract cross-modal invariant features. This structure enables global-to-local interaction, enhancing descriptor robustness against modality-specific distortions. Extensive evaluations on MapData and five public datasets demonstrate MapGlue's superiority in matching accuracy under complex conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MapGlue generalizes effectively to unseen modalities without retraining, highlighting its adaptability. This work addresses longstanding challenges in MRSI matching by combining scalable dataset construction with a robust, semantics-driven framework. Furthermore, MapGlue shows strong generalization capabilities on other modality matching tasks for which it was not specifically trained. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/PeihaoWu/MapGlue.

- **Summary**: Classification is a core task in machine learning. Recent research has shown that although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are initially poor at image classification, fine-tuning them with an adequate amount of data can significantly enhance their performance, making them comparable to SOTA classification models. However, acquiring large-scale labeled data is expensive. In this paper, we explore few-shot MLLM classification fine-tuning. We found that SFT can cause severe overfitting issues and may even degrade performance over the zero-shot approach. To address this challenge, inspired by the recent successes in rule-based reinforcement learning, we propose CLS-RL, which uses verifiable signals as reward to fine-tune MLLMs. We discovered that CLS-RL outperforms SFT in most datasets and has a much higher average accuracy on both base-to-new and few-shot learning setting. Moreover, we observed a free-lunch phenomenon for CLS-RL; when models are fine-tuned on a particular dataset, their performance on other distinct datasets may also improve over zero-shot models, even if those datasets differ in distribution and class names. This suggests that RL-based methods effectively teach models the fundamentals of classification. Lastly, inspired by recent works in inference time thinking, we re-examine the `thinking process' during fine-tuning, a critical aspect of RL-based methods, in the context of visual classification. We question whether such tasks require extensive thinking process during fine-tuning, proposing that this may actually detract from performance. Based on this premise, we introduce the No-Thinking-CLS-RL method, which minimizes thinking processes during training by setting an equality accuracy reward. Our findings indicate that, with much less fine-tuning time, No-Thinking-CLS-RL method achieves superior in-domain performance and generalization capabilities than CLS-RL.

- **Summary**: Autoregressive models have shown remarkable success in image generation by adapting sequential prediction techniques from language modeling. However, applying these approaches to images requires discretizing continuous pixel data through vector quantization methods like VQ-VAE. To alleviate the quantization errors that existed in VQ-VAE, recent works tend to use larger codebooks. However, this will accordingly expand vocabulary size, complicating the autoregressive modeling task. This paper aims to find a way to enjoy the benefits of large codebooks without making autoregressive modeling more difficult. Through empirical investigation, we discover that tokens with similar codeword representations produce similar effects on the final generated image, revealing significant redundancy in large codebooks. Based on this insight, we propose to predict tokens from coarse to fine (CTF), realized by assigning the same coarse label for similar tokens. Our framework consists of two stages: (1) an autoregressive model that sequentially predicts coarse labels for each token in the sequence, and (2) an auxiliary model that simultaneously predicts fine-grained labels for all tokens conditioned on their coarse labels. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate our method's superior performance, achieving an average improvement of 59 points in Inception Score compared to baselines. Notably, despite adding an inference step, our approach achieves faster sampling speeds.

- **Summary**: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data has become the de facto standard for releasing sensitive data. However, many DP generative models suffer from the low utility of synthetic data, especially for high-resolution images. On the other hand, one of the emerging techniques in parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is visual prompting (VP), which allows well-trained existing models to be reused for the purpose of adapting to subsequent downstream tasks. In this work, we explore such a phenomenon in constructing captivating generative models with DP constraints. We show that VP in conjunction with DP-NTK, a DP generator that exploits the power of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) in training DP generative models, achieves a significant performance boost, particularly for high-resolution image datasets, with accuracy improving from 0.644$\pm$0.044 to 0.769. Lastly, we perform ablation studies on the effect of different parameters that influence the overall performance of VP-NTK. Our work demonstrates a promising step forward in improving the utility of DP synthetic data, particularly for high-resolution images.

- **Summary**: Visual artifacts remain a persistent challenge in diffusion models, even with training on massive datasets. Current solutions primarily rely on supervised detectors, yet lack understanding of why these artifacts occur in the first place. In our analysis, we identify three distinct phases in the diffusion generative process: Profiling, Mutation, and Refinement. Artifacts typically emerge during the Mutation phase, where certain regions exhibit anomalous score dynamics over time, causing abrupt disruptions in the normal evolution pattern. This temporal nature explains why existing methods focusing only on spatial uncertainty of the final output fail at effective artifact localization. Based on these insights, we propose ASCED (Abnormal Score Correction for Enhancing Diffusion), that detects artifacts by monitoring abnormal score dynamics during the diffusion process, with a trajectory-aware on-the-fly mitigation strategy that appropriate generation of noise in the detected areas. Unlike most existing methods that apply post hoc corrections, \eg, by applying a noising-denoising scheme after generation, our mitigation strategy operates seamlessly within the existing diffusion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively reduces artifacts across diverse domains, matching or surpassing existing supervised methods without additional training.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play (PnP) Langevin sampling methodology for Bayesian inference in low-photon Poisson imaging problems, a challenging class of problems with significant applications in astronomy, medicine, and biology. PnP Langevin sampling algorithms offer a powerful framework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as well as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and visualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model parameter tuning. However, existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited for low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor regularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two strategies for extending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated PnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson likelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a Riemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the likelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The growing reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical domains such as healthcare demands robust mechanisms to ensure the trustworthiness of these systems, especially when faced with unexpected or anomalous inputs. This paper introduces the Open Medical Imaging Benchmarks for Out-Of-Distribution Detection (OpenMIBOOD), a comprehensive framework for evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods specifically in medical imaging contexts. OpenMIBOOD includes three benchmarks from diverse medical domains, encompassing 14 datasets divided into covariate-shifted in-distribution, near-OOD, and far-OOD categories. We evaluate 24 post-hoc methods across these benchmarks, providing a standardized reference to advance the development and fair comparison of OOD detection methods. Results reveal that findings from broad-scale OOD benchmarks in natural image domains do not translate to medical applications, underscoring the critical need for such benchmarks in the medical field. By mitigating the risk of exposing AI models to inputs outside their training distribution, OpenMIBOOD aims to support the advancement of reliable and trustworthy AI systems in healthcare.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) increasingly rely on Federated Learning (FL) to enhance perception models while preserving privacy. However, existing FL frameworks struggle to balance privacy, fairness, and robustness, leading to performance disparities across demographic groups. Privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy mitigate data leakage risks but worsen fairness by restricting access to sensitive attributes needed for bias correction. This work explores the trade-off between privacy and fairness in FL-based object detection for AVs and introduces RESFL, an integrated solution optimizing both. RESFL incorporates adversarial privacy disentanglement and uncertainty-guided fairness-aware aggregation. The adversarial component uses a gradient reversal layer to remove sensitive attributes, reducing privacy risks while maintaining fairness. The uncertainty-aware aggregation employs an evidential neural network to weight client updates adaptively, prioritizing contributions with lower fairness disparities and higher confidence. This ensures robust and equitable FL model updates. We evaluate RESFL on the FACET dataset and CARLA simulator, assessing accuracy, fairness, privacy resilience, and robustness under varying conditions. RESFL improves detection accuracy, reduces fairness disparities, and lowers privacy attack success rates while demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial conditions compared to other approaches.

- **Summary**: We present Markov Map Nearest Neighbor V2 (M2N2V2), a novel and simple, yet effective approach which leverages depth guidance and attention maps for unsupervised and training-free point-prompt-based interactive segmentation. Following recent trends in supervised multimodal approaches, we carefully integrate depth as an additional modality to create novel depth-guided Markov-maps. Furthermore, we observe occasional segment size fluctuations in M2N2 during the interactive process, which can decrease the overall mIoU's. To mitigate this problem, we model the prompting as a sequential process and propose a novel adaptive score function which considers the previous segmentation and the current prompt point in order to prevent unreasonable segment size changes. Using Stable Diffusion 2 and Depth Anything V2 as backbones, we empirically show that our proposed M2N2V2 significantly improves the Number of Clicks (NoC) and mIoU compared to M2N2 in all datasets except those from the medical domain. Interestingly, our unsupervised approach achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods like SAM and SimpleClick in the more challenging DAVIS and HQSeg44K datasets in the NoC metric, reducing the gap between supervised and unsupervised methods.

- **Summary**: Video large language models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated the capability to process longer video inputs and enable complex reasoning and analysis. However, due to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, key-value (KV) cache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for inference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used approach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV quantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the limit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To bridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization method to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits. Specifically, (1) for key, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy in the channel dimension, where we perform 2-bit quantization for anomalous channels and 1-bit quantization combined with FFT for normal channels; (2) for value, we implement 1.58-bit quantization while selectively filtering semantically salient visual tokens for targeted preservation, for a better trade-off between precision and model performance. Importantly, our findings suggest that the value cache of VideoLLMs should be quantized in a per-channel fashion instead of the per-token fashion proposed by prior KV cache quantization works for LLMs. Empirically, extensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show that VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit precision with almost no performance drop compared to the FP16 counterparts.

- **Summary**: Visual reasoning is crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to address complex chart queries, yet high-quality rationale data remains scarce. Existing methods leveraged (M)LLMs for data generation, but direct prompting often yields limited precision and diversity. In this paper, we propose \textit{Chain of Functions (CoF)}, a novel programmatic reasoning data generation pipeline that utilizes freely-explored reasoning paths as supervision to ensure data precision and diversity. Specifically, it starts with human-free exploration among the atomic functions (e.g., maximum data and arithmetic operations) to generate diverse function chains, which are then translated into linguistic rationales and questions with only a moderate open-sourced LLM. \textit{CoF} provides multiple benefits: 1) Precision: function-governed generation reduces hallucinations compared to freeform generation; 2) Diversity: enumerating function chains enables varied question taxonomies; 3) Explainability: function chains serve as built-in rationales, allowing fine-grained evaluation beyond overall accuracy; 4) Practicality: eliminating reliance on extremely large models. Employing \textit{CoF}, we construct the \textit{ChartCoF} dataset, with 1.4k complex reasoning Q\&A for fine-grained analysis and 50k Q\&A for reasoning enhancement. The fine-grained evaluation on \textit{ChartCoF} reveals varying performance across question taxonomies for each MLLM, and the experiments also show that finetuning with \textit{ChartCoF} achieves state-of-the-art performance among same-scale MLLMs on widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, the novel paradigm of function-governed rationale generation in \textit{CoF} could inspire broader applications beyond charts.

- **Summary**: Surgical automation requires precise guidance and understanding of the scene. Current methods in the literature rely on bulky depth cameras to create maps of the anatomy, however this does not translate well to space-limited clinical applications. Monocular cameras are small and allow minimally invasive surgeries in tight spaces but additional processing is required to generate 3D scene understanding. We propose a 3D mapping pipeline that uses only RGB images to create segmented point clouds of the target anatomy. To ensure the most precise reconstruction, we compare different structure from motion algorithms' performance on mapping the central airway obstructions, and test the pipeline on a downstream task of tumor resection. In several metrics, including post-procedure tissue model evaluation, our pipeline performs comparably to RGB-D cameras and, in some cases, even surpasses their performance. These promising results demonstrate that automation guidance can be achieved in minimally invasive procedures with monocular cameras. This study is a step toward the complete autonomy of surgical robots.

- **Summary**: Image and video quality metrics, such as SSIM, LPIPS, and VMAF, are aimed to predict the perceived quality of the evaluated content and are often claimed to be "perceptual". Yet, few metrics directly model human visual perception, and most rely on hand-crafted formulas or training datasets to achieve alignment with perceptual data. In this paper, we propose a set of tests for full-reference quality metrics that examine their ability to model several aspects of low-level human vision: contrast sensitivity, contrast masking, and contrast matching. The tests are meant to provide additional scrutiny for newly proposed metrics. We use our tests to analyze 33 existing image and video quality metrics and find their strengths and weaknesses, such as the ability of LPIPS and MS-SSIM to predict contrast masking and poor performance of VMAF in this task. We further find that the popular SSIM metric overemphasizes differences in high spatial frequencies, but its multi-scale counterpart, MS-SSIM, addresses this shortcoming. Such findings cannot be easily made using existing evaluation protocols.

- **Summary**: Generalized few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation (GFS-PCS) adapts models to new classes with few support samples while retaining base class segmentation. Existing GFS-PCS methods enhance prototypes via interacting with support or query features but remain limited by sparse knowledge from few-shot samples. Meanwhile, 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs), generalizing across open-world novel classes, contain rich but noisy novel class knowledge. In this work, we introduce a GFS-PCS framework that synergizes dense but noisy pseudo-labels from 3D VLMs with precise yet sparse few-shot samples to maximize the strengths of both, named GFS-VL. Specifically, we present a prototype-guided pseudo-label selection to filter low-quality regions, followed by an adaptive infilling strategy that combines knowledge from pseudo-label contexts and few-shot samples to adaptively label the filtered, unlabeled areas. Additionally, we design a novel-base mix strategy to embed few-shot samples into training scenes, preserving essential context for improved novel class learning. Moreover, recognizing the limited diversity in current GFS-PCS benchmarks, we introduce two challenging benchmarks with diverse novel classes for comprehensive generalization evaluation. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework across models and datasets. Our approach and benchmarks provide a solid foundation for advancing GFS-PCS in the real world.

- **Summary**: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are high-resolution digital scans widely used in medical diagnostics. WSI classification is typically approached using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), where the slide is partitioned into tiles treated as interconnected instances. While attention-based MIL methods aim to identify the most informative tiles, they often fail to fully exploit the spatial relationships among them, potentially overlooking intricate tissue structures crucial for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose Probabilistic Spatial Attention MIL (PSA-MIL), a novel attention-based MIL framework that integrates spatial context into the attention mechanism through learnable distance-decayed priors, formulated within a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention as a posterior distribution. This formulation enables a dynamic inference of spatial relationships during training, eliminating the need for predefined assumptions often imposed by previous approaches. Additionally, we suggest a spatial pruning strategy for the posterior, effectively reducing self-attention's quadratic complexity. To further enhance spatial modeling, we introduce a diversity loss that encourages variation among attention heads, ensuring each captures distinct spatial representations. Together, PSA-MIL enables a more data-driven and adaptive integration of spatial context, moving beyond predefined constraints. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across both contextual and non-contextual baselines, while significantly reducing computational costs.

- **Summary**: Modeling human-scene interactions (HSI) is essential for understanding and simulating everyday human behaviors. Recent approaches utilizing generative modeling have made progress in this domain; however, they are limited in controllability and flexibility for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose reformulating the HSI modeling problem as Scene-aware Motion In-betweening -- a more tractable and practical task. We introduce SceneMI, a framework that supports several practical applications, including keyframe-guided character animation in 3D scenes and enhancing the motion quality of imperfect HSI data. SceneMI employs dual scene descriptors to comprehensively encode global and local scene context. Furthermore, our framework leverages the inherent denoising nature of diffusion models to generalize on noisy keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate SceneMI's effectiveness in scene-aware keyframe in-betweening and generalization to the real-world GIMO dataset, where motions and scenes are acquired by noisy IMU sensors and smartphones. We further showcase SceneMI's applicability in HSI reconstruction from monocular videos.

- **Summary**: 3D shape generation has greatly flourished through the development of so-called "native" 3D diffusion, particularly through the Vecset Diffusion Model (VDM). While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation.

- **Summary**: The integration of artificial intelligence in image-guided interventions holds transformative potential, promising to extract 3D geometric and quantitative information from conventional 2D imaging modalities during complex procedures. Achieving this requires the rapid and precise alignment of 2D intraoperative images (e.g., X-ray) with 3D preoperative volumes (e.g., CT, MRI). However, current 2D/3D registration methods fail across the broad spectrum of procedures dependent on X-ray guidance: traditional optimization techniques require custom parameter tuning for each subject, whereas neural networks trained on small datasets do not generalize to new patients or require labor-intensive manual annotations, increasing clinical burden and precluding application to new anatomical targets. To address these challenges, we present xvr, a fully automated framework for training patient-specific neural networks for 2D/3D registration. xvr uses physics-based simulation to generate abundant high-quality training data from a patient's own preoperative volumetric imaging, thereby overcoming the inherently limited ability of supervised models to generalize to new patients and procedures. Furthermore, xvr requires only 5 minutes of training per patient, making it suitable for emergency interventions as well as planned procedures. We perform the largest evaluation of a 2D/3D registration algorithm on real X-ray data to date and find that xvr robustly generalizes across a diverse dataset comprising multiple anatomical structures, imaging modalities, and hospitals. Across surgical tasks, xvr achieves submillimeter-accurate registration at intraoperative speeds, improving upon existing methods by an order of magnitude. xvr is released as open-source software freely available at https://github.com/eigenvivek/xvr.

- **Summary**: DUSt3R has recently shown that one can reduce many tasks in multi-view geometry, including estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics, reconstructing the scene in 3D, and establishing image correspondences, to the prediction of a pair of viewpoint-invariant point maps, i.e., pixel-aligned point clouds defined in a common reference frame. This formulation is elegant and powerful, but unable to tackle dynamic scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Dynamic Point Maps (DPM), extending standard point maps to support 4D tasks such as motion segmentation, scene flow estimation, 3D object tracking, and 2D correspondence. Our key intuition is that, when time is introduced, there are several possible spatial and time references that can be used to define the point maps. We identify a minimal subset of such combinations that can be regressed by a network to solve the sub tasks mentioned above. We train a DPM predictor on a mixture of synthetic and real data and evaluate it across diverse benchmarks for video depth prediction, dynamic point cloud reconstruction, 3D scene flow and object pose tracking, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code, models and additional results are available at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/dynamic-point-maps/.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, training models for high-resolution image generation remains challenging, particularly when training data and computational resources are limited. In this paper, we explore this practical problem from two key perspectives: data and parameter efficiency, and propose a set of key guidelines for ultra-resolution adaptation termed \emph{URAE}. For data efficiency, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that synthetic data generated by some teacher models can significantly promote training convergence. For parameter efficiency, we find that tuning minor components of the weight matrices outperforms widely-used low-rank adapters when synthetic data are unavailable, offering substantial performance gains while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, for models leveraging guidance distillation, such as FLUX, we show that disabling classifier-free guidance, \textit{i.e.}, setting the guidance scale to 1 during adaptation, is crucial for satisfactory performance. Extensive experiments validate that URAE achieves comparable 2K-generation performance to state-of-the-art closed-source models like FLUX1.1 [Pro] Ultra with only 3K samples and 2K iterations, while setting new benchmarks for 4K-resolution generation.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis performance. While conventional methods require per-scene optimization, more recently several feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate pixel-aligned Gaussian representations with a learnable network, which are generalizable to different scenes. However, these methods simply combine pixel-aligned Gaussians from multiple views as scene representations, thereby leading to artifacts and extra memory cost without fully capturing the relations of Gaussians from different images. In this paper, we propose Gaussian Graph Network (GGN) to generate efficient and generalizable Gaussian representations. Specifically, we construct Gaussian Graphs to model the relations of Gaussian groups from different views. To support message passing at Gaussian level, we reformulate the basic graph operations over Gaussian representations, enabling each Gaussian to benefit from its connected Gaussian groups with Gaussian feature fusion. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian pooling layer to aggregate various Gaussian groups for efficient representations. We conduct experiments on the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our model uses fewer Gaussians and achieves better image quality with higher rendering speed.

- **Summary**: Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.

- **Summary**: Precise audio-visual synchronization in speech videos is crucial for content quality and viewer comprehension. Existing methods have made significant strides in addressing this challenge through rule-based approaches and end-to-end learning techniques. However, these methods often rely on limited audio-visual representations and suboptimal learning strategies, potentially constraining their effectiveness in more complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we present UniSync, a novel approach for evaluating audio-visual synchronization using embedding similarities. UniSync offers broad compatibility with various audio representations (e.g., Mel spectrograms, HuBERT) and visual representations (e.g., RGB images, face parsing maps, facial landmarks, 3DMM), effectively handling their significant dimensional differences. We enhance the contrastive learning framework with a margin-based loss component and cross-speaker unsynchronized pairs, improving discriminative capabilities. UniSync outperforms existing methods on standard datasets and demonstrates versatility across diverse audio-visual representations. Its integration into talking face generation frameworks enhances synchronization quality in both natural and AI-generated content.

- **Summary**: Recently, action-based decision-making in open-world environments has gained significant attention. Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on large-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However, previous work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting enhancements to the foundational model itself. In response, we introduce a novel approach, Act from Visual Language Post-Training, which refines Visual Language Models (VLMs) through visual and linguistic guidance in a self-supervised manner. This enhancement improves the models' capabilities in world knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world environments. Following the above post-training paradigms, we obtain the first VLA models in Minecraft that can follow human instructions on over 1k different atomic tasks, including crafting, smelting, cooking, mining, and killing. Our experiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to a significant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on a diverse set of atomic tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional imitation learning-based policies in Minecraft, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We have open-sourced the code, models, and datasets to foster further research. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/JarvisVLA.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we explore the task of generating expansive outdoor scenes, ranging from castles to high-rises. Unlike indoor scene generation, which has been a primary focus of prior work, outdoor scene generation presents unique challenges, including wide variations in scene heights and the need for a method capable of rapidly producing large landscapes. To address this, we propose an efficient approach that encodes scene chunks as uniform vector sets, offering better compression and performance than the spatially structured latents used in prior methods. Furthermore, we train an explicit outpainting model for unbounded generation, which improves coherence compared to prior resampling-based inpainting schemes while also speeding up generation by eliminating extra diffusion steps. To facilitate this task, we curate NuiScene43, a small but high-quality set of scenes, preprocessed for joint training. Notably, when trained on scenes of varying styles, our model can blend different environments, such as rural houses and city skyscrapers, within the same scene, highlighting the potential of our curation process to leverage heterogeneous scenes for joint training.

- **Summary**: The success of modern machine learning, particularly in facial translation networks, is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality, paired, large-scale datasets. However, acquiring sufficient data is often challenging and costly. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in high-quality image synthesis and advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel framework called LLM-assisted Paired Image Generation (LaPIG). This framework enables the construction of comprehensive, high-quality paired visible and thermal images using captions generated by LLMs. Our method encompasses three parts: visible image synthesis with ArcFace embedding, thermal image translation using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), and caption generation with LLMs. Our approach not only generates multi-view paired visible and thermal images to increase data diversity but also produces high-quality paired data while maintaining their identity information. We evaluate our method on public datasets by comparing it with existing methods, demonstrating the superiority of LaPIG.

- **Summary**: Existing autonomous driving datasets are predominantly oriented towards well-structured urban settings and favorable weather conditions, leaving the complexities of rural environments and adverse weather conditions largely unaddressed. Although some datasets encompass variations in weather and lighting, bad weather scenarios do not appear often. Rainfall can significantly impair sensor functionality, introducing noise and reflections in LiDAR and camera data and reducing the system's capabilities for reliable environmental perception and safe navigation. We introduce the Panoptic-CUDAL dataset, a novel dataset purpose-built for panoptic segmentation in rural areas subject to rain. By recording high-resolution LiDAR, camera, and pose data, Panoptic-CUDAL offers a diverse, information-rich dataset in a challenging scenario. We present analysis of the recorded data and provide baseline results for panoptic and semantic segmentation methods on LiDAR point clouds.

- **Summary**: Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) segmentation is essential for diagnosing pathology. Traditional methods focus on either spatial or spectral domains, overlooking their combined dependencies. We propose a triple-encoder network that integrates CNNs for spatial features, Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) for spectral features, and attention mechanisms to capture global relationships across both domains. Attention fusion modules integrate convolution and cross-attention to further enhance features. Our method achieves an average Dice score improvement from 0.855 to 0.864, outperforming prior work.

- **Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents are tasked with navigating an unseen environment using natural language instructions. In this work, we study if visual representations of sub-goals implied by the instructions can serve as navigational cues and lead to increased navigation performance. To synthesize these visual representations or imaginations, we leverage a text-to-image diffusion model on landmark references contained in segmented instructions. These imaginations are provided to VLN agents as an added modality to act as landmark cues and an auxiliary loss is added to explicitly encourage relating these with their corresponding referring expressions. Our findings reveal an increase in success rate (SR) of around 1 point and up to 0.5 points in success scaled by inverse path length (SPL) across agents. These results suggest that the proposed approach reinforces visual understanding compared to relying on language instructions alone.

- **Summary**: We present Stable Video 4D 2.0 (SV4D 2.0), a multi-view video diffusion model for dynamic 3D asset generation. Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gain by SV4D 2.0 both visually and quantitatively, achieving better detail (-14\% LPIPS) and 4D consistency (-44\% FV4D) in novel-view video synthesis and 4D optimization (-12\% LPIPS and -24\% FV4D) compared to SV4D.

- **Summary**: We present SwD, a scale-wise distillation framework for diffusion models (DMs), which effectively employs next-scale prediction ideas for diffusion-based few-step generators. In more detail, SwD is inspired by the recent insights relating diffusion processes to the implicit spectral autoregression. We suppose that DMs can initiate generation at lower data resolutions and gradually upscale the samples at each denoising step without loss in performance while significantly reducing computational costs. SwD naturally integrates this idea into existing diffusion distillation methods based on distribution matching. Also, we enrich the family of distribution matching approaches by introducing a novel patch loss enforcing finer-grained similarity to the target distribution. When applied to state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models, SwD approaches the inference times of two full resolution steps and significantly outperforms the counterparts under the same computation budget, as evidenced by automated metrics and human preference studies.

- **Summary**: Existing vision-based 3D occupancy prediction methods are inherently limited in accuracy due to their exclusive reliance on street-view imagery, neglecting the potential benefits of incorporating satellite views. We propose SA-Occ, the first Satellite-Assisted 3D occupancy prediction model, which leverages GPS & IMU to integrate historical yet readily available satellite imagery into real-time applications, effectively mitigating limitations of ego-vehicle perceptions, involving occlusions and degraded performance in distant regions. To address the core challenges of cross-view perception, we propose: 1) Dynamic-Decoupling Fusion, which resolves inconsistencies in dynamic regions caused by the temporal asynchrony between satellite and street views; 2) 3D-Proj Guidance, a module that enhances 3D feature extraction from inherently 2D satellite imagery; and 3) Uniform Sampling Alignment, which aligns the sampling density between street and satellite views. Evaluated on Occ3D-nuScenes, SA-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially among single-frame methods, with a 39.05% mIoU (a 6.97% improvement), while incurring only 6.93 ms of additional latency per frame.

- **Summary**: Recent large-scale text-to-image diffusion models generate photorealistic images but often struggle to accurately depict interactions between humans and objects due to their limited ability to differentiate various interaction words. In this work, we propose VerbDiff to address the challenge of capturing nuanced interactions within text-to-image diffusion models. VerbDiff is a novel text-to-image generation model that weakens the bias between interaction words and objects, enhancing the understanding of interactions. Specifically, we disentangle various interaction words from frequency-based anchor words and leverage localized interaction regions from generated images to help the model better capture semantics in distinctive words without extra conditions. Our approach enables the model to accurately understand the intended interaction between humans and objects, producing high-quality images with accurate interactions aligned with specified verbs. Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to previous approaches.

- **Summary**: Designing effective embodied multi-agent systems is critical for solving complex real-world tasks across domains. Due to the complexity of multi-agent embodied systems, existing methods fail to automatically generate safe and efficient training data for such systems. To this end, we propose the concept of compositional constraints for embodied multi-agent systems, addressing the challenges arising from collaboration among embodied agents. We design various interfaces tailored to different types of constraints, enabling seamless interaction with the physical world. Leveraging compositional constraints and specifically designed interfaces, we develop an automated data collection framework for embodied multi-agent systems and introduce the first benchmark for embodied multi-agent manipulation, RoboFactory. Based on RoboFactory benchmark, we adapt and evaluate the method of imitation learning and analyzed its performance in different difficulty agent tasks. Furthermore, we explore the architectures and training strategies for multi-agent imitation learning, aiming to build safe and efficient embodied multi-agent systems.

- **Summary**: DreamFusion established a new paradigm for unsupervised 3D reconstruction from virtual views by combining advances in generative models and differentiable rendering. However, the underlying multi-view rendering, along with supervision from large-scale generative models, is computationally expensive and under-constrained. We propose DreamTexture, a novel Shape-from-Virtual-Texture approach that leverages monocular depth cues to reconstruct 3D objects. Our method textures an input image by aligning a virtual texture with the real depth cues in the input, exploiting the inherent understanding of monocular geometry encoded in modern diffusion models. We then reconstruct depth from the virtual texture deformation with a new conformal map optimization, which alleviates memory-intensive volumetric representations. Our experiments reveal that generative models possess an understanding of monocular shape cues, which can be extracted by augmenting and aligning texture cues -- a novel monocular reconstruction paradigm that we call Analysis by Augmentation.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present 3D Spatial MultiModal Memory (M3), a multimodal memory system designed to retain information about medium-sized static scenes through video sources for visual perception. By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot. Notably, we claim that M3 is the first work to address the core compression challenges in 3D feature distillation.

- **Summary**: Achieving flexible and high-fidelity identity-preserved image generation remains formidable, particularly with advanced Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) like FLUX. We introduce InfiniteYou (InfU), one of the earliest robust frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. In addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various existing methods, offering a valuable contribution to the broader community.

We propose SynCity, a training- and optimization-free approach, which leverages the geometric precision of pre-trained 3D generative models and the artistic versatility of 2D image generators to create large, high-quality 3D spaces. While most 3D generative models are object-centric and cannot generate large-scale worlds, we show how 3D and 2D generators can be combined to generate ever-expanding scenes. Through a tile-based approach, we allow fine-grained control over the layout and the appearance of scenes. The world is generated tile-by-tile, and each new tile is generated within its world-context and then fused with the scene. SynCity generates compelling and immersive scenes that are rich in detail and diversity.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in video generation have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality and temporal coherence. Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics. Our project page are publicly available at https://quanhaol.github.io/magicmotion-site.

- **Summary**: 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has recently gained considerable attention as a method for reconstructing dynamic scenes. Despite achieving superior quality, 4DGS typically requires substantial storage and suffers from slow rendering speed. In this work, we delve into these issues and identify two key sources of temporal redundancy. (Q1) \textbf{Short-Lifespan Gaussians}: 4DGS uses a large portion of Gaussians with short temporal span to represent scene dynamics, leading to an excessive number of Gaussians. (Q2) \textbf{Inactive Gaussians}: When rendering, only a small subset of Gaussians contributes to each frame. Despite this, all Gaussians are processed during rasterization, resulting in redundant computation overhead. To address these redundancies, we present \textbf{4DGS-1K}, which runs at over 1000 FPS on modern GPUs. For Q1, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Variation Score, a new pruning criterion that effectively removes short-lifespan Gaussians while encouraging 4DGS to capture scene dynamics using Gaussians with longer temporal spans. For Q2, we store a mask for active Gaussians across consecutive frames, significantly reducing redundant computations in rendering. Compared to vanilla 4DGS, our method achieves a $41\times$ reduction in storage and $9\times$ faster rasterization speed on complex dynamic scenes, while maintaining comparable visual quality.

- **Summary**: Image geolocalization, in which, traditionally, an AI model predicts the precise GPS coordinates of an image is a challenging task with many downstream applications. However, the user cannot utilize the model to further their knowledge other than the GPS coordinate; the model lacks an understanding of the location and the conversational ability to communicate with the user. In recent days, with tremendous progress of large multimodal models (LMMs) proprietary and open-source researchers have attempted to geolocalize images via LMMs. However, the issues remain unaddressed; beyond general tasks, for more specialized downstream tasks, one of which is geolocalization, LMMs struggle. In this work, we propose to solve this problem by introducing a conversational model GAEA that can provide information regarding the location of an image, as required by a user. No large-scale dataset enabling the training of such a model exists. Thus we propose a comprehensive dataset GAEA with 800K images and around 1.6M question answer pairs constructed by leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) attributes and geographical context clues. For quantitative evaluation, we propose a diverse benchmark comprising 4K image-text pairs to evaluate conversational capabilities equipped with diverse question types. We consider 11 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LMMs and demonstrate that GAEA significantly outperforms the best open-source model, LLaVA-OneVision by 25.69% and the best proprietary model, GPT-4o by 8.28%.

- **Summary**: Differentiable vector graphics (VGs) are widely used in image vectorization and vector synthesis, while existing representations are costly to optimize and struggle to achieve high-quality rendering results for high-resolution images. This work introduces a new differentiable VG representation, dubbed B\'ezier splatting, that enables fast yet high-fidelity VG rasterization. B\'ezier splatting samples 2D Gaussians along B\'ezier curves, which naturally provide positional gradients at object boundaries. Thanks to the efficient splatting-based differentiable rasterizer, B\'ezier splatting achieves over 20x and 150x faster per forward and backward rasterization step for open curves compared to DiffVG. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive pruning and densification strategy that dynamically adjusts the spatial distribution of curves to escape local minima, further improving VG quality. Experimental results show that B\'ezier splatting significantly outperforms existing methods with better visual fidelity and 10x faster optimization speed.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a fundamentally new paradigm for image generation through set-based tokenization and distribution modeling. Unlike conventional methods that serialize images into fixed-position latent codes with a uniform compression ratio, we introduce an unordered token set representation to dynamically allocate coding capacity based on regional semantic complexity. This TokenSet enhances global context aggregation and improves robustness against local perturbations. To address the critical challenge of modeling discrete sets, we devise a dual transformation mechanism that bijectively converts sets into fixed-length integer sequences with summation constraints. Further, we propose Fixed-Sum Discrete Diffusion--the first framework to simultaneously handle discrete values, fixed sequence length, and summation invariance--enabling effective set distribution modeling.

- **Summary**: The advancement of remote sensing technology has improved the spatial resolution of satellite imagery, facilitating more detailed visual representations for diverse interpretations. However, existing methods exhibit limited generalization capabilities across varied applications. While some contemporary foundation models demonstrate potential, they are hindered by insufficient cross-task adaptability and primarily process low-resolution imagery of restricted sizes, thus failing to fully exploit high-resolution data or leverage comprehensive large-scene semantics. Crucially, remote sensing imagery differs fundamentally from natural images, as key foreground targets (eg., maritime objects, artificial structures) often occupy minimal spatial proportions (~1%) and exhibit sparse distributions. Efficiently modeling cross-task generalizable knowledge from lengthy 2D tokens (~100,000) poses a significant challenge yet remains critical for remote sensing image understanding. Motivated by the selective attention mechanisms inherent to the human visual system, we propose DynamicVis, a dynamic visual perception foundation model for remote sensing imagery. The framework integrates a novel dynamic region perception backbone based on the selective state space model, which strategically balances localized detail extraction with global contextual integration, enabling computationally efficient encoding of large-scale data while maintaining architectural scalability. To enhance cross-task knowledge transferring, we introduce a multi-instance learning paradigm utilizing meta-embedding representations, trained on million-scale region-level annotations. Evaluations across nine downstream tasks demonstrate the model's versatility. DynamicVis achieves multi-level feature modeling with exceptional efficiency, processing (2048x2048) pixels with 97 ms latency (6% of ViT's) and 833 MB GPU memory (3% of ViT's).

- **Summary**: Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) are vital for real-world applications but suffer high computational costs due to attention's quadratic complexity. Block-sparse attention mitigates this by focusing computation on critical regions, yet existing methods struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency due to costly block importance measurements. In this paper, we introduce XAttention, a plug-and-play framework that dramatically accelerates long-context inference in Transformers models using sparse attention. XAttention's key innovation is the insight that the sum of antidiagonal values (i.e., from the lower-left to upper-right) in the attention matrix provides a powerful proxy for block importance. This allows for precise identification and pruning of non-essential blocks, resulting in high sparsity and dramatically accelerated inference. Across comprehensive evaluations on demanding long-context benchmarks-including RULER and LongBench for language, VideoMME for video understanding, and VBench for video generation. XAttention achieves accuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial computational gains. We demonstrate up to 13.5x acceleration in attention computation. These results underscore XAttention's ability to unlock the practical potential of block sparse attention, paving the way for scalable and efficient deployment of LCTMs in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we question whether we have a reliable self-supervised point cloud model that can be used for diverse 3D tasks via simple linear probing, even with limited data and minimal computation. We find that existing 3D self-supervised learning approaches fall short when evaluated on representation quality through linear probing. We hypothesize that this is due to what we term the "geometric shortcut", which causes representations to collapse to low-level spatial features. This challenge is unique to 3D and arises from the sparse nature of point cloud data. We address it through two key strategies: obscuring spatial information and enhancing the reliance on input features, ultimately composing a Sonata of 140k point clouds through self-distillation. Sonata is simple and intuitive, yet its learned representations are strong and reliable: zero-shot visualizations demonstrate semantic grouping, alongside strong spatial reasoning through nearest-neighbor relationships. Sonata demonstrates exceptional parameter and data efficiency, tripling linear probing accuracy (from 21.8% to 72.5%) on ScanNet and nearly doubling performance with only 1% of the data compared to previous approaches. Full fine-tuning further advances SOTA across both 3D indoor and outdoor perception tasks.

- **Summary**: Autoregressive visual generation models typically rely on tokenizers to compress images into tokens that can be predicted sequentially. A fundamental dilemma exists in token representation: discrete tokens enable straightforward modeling with standard cross-entropy loss, but suffer from information loss and tokenizer training instability; continuous tokens better preserve visual details, but require complex distribution modeling, complicating the generation pipeline. In this paper, we propose TokenBridge, which bridges this gap by maintaining the strong representation capacity of continuous tokens while preserving the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. To achieve this, we decouple discretization from the tokenizer training process through post-training quantization that directly obtains discrete tokens from continuous representations. Specifically, we introduce a dimension-wise quantization strategy that independently discretizes each feature dimension, paired with a lightweight autoregressive prediction mechanism that efficiently model the resulting large token space. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves reconstruction and generation quality on par with continuous methods while using standard categorical prediction. This work demonstrates that bridging discrete and continuous paradigms can effectively harness the strengths of both approaches, providing a promising direction for high-quality visual generation with simple autoregressive modeling.
