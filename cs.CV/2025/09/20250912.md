- **Summary**: The practical adoption of deep learning in high-stakes forensic applications, such as dental age estimation, is often limited by the 'black box' nature of the models. This study introduces a framework designed to enhance both performance and transparency in this context. We use a notable performance disparity in the automated staging of mandibular second (tooth 37) and third (tooth 38) molars as a case study. The proposed framework, which combines a convolutional autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), improves classification accuracy for both teeth over a baseline ViT, increasing from 0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38. Beyond improving performance, the framework provides multi-faceted diagnostic insights. Analysis of the AE's latent space metrics and image reconstructions indicates that the remaining performance gap is data-centric, suggesting high intra-class morphological variability in the tooth 38 dataset is a primary limiting factor. This work highlights the insufficiency of relying on a single mode of interpretability, such as attention maps, which can appear anatomically plausible yet fail to identify underlying data issues. By offering a methodology that both enhances accuracy and provides evidence for why a model may be uncertain, this framework serves as a more robust tool to support expert decision-making in forensic age estimation.

- **Summary**: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Among existing approaches, Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) has emerged as an effective solution by incorporating a large amount of unlabeled data into the imbalanced labeled dataset. However, most prior LTSSL methods are designed to train models from scratch, which often leads to issues such as overconfidence and low-quality pseudo-labels. To address these challenges, we extend LTSSL into the foundation model fine-tuning paradigm and propose a novel framework: LoFT (Long-tailed semi-supervised learning via parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning). We demonstrate that fine-tuned foundation models can generate more reliable pseudolabels, thereby benefiting imbalanced learning. Furthermore, we explore a more practical setting by investigating semi-supervised learning under open-world conditions, where the unlabeled data may include out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. To handle this problem, we propose LoFT-OW (LoFT under Open-World scenarios) to improve the discriminative ability. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches, even when utilizing only 1\% of the unlabeled data compared with previous works.

- **Summary**: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) addresses the challenge of adapting a model to a target domain without access to the data of the source domain. Prevailing methods typically start with a source model pre-trained with full supervision and distill the knowledge by aligning instance-level features. However, these approaches, relying on cosine similarity over L2-normalized feature vectors, inadvertently discard crucial geometric information about the latent manifold of the source model. We introduce Self-supervised Continual Domain Adaptation (SCoDA) to address these limitations. We make two key departures from standard practice: first, we avoid the reliance on supervised pre-training by initializing the proposed framework with a teacher model pre-trained entirely via self-supervision (SSL). Second, we adapt the principle of geometric manifold alignment to the SFDA setting. The student is trained with a composite objective combining instance-level feature matching with a Space Similarity Loss. To combat catastrophic forgetting, the teacher's parameters are updated via an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the student's parameters. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCoDA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods.

- **Summary**: Tracking cells and detecting mitotic events in time-lapse microscopy image sequences is a crucial task in biomedical research. However, it remains highly challenging due to dividing objects, low signal-tonoise ratios, indistinct boundaries, dense clusters, and the visually similar appearance of individual cells. Existing deep learning-based methods rely on manually labeled datasets for training, which is both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, their generalizability to unseen datasets remains limited due to the vast diversity of microscopy data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a zero-shot cell tracking framework by integrating Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), a large foundation model designed for general image and video segmentation, into the tracking pipeline. As a fully-unsupervised approach, our method does not depend on or inherit biases from any specific training dataset, allowing it to generalize across diverse microscopy datasets without finetuning. Our approach achieves competitive accuracy in both 2D and large-scale 3D time-lapse microscopy videos while eliminating the need for dataset-specific adaptation.

- **Summary**: Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking (MTMC) is an essential computer vision task for automating large-scale surveillance. With camera calibration and depth information, the targets in the scene can be projected into 3D space, offering unparalleled levels of automatic perception of a 3D environment. However, tracking in the 3D space requires replacing all 2D tracking components from the ground up, which may be infeasible for existing MTMC systems. In this paper, we present an approach for extending any online 2D multi-camera tracking system into 3D space by utilizing depth information to reconstruct a target in point-cloud space, and recovering its 3D box through clustering and yaw refinement following tracking. We also introduced an enhanced online data association mechanism that leverages the target's local ID consistency to assign global IDs across frames. The proposed framework is evaluated on the 2025 AI City Challenge's 3D MTMC dataset, achieving 3rd place on the leaderboard.

- **Summary**: Material creation and reconstruction are crucial for appearance modeling but traditionally require significant time and expertise from artists. While recent methods leverage visual foundation models to synthesize PBR materials from user-provided inputs, they often fall short in quality, flexibility, and user control. We propose a novel two-stage generate-and-estimate framework for PBR material generation. In the generation stage, a fine-tuned diffusion model synthesizes shaded, tileable texture images aligned with user input. In the estimation stage, we introduce a chained decomposition scheme that sequentially predicts SVBRDF channels by passing previously extracted representation as input into a single-step image-conditional diffusion model. Our method is efficient, high quality, and enables flexible user control. We evaluate our approach against existing material generation and estimation methods, demonstrating superior performance. Our material estimation method shows strong robustness on both generated textures and in-the-wild photographs. Furthermore, we highlight the flexibility of our framework across diverse applications, including text-to-material, image-to-material, structure-guided generation, and material editing.

- **Summary**: Large-scale transformers are central to modern semantic communication, yet their high computational and communication costs hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper introduces a training-free framework for adaptive token merging, a novel mechanism that compresses transformer representations at runtime by selectively merging semantically redundant tokens under per-layer similarity thresholds. Unlike prior fixed-ratio reduction, our approach couples merging directly to input redundancy, enabling data-dependent adaptation that balances efficiency and task relevance without retraining. We cast the discovery of merging strategies as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverage Bayesian optimization to obtain Pareto-optimal trade-offs between accuracy, inference cost, and communication cost. On ImageNet classification, we match the accuracy of the unmodified transformer with 30\% fewer floating-point operations per second and under 20\% of the original communication cost, while for visual question answering our method achieves performance competitive with the full LLaVA model at less than one-third of the compute and one-tenth of the bandwidth. Finally, we show that our adaptive merging is robust across varying channel conditions and provides inherent privacy benefits, substantially degrading the efficacy of model inversion attacks. Our framework provides a practical and versatile solution for deploying powerful transformer models in resource-limited edge intelligence scenarios.

- **Summary**: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is usually addressed with task-trained grounding models. We show that a zero-shot workflow, without any REC-specific training, can achieve competitive or superior performance. Our approach reformulates REC as box-wise visual-language verification: given proposals from a COCO-clean generic detector (YOLO-World), a general-purpose VLM independently answers True/False queries for each region. This simple procedure reduces cross-box interference, supports abstention and multiple matches, and requires no fine-tuning. On RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, our method not only surpasses a zero-shot GroundingDINO baseline but also exceeds reported results for GroundingDINO trained on REC and GroundingDINO+CRG. Controlled studies with identical proposals confirm that verification significantly outperforms selection-based prompting, and results hold with open VLMs. Overall, we show that workflow design, rather than task-specific pretraining, drives strong zero-shot REC performance.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of foliar diseases and insect damage in wheat is crucial for effective crop management and disease control. However, the insect damage typically occupies only a tiny fraction of annotated pixels. This extreme pixel-level imbalance poses a significant challenge to the segmentation performance, which can result in overfitting to common classes and insufficient learning of rare classes, thereby impairing overall performance. In this paper, we propose a Random Projected Copy-and-Paste (RPCP) augmentation technique to address the pixel imbalance problem. Specifically, we extract rare insect-damage patches from annotated training images and apply random geometric transformations to simulate variations. The transformed patches are then pasted in appropriate regions while avoiding overlaps with lesions or existing damaged regions. In addition, we apply a random projection filter to the pasted regions, refining local features and ensuring a natural blend with the new background. Experiments show that our method substantially improves segmentation performance on the insect damage class, while maintaining or even slightly enhancing accuracy on other categories. Our results highlight the effectiveness of targeted augmentation in mitigating extreme pixel imbalance, offering a straightforward yet effective solution for agricultural segmentation problems.

- **Summary**: The need for long-term multi-object tracking (MOT) is growing due to the demand for analyzing individual behaviors in videos that span several minutes. Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals, our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21 identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new 10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at: https://github.com/ngobibibnbe/uncertain-identity-aware-tracking

- **Summary**: Event camera sensors are bio-inspired sensors which asynchronously capture per-pixel brightness changes and output a stream of events encoding the polarity, location and time of these changes. These systems are witnessing rapid advancements as an emerging field, driven by their low latency, reduced power consumption, and ultra-high capture rates. This survey explores the evolution of fusing event-stream captured with traditional frame-based capture, highlighting how this synergy significantly benefits various video restoration and 3D reconstruction tasks. The paper systematically reviews major deep learning contributions to image/video enhancement and restoration, focusing on two dimensions: temporal enhancement (such as frame interpolation and motion deblurring) and spatial enhancement (including super-resolution, low-light and HDR enhancement, and artifact reduction). This paper also explores how the 3D reconstruction domain evolves with the advancement of event driven fusion. Diverse topics are covered, with in-depth discussions on recent works for improving visual quality under challenging conditions. Additionally, the survey compiles a comprehensive list of openly available datasets, enabling reproducible research and benchmarking. By consolidating recent progress and insights, this survey aims to inspire further research into leveraging event camera systems, especially in combination with deep learning, for advanced visual media restoration and enhancement.

- **Summary**: This study addresses the escalating threat of branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) to California's tomato industry, which supplies over 90 percent of U.S. processing tomatoes. The parasite's largely underground life cycle makes early detection difficult, while conventional chemical controls are costly, environmentally harmful, and often ineffective. To address this, we combined drone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested tomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages determined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to isolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with 79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating later stages. Incorporating sequential growth stages with LSTM improved detection substantially. The best-performing scenario, which integrated all growth stages with SMOTE augmentation, achieved 88.37 percent overall accuracy and 95.37 percent recall. These results demonstrate the strong potential of temporal multispectral analysis and LSTM networks for early broomrape detection. While further real-world data collection is needed for practical deployment, this study shows that UAV-based multispectral sensing coupled with deep learning could provide a powerful precision agriculture tool to reduce losses and improve sustainability in tomato production.

- **Summary**: RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lsying009/ISTASTrack.git.

- **Summary**: Accurate and reliable solar flare predictions are essential to mitigate potential impacts on critical infrastructure. However, the current performance of solar flare forecasting is insufficient. In this study, we address the task of predicting the class of the largest solar flare expected to occur within the next 72 hours. Existing methods often fail to adequately address the severe class imbalance across flare classes. To address this issue, we propose a solar flare prediction model based on multiple deep state space models. In addition, we introduce the frequency & local-boundary-aware reliability loss (FLARE loss) to improve predictive performance and reliability under class imbalance. Experiments were conducted on a multi-wavelength solar image dataset covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle. As a result, our method outperformed baseline approaches in terms of both the Gandin-Murphy-Gerrity score and the true skill statistic, which are standard metrics in terms of the performance and reliability.

- **Summary**: RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation improves the environmental perception of autonomous platforms in challenging conditions. Prevailing models employ encoders pre-trained on RGB images to extract features from both RGB and infrared inputs, and design additional modules to achieve cross-modal feature fusion. This results in limited thermal feature extraction and suboptimal cross-modal fusion, while the redundant encoders further compromises the model's real-time efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose TUNI, with an RGB-T encoder consisting of multiple stacked blocks that simultaneously perform multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. By leveraging large-scale pre-training with RGB and pseudo-thermal data, the RGB-T encoder learns to integrate feature extraction and fusion in a unified manner. By slimming down the thermal branch, the encoder achieves a more compact architecture. Moreover, we introduce an RGB-T local module to strengthen the encoder's capacity for cross-modal local feature fusion. The RGB-T local module employs adaptive cosine similarity to selectively emphasize salient consistent and distinct local features across RGB-T modalities. Experimental results show that TUNI achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on FMB, PST900 and CART, with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Meanwhile, it achieves an inference speed of 27 FPS on a Jetson Orin NX, demonstrating its real-time capability in deployment. Codes are available at https://github.com/xiaodonguo/TUNI.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel model of few-part-shot font generation, which designs an entire font based on a set of partial design elements, i.e., partial shapes. Unlike conventional few-shot font generation, which requires entire character shapes for a couple of character classes, our approach only needs partial shapes as input. The proposed model not only improves the efficiency of font creation but also provides insights into how partial design details influence the entire structure of the individual characters.

- **Summary**: Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a widely used computer vision method that determines an agent's movement through a camera and an IMU sensor. This paper presents an efficient and accurate VIO pipeline optimized for applications on micro- and nano-UAVs. The proposed design incorporates state-of-the-art feature detection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), all optimized and quantized for emerging RISC-V-based ultra-low-power parallel systems on chips (SoCs). Furthermore, by employing a rigid body motion model, the pipeline reduces estimation errors and achieves improved accuracy in planar motion scenarios. The pipeline's suitability for real-time VIO is assessed on an ultra-low-power SoC in terms of compute requirements and tracking accuracy after quantization. The pipeline, including the three feature tracking methods, was implemented on the SoC for real-world validation. This design bridges the gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on computationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for microcontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates an average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline pipeline when using the ORB feature tracker. The analysis of the computational complexity of the feature trackers further shows that PX4FLOW achieves on-par tracking accuracy with ORB at a lower runtime for movement speeds below 24 pixels/frame.

- **Summary**: Recovering 3D face models from 2D in-the-wild images has gained considerable attention in the computer vision community due to its wide range of potential applications. However, the lack of ground-truth labeled datasets and the complexity of real-world environments remain significant challenges. In this chapter, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach, the Hierarchical Multi-Level Attention Network (MLANet), for reconstructing 3D face models from single in-the-wild images. Our model predicts detailed facial geometry, texture, pose, and illumination parameters from a single image. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained hierarchical backbone network and introduce multi-level attention mechanisms at different stages of 2D face image feature extraction. A semi-supervised training strategy is employed, incorporating 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from publicly available datasets along with a differentiable renderer, enabling an end-to-end training process. Extensive experiments, including both comparative and ablation studies, were conducted on two benchmark datasets, AFLW2000-3D and MICC Florence, focusing on 3D face reconstruction and 3D face alignment tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: As large vision language models (VLMs) advance, their capabilities in multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) have significantly improved. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box (BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up to \(\sim\)9.5\% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by \(\sim\)2.6\%. Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513 and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial deployment.

- **Summary**: Accurate color alignment in text-to-image (T2I) generation is critical for applications such as fashion, product visualization, and interior design, yet current diffusion models struggle with nuanced and compound color terms (e.g., Tiffany blue, lime green, hot pink), often producing images that are misaligned with human intent. Existing approaches rely on cross-attention manipulation, reference images, or fine-tuning but fail to systematically resolve ambiguous color descriptions. To precisely render colors under prompt ambiguity, we propose a training-free framework that enhances color fidelity by leveraging a large language model (LLM) to disambiguate color-related prompts and guiding color blending operations directly in the text embedding space. Our method first employs a large language model (LLM) to resolve ambiguous color terms in the text prompt, and then refines the text embeddings based on the spatial relationships of the resulting color terms in the CIELAB color space. Unlike prior methods, our approach improves color accuracy without requiring additional training or external reference images. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves color alignment without compromising image quality, bridging the gap between text semantics and visual generation.

- **Summary**: Mathematical reasoning is critical for tasks such as precise distance and area computations, trajectory estimations, and spatial analysis in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) have not been adequately tested in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce AVI-Math, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate multimodal mathematical reasoning in aerial vehicle imagery, moving beyond simple counting tasks to include domain-specific knowledge in areas such as geometry, logic, and algebra. The dataset comprises 3,773 high-quality vehicle-related questions captured from UAV views, covering 6 mathematical subjects and 20 topics. The data, collected at varying altitudes and from multiple UAV angles, reflects real-world UAV scenarios, ensuring the diversity and complexity of the constructed mathematical problems. In this paper, we benchmark 14 prominent VLMs through a comprehensive evaluation and demonstrate that, despite their success on previous multimodal benchmarks, these models struggle with the reasoning tasks in AVI-Math. Our detailed analysis highlights significant limitations in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of current VLMs and suggests avenues for future research. Furthermore, we explore the use of Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning techniques, which show promise in addressing the reasoning challenges in AVI-Math. Our findings not only expose the limitations of VLMs in mathematical reasoning but also offer valuable insights for advancing UAV-based trustworthy VLMs in real-world applications. The code, and datasets will be released at https://github.com/VisionXLab/avi-math

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safe and efficient navigation. To improve prediction accuracy, recent approaches often rely on pre-built high-definition (HD) maps or real-time local map construction modules to incorporate static environmental information. However, pre-built HD maps are limited to specific regions and cannot adapt to transient changes. In addition, local map construction modules, which recognize only predefined elements, may fail to capture critical scene details or introduce errors that degrade prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a novel trajectory prediction framework that operates directly in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space utilizing real-time sensor data without relying on any pre-built maps. The BEVTraj leverages deformable attention to efficiently extract relevant context from dense BEV features. Furthermore, we introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) module, which enables full end-to-end prediction without requiring any post-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models while offering greater flexibility by eliminating the dependency on pre-built maps.

- **Summary**: Multi-human parsing is the task of segmenting human body parts while associating each part to the person it belongs to, combining instance-level and part-level information for fine-grained human understanding. In this work, we demonstrate that, while state-of-the-art approaches achieved notable results on public datasets, they struggle considerably in segmenting people with overlapping bodies. From the intuition that overlapping people may appear separated from a different point of view, we propose a novel training framework exploiting multi-view information to improve multi-human parsing models under occlusions. Our method integrates such knowledge during the training process, introducing a novel approach based on weak supervision on human instances and a multi-view consistency loss. Given the lack of suitable datasets in the literature, we propose a semi-automatic annotation strategy to generate human instance segmentation masks from multi-view RGB+D data and 3D human skeletons. The experiments demonstrate that the approach can achieve up to a 4.20\% relative improvement on human parsing over the baseline model in occlusion scenarios.

- **Summary**: The increasing labor shortage and aging population underline the need for assistive robots to support human care recipients. To enable safe and responsive assistance, robots require accurate human motion prediction in physical interaction scenarios. However, this remains a challenging task due to the variability of assistive settings and the complexity of coupled dynamics in physical interactions. In this work, we address these challenges through two key contributions: (1) HHI-Assist, a dataset comprising motion capture clips of human-human interactions in assistive tasks; and (2) a conditional Transformer-based denoising diffusion model for predicting the poses of interacting agents. Our model effectively captures the coupled dynamics between caregivers and care receivers, demonstrating improvements over baselines and strong generalization to unseen scenarios. By advancing interaction-aware motion prediction and introducing a new dataset, our work has the potential to significantly enhance robotic assistance policies.

- **Summary**: A division-of-focal-plane (DoFP) polarimeter enables us to acquire images with multiple polarization orientations in one shot and thus it is valuable for many applications using polarimetric information. The image processing pipeline for a DoFP polarimeter entails two crucial tasks: denoising and demosaicking. While polarization demosaicking for a noise-free case has increasingly been studied, the research for the joint task of polarization denoising and demosaicking is scarce due to the lack of a suitable evaluation dataset and a solid baseline method. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset and method for polarization denoising and demosaicking. Our dataset contains 40 real-world scenes and three noise-level conditions, consisting of pairs of noisy mosaic inputs and noise-free full images. Our method takes a denoising-then-demosaicking approach based on well-accepted signal processing components to offer a reproducible method. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits higher image reconstruction performance than other alternative methods, offering a solid baseline.

- **Summary**: We introduce VARCO-VISION-2.0, an open-weight bilingual vision-language model (VLM) for Korean and English with improved capabilities compared to the previous model VARCO-VISION-14B. The model supports multi-image understanding for complex inputs such as documents, charts, and tables, and delivers layoutaware OCR by predicting both textual content and its spatial location. Trained with a four-stage curriculum with memory-efficient techniques, the model achieves enhanced multimodal alignment, while preserving core language abilities and improving safety via preference optimization. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate strong spatial grounding and competitive results for both languages, with the 14B model achieving 8th place on the OpenCompass VLM leaderboard among models of comparable scale. Alongside the 14B-scale model, we release a 1.7B version optimized for on-device deployment. We believe these models advance the development of bilingual VLMs and their practical applications. Two variants of VARCO-VISION-2.0 are available at Hugging Face: a full-scale 14B model and a lightweight 1.7B model.

- **Summary**: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) plays a critical role in face recognition and verification systems, especially in uncontrolled, real-world environments. Although several methods have been proposed, general-purpose no-reference image quality assessment techniques often fail to capture face-specific degradations. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art FIQA models tend to be computationally intensive, limiting their practical applicability. We propose a lightweight and efficient method for FIQA, designed for the perceptual evaluation of face images in the wild. Our approach integrates an ensemble of two compact convolutional neural networks, MobileNetV3-Small and ShuffleNetV2, with prediction-level fusion via simple averaging. To enhance alignment with human perceptual judgments, we employ a correlation-aware loss (MSECorrLoss), combining mean squared error (MSE) with a Pearson correlation regularizer. Our method achieves a strong balance between accuracy and computational cost, making it suitable for real-world deployment. Experiments on the VQualA FIQA benchmark demonstrate that our model achieves a Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9829 and a Pearson linear correlation coefficient (PLCC) of 0.9894, remaining within competition efficiency constraints.



### Realism Control One-step Diffusion for Real-World Image Super-Resolution

- **Summary**: Pre-trained diffusion models have shown great potential in real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) tasks by enabling high-resolution reconstructions. While one-step diffusion (OSD) methods significantly improve efficiency compared to traditional multi-step approaches, they still have limitations in balancing fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios. Since the OSDs for SR are usually trained or distilled by a single timestep, they lack flexible control mechanisms to adaptively prioritize these competing objectives, which are inherently manageable in multi-step methods through adjusting sampling steps. To address this challenge, we propose a Realism Controlled One-step Diffusion (RCOD) framework for Real-ISR. RCOD provides a latent domain grouping strategy that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs during the noise prediction phase with minimal training paradigm modifications and original training data. A degradation-aware sampling strategy is also introduced to align distillation regularization with the grouping strategy and enhance the controlling of trade-offs. Moreover, a visual prompt injection module is used to replace conventional text prompts with degradation-aware visual tokens, enhancing both restoration accuracy and semantic consistency. Our method achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCOD outperforms state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and visual qualities, with flexible realism control capabilities in the inference stage. The code will be released.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of the optic disc and cup is critical for the early diagnosis and management of ocular diseases such as glaucoma. However, segmentation models trained on one dataset often suffer significant performance degradation when applied to target data acquired under different imaging protocols or conditions. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Grad-CL}, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework that leverages a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data to robustly adapt segmentation performance without requiring access to the original source data. Grad-CL combines a gradient-guided pseudolabel refinement module with a cosine similarity-based contrastive learning strategy. In the first stage, salient class-specific features are extracted via a gradient-based mechanism, enabling more accurate uncertainty quantification and robust prototype estimation for refining noisy pseudolabels. In the second stage, a contrastive loss based on cosine similarity is employed to explicitly enforce inter-class separability between the gradient-informed features of the optic cup and disc. Extensive experiments on challenging cross-domain fundus imaging datasets demonstrate that Grad-CL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and source-free domain adaptation methods, achieving superior segmentation accuracy and improved boundary delineation.

- **Summary**: Vector quantization (VQ) is a key component in discrete tokenizers for image generation, but its training is often unstable due to straight-through estimation bias, one-step-behind updates, and sparse codebook gradients, which lead to suboptimal reconstruction performance and low codebook usage. In this work, we analyze these fundamental challenges and provide a simple yet effective solution. To maintain high codebook usage in VQ networks (VQN) during learning annealing and codebook size expansion, we propose VQBridge, a robust, scalable, and efficient projector based on the map function method. VQBridge optimizes code vectors through a compress-process-recover pipeline, enabling stable and effective codebook training. By combining VQBridge with learning annealing, our VQN achieves full (100%) codebook usage across diverse codebook configurations, which we refer to as FVQ (FullVQ). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FVQ is effective, scalable, and generalizable: it attains 100% codebook usage even with a 262k-codebook, achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, consistently improves with larger codebooks, higher vector channels, or longer training, and remains effective across different VQ variants. Moreover, when integrated with LlamaGen, FVQ significantly enhances image generation performance, surpassing visual autoregressive models (VAR) by 0.5 and diffusion models (DiT) by 0.2 rFID, highlighting the importance of high-quality tokenizers for strong autoregressive image generation.

- **Summary**: We introduce LayerLock, a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised visual representation learning, that gradually transitions from pixel to latent prediction through progressive layer freezing. First, we make the observation that during training of video masked-autoencoding (MAE) models, ViT layers converge in the order of their depth: shallower layers converge early, deeper layers converge late. We then show that this observation can be exploited to accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not suffer from "representation collapse". We apply our proposed approach, LayerLock, to large models of up to 4B parameters with results surpassing those of non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.

- **Summary**: We present the first systematic comparison of implicit and explicit Novel View Synthesis methods for space-based 3D object reconstruction, evaluating the role of appearance embeddings. While embeddings improve photometric fidelity by modeling lighting variation, we show they do not translate into meaningful gains in geometric accuracy - a critical requirement for space robotics applications. Using the SPEED+ dataset, we compare K-Planes, Gaussian Splatting, and Convex Splatting, and demonstrate that embeddings primarily reduce the number of primitives needed for explicit methods rather than enhancing geometric fidelity. Moreover, convex splatting achieves more compact and clutter-free representations than Gaussian splatting, offering advantages for safety-critical applications such as interaction and collision avoidance. Our findings clarify the limits of appearance embeddings for geometry-centric tasks and highlight trade-offs between reconstruction quality and representation efficiency in space scenarios.

- **Summary**: With generative models becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse, detecting AI-generated images has become increasingly challenging. While existing AI-genereted Image detectors achieve promising performance on in-distribution generated images, their generalization to unseen generative models remains limited. This limitation is largely attributed to their reliance on generation-specific artifacts, such as stylistic priors and compression patterns. To address these limitations, we propose GAMMA, a novel training framework designed to reduce domain bias and enhance semantic alignment. GAMMA introduces diverse manipulation strategies, such as inpainting-based manipulation and semantics-preserving perturbations, to ensure consistency between manipulated and authentic content. We employ multi-task supervision with dual segmentation heads and a classification head, enabling pixel-level source attribution across diverse generative domains. In addition, a reverse cross-attention mechanism is introduced to allow the segmentation heads to guide and correct biased representations in the classification branch. Our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on the GenImage benchmark, imporving accuracy by 5.8%, but also maintains strong robustness on newly released generative model such as GPT-4o.

- **Summary**: Fetal brain MRI relies on rapid multi-view 2D slice acquisitions to reduce motion artifacts caused by fetal movement. However, these stacks are typically low resolution, may suffer from motion corruption, and do not adequately capture 3D anatomy. Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods aim to address these limitations by combining slice-to-volume registration and super-resolution techniques to generate high-resolution (HR) 3D volumes. While several SRR methods have been proposed, their comparative performance - particularly in pathological cases - and their influence on downstream volumetric analysis and diagnostic tasks remain underexplored. In this study, we applied three state-of-the-art SRR method - NiftyMIC, SVRTK, and NeSVoR - to 140 fetal brain MRI scans, including both healthy controls (HC) and pathological cases (PC) with ventriculomegaly (VM). Each HR reconstruction was segmented using the BoUNTi algorithm to extract volumes of nine principal brain structures. We evaluated visual quality, SRR success rates, volumetric measurement agreement, and diagnostic classification performance. NeSVoR demonstrated the highest and most consistent reconstruction success rate (>90%) across both HC and PC groups. Although significant differences in volumetric estimates were observed between SRR methods, classification performance for VM was not affected by the choice of SRR method. These findings highlight NeSVoR's robustness and the resilience of diagnostic performance despite SRR-induced volumetric variability.

- **Summary**: Object removal, a challenging task within image inpainting, involves seamlessly filling the removed region with content that matches the surrounding context. Despite advancements in diffusion models, current methods still face two critical challenges. The first is mask hallucination, where the model generates irrelevant or spurious content inside the masked region, and the second is mask-shape bias, where the model fills the masked area with an object that mimics the mask's shape rather than surrounding content. To address these issues, we propose Mask Consistency Regularization (MCR), a novel training strategy designed specifically for object removal tasks. During training, our approach introduces two mask perturbations: dilation and reshape, enforcing consistency between the outputs of these perturbed branches and the original mask. The dilated masks help align the model's output with the surrounding content, while reshaped masks encourage the model to break the mask-shape bias. This combination of strategies enables MCR to produce more robust and contextually coherent inpainting results. Our experiments demonstrate that MCR significantly reduces hallucinations and mask-shape bias, leading to improved performance in object removal.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress in instruction following and aesthetics. However, a persistent challenge is the prevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws, which severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the diversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained evaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development.

- **Summary**: Sign language translation (SLT) aims to translate natural language from sign language videos, serving as a vital bridge for inclusive communication. While recent advances leverage powerful visual backbones and large language models, most approaches mainly focus on manual signals (hand gestures) and tend to overlook non-manual cues like mouthing. In fact, mouthing conveys essential linguistic information in sign languages and plays a crucial role in disambiguating visually similar signs. In this paper, we propose SignClip, a novel framework to improve the accuracy of sign language translation. It fuses manual and non-manual cues, specifically spatial gesture and lip movement features. Besides, SignClip introduces a hierarchical contrastive learning framework with multi-level alignment objectives, ensuring semantic consistency across sign-lip and visual-text modalities. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. For example, on PHOENIX14T, in the Gloss-free setting, SignClip surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model SpaMo, improving BLEU-4 from 24.32 to 24.71, and ROUGE from 46.57 to 48.38.

- **Summary**: Recent works have shown the effectiveness of Large Vision Language Models (VLMs or LVLMs) in image manipulation detection. However, text manipulation detection is largely missing in these studies. We bridge this knowledge gap by analyzing closed- and open-source VLMs on different text manipulation datasets. Our results suggest that open-source models are getting closer, but still behind closed-source ones like GPT- 4o. Additionally, we benchmark image manipulation detection-specific VLMs for text manipulation detection and show that they suffer from the generalization problem. We benchmark VLMs for manipulations done on in-the-wild scene texts and on fantasy ID cards, where the latter mimic a challenging real-world misuse.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot 3D (ZS-3D) anomaly detection aims to identify defects in 3D objects without relying on labeled training data, making it especially valuable in scenarios constrained by data scarcity, privacy, or high annotation cost. However, most existing methods focus exclusively on point clouds, neglecting the rich semantic cues available from complementary modalities such as RGB images and texts priors. This paper introduces MCL-AD, a novel framework that leverages multimodal collaboration learning across point clouds, RGB images, and texts semantics to achieve superior zero-shot 3D anomaly detection. Specifically, we propose a Multimodal Prompt Learning Mechanism (MPLM) that enhances the intra-modal representation capability and inter-modal collaborative learning by introducing an object-agnostic decoupled text prompt and a multimodal contrastive loss. In addition, a collaborative modulation mechanism (CMM) is proposed to fully leverage the complementary representations of point clouds and RGB images by jointly modulating the RGB image-guided and point cloud-guided branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MCL-AD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-3D anomaly detection.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks and Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance in computer vision but are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Standard defenses often incur high computational cost or lack formal guarantees. We propose a Lipschitz-guided stochastic depth (DropPath) method, where drop probabilities increase with depth to control the effective Lipschitz constant of the network. This approach regularizes deeper layers, improving robustness while preserving clean accuracy and reducing computation. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ViT-Tiny show that our custom depth-dependent schedule maintains near-baseline clean accuracy, enhances robustness under FGSM, PGD-20, and AutoAttack, and significantly reduces FLOPs compared to baseline and linear DropPath schedules.

- **Summary**: In this paper we address the problem of precise geolocation of street furniture in complex urban environments, which is a critical task for effective monitoring and maintenance of public infrastructure by local authorities and private stakeholders. To this end, we propose a probabilistic framework based on energy maps that encode the spatial likelihood of object locations. Representing the energy in a map-based geopositioned format allows the optimisation process to seamlessly integrate external geospatial information, such as GIS layers, road maps, or placement constraints, which improves contextual awareness and localisation accuracy. A stochastic birth-and-death optimisation algorithm is introduced to infer the most probable configuration of assets. We evaluate our approach using a realistic simulation informed by a geolocated dataset of street lighting infrastructure in Dublin city centre, demonstrating its potential for scalable and accurate urban asset mapping. The implementation of the algorithm will be made available in the GitHub repository https://github.com/EMurphy0108/SBD_Street_Furniture.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Diffusion transformers have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, yet still suffer from a huge computational cost due to their iterative denoising process. Recently, feature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the following timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models while ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we introduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and complementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa performs spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token in each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which is able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any diffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa achieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing the original model by 0.51%.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently achieved strong results in semantic segmentation, yet their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains limited due to their high memory footprint and computational cost. Quantization offers an effective strategy to improve efficiency, but ViT-based segmentation models are notoriously fragile under low precision, as quantization errors accumulate across deep encoder-decoder pipelines. We introduce I-Segmenter, the first fully integer-only ViT segmentation framework. Building on the Segmenter architecture, I-Segmenter systematically replaces floating-point operations with integer-only counterparts. To further stabilize both training and inference, we propose $\lambda$-ShiftGELU, a novel activation function that mitigates the limitations of uniform quantization in handling long-tailed activation distributions. In addition, we remove the L2 normalization layer and replace bilinear interpolation in the decoder with nearest neighbor upsampling, ensuring integer-only execution throughout the computational graph. Extensive experiments show that I-Segmenter achieves accuracy within a reasonable margin of its FP32 baseline (5.1 % on average), while reducing model size by up to 3.8x and enabling up to 1.2x faster inference with optimized runtimes. Notably, even in one-shot PTQ with a single calibration image, I-Segmenter delivers competitive accuracy, underscoring its practicality for real-world deployment.

- **Summary**: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a vital imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases. However, OCT images are inherently degraded by speckle noise, which obscures fine details and hinders accurate interpretation. While numerous denoising methods exist, many struggle to balance noise reduction with the preservation of crucial anatomical structures. This paper introduces GARD (Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising), a novel deep learning approach for OCT image despeckling that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models. Unlike conventional diffusion models that assume Gaussian noise, GARD employs a Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model to more accurately reflect the statistical properties of speckle. Furthermore, we introduce a Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term that utilizes a pre-processed, less-noisy image to guide the denoising process. This crucial addition prevents the reintroduction of high-frequency noise. We accelerate the inference process by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model framework to our Gamma-based model. Experiments on a dataset with paired noisy and less-noisy OCT B-scans demonstrate that GARD significantly outperforms traditional denoising methods and state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and MSE. Qualitative results confirm that GARD produces sharper edges and better preserves fine anatomical details.

- **Summary**: Mammography screening is an essential tool for early detection of breast cancer. The speed and accuracy of mammography interpretation have the potential to be improved with deep learning methods. However, the development of a foundation visual language model (VLM) is hindered by limited data and domain differences between natural and medical images. Existing mammography VLMs, adapted from natural images, often ignore domain-specific characteristics, such as multi-view relationships in mammography. Unlike radiologists who analyze both views together to process ipsilateral correspondence, current methods treat them as independent images or do not properly model the multi-view correspondence learning, losing critical geometric context and resulting in suboptimal prediction. We propose GLAM: Global and Local Alignment for Multi-view mammography for VLM pretraining using geometry guidance. By leveraging the prior knowledge about the multi-view imaging process of mammograms, our model learns local cross-view alignments and fine-grained local features through joint global and local, visual-visual, and visual-language contrastive learning. Pretrained on EMBED [14], one of the largest open mammography datasets, our model outperforms baselines across multiple datasets under different settings.

- **Summary**: Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension, answering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos, caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we review representative works across the key areas of research on modern general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally, we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising directions for future research.

- **Summary**: Overconfidence in deep learning models poses a significant risk in high-stakes medical imaging tasks, particularly in multi-label classification of chest X-rays, where multiple co-occurring pathologies must be detected simultaneously. This study introduces an uncertainty-aware framework for chest X-ray diagnosis based on a DenseNet-121 backbone, enhanced with two selective prediction mechanisms: entropy-based rejection and confidence interval-based rejection. Both methods enable the model to abstain from uncertain predictions, improving reliability by deferring ambiguous cases to clinical experts. A quantile-based calibration procedure is employed to tune rejection thresholds using either global or class-specific strategies. Experiments conducted on three large public datasets (PadChest, NIH ChestX-ray14, and MIMIC-CXR) demonstrate that selective rejection improves the trade-off between diagnostic accuracy and coverage, with entropy-based rejection yielding the highest average AUC across all pathologies. These results support the integration of selective prediction into AI-assisted diagnostic workflows, providing a practical step toward safer, uncertainty-aware deployment of deep learning in clinical settings.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-based image editing have enabled fine-grained manipulation of visual content guided by natural language. However, such methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel attack that targets the visual component of editing methods. We introduce Attention Attack, which disrupts the cross-attention between a textual prompt and the visual representation of the image by using an automatically generated caption of the source image as a proxy for the edit prompt. This breaks the alignment between the contents of the image and their textual description, without requiring knowledge of the editing method or the editing prompt. Reflecting on the reliability of existing metrics for immunization success, we propose two novel evaluation strategies: Caption Similarity, which quantifies semantic consistency between original and adversarial edits, and semantic Intersection over Union (IoU), which measures spatial layout disruption via segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on the TEDBench++ benchmark demonstrate that our attack significantly degrades editing performance while remaining imperceptible.

- **Summary**: Learned image compression sits at the intersection of machine learning and image processing. With advances in deep learning, neural network-based compression methods have emerged. In this process, an encoder maps the image to a low-dimensional latent space, which is then quantized, entropy-coded into a binary bitstream, and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver end, the bitstream is entropy-decoded, and a decoder reconstructs an approximation of the original image. Recent research suggests that these models consistently outperform conventional codecs. However, they require significant processing power, making them unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained platforms, which hinders their deployment in mainstream applications. This study aims to reduce the resource requirements of neural networks used for image compression by leveraging knowledge distillation, a training paradigm where smaller neural networks, partially trained on the outputs of larger, more complex models, can achieve better performance than when trained independently. Our work demonstrates that knowledge distillation can be effectively applied to image compression tasks: i) across various architecture sizes, ii) to achieve different image quality/bit rate tradeoffs, and iii) to save processing and energy resources. This approach introduces new settings and hyperparameters, and future research could explore the impact of different teacher models, as well as alternative loss functions. Knowledge distillation could also be extended to transformer-based models. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/FABallemand/PRIM .

- **Summary**: Decomposing an image into its intrinsic photometric factors--shading and reflectance--is a long-standing challenge due to the lack of extensive ground-truth data for real-world scenes. Recent methods rely on synthetic data or sparse annotations for limited indoor and even fewer outdoor scenes. We introduce a novel training-free approach for intrinsic image decomposition using only a pair of visible and thermal images. We leverage the principle that light not reflected from an opaque surface is absorbed and detected as heat by a thermal camera. This allows us to relate the ordinalities between visible and thermal image intensities to the ordinalities of shading and reflectance, which can densely self-supervise an optimizing neural network to recover shading and reflectance. We perform quantitative evaluations with known reflectance and shading under natural and artificial lighting, and qualitative experiments across diverse outdoor scenes. The results demonstrate superior performance over recent learning-based models and point toward a scalable path to curating real-world ordinal supervision, previously infeasible via manual labeling.

- **Summary**: Compressed video quality enhancement (CVQE) is crucial for improving user experience with lossy video codecs like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC. While deep learning based CVQE has driven significant progress, existing surveys still suffer from limitations: lack of systematic classification linking methods to specific standards and artifacts, insufficient comparative analysis of architectural paradigms across coding types, and underdeveloped benchmarking practices. To address these gaps, this paper presents three key contributions. First, it introduces a novel taxonomy classifying CVQE methods across architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature utilization. Second, it proposes a unified benchmarking framework integrating modern compression protocols and standard test sequences for fair multi-criteria evaluation. Third, it provides a systematic analysis of the critical trade-offs between reconstruction performance and computational complexity observed in state-of-the-art methods and highlighting promising directions for future research. This comprehensive review aims to establish a foundation for consistent assessment and informed model selection in CVQE research and deployment.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation, a key task in computer vision with broad applications in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced substantially with deep learning. Nevertheless, current approaches remain vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged, providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES, where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding.

- **Summary**: Arbitrary resolution image generation provides a consistent visual experience across devices, having extensive applications for producers and consumers. Current diffusion models increase computational demand quadratically with resolution, causing 4K image generation delays over 100 seconds. To solve this, we explore the second generation upon the latent diffusion models, where the fixed latent generated by diffusion models is regarded as the content representation and we propose to decode arbitrary resolution images with a compact generated latent using a one-step generator. Thus, we present the \textbf{InfGen}, replacing the VAE decoder with the new generator, for generating images at any resolution from a fixed-size latent without retraining the diffusion models, which simplifies the process, reducing computational complexity and can be applied to any model using the same latent space. Experiments show InfGen is capable of improving many models into the arbitrary high-resolution era while cutting 4K image generation time to under 10 seconds.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that causes memory loss and cognitive decline. While there has been extensive research in applying deep learning models to Alzheimer's prediction tasks, these models remain limited by lack of available labeled data, poor generalization across datasets, and inflexibility to varying numbers of input scans and time intervals between scans. In this study, we adapt three state-of-the-art temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches for 3D brain MRI analysis, and add novel extensions designed to handle variable-length inputs and learn robust spatial features. We aggregate four publicly available datasets comprising 3,161 patients for pre-training, and show the performance of our model across multiple Alzheimer's prediction tasks including diagnosis classification, conversion detection, and future conversion prediction. Importantly, our SSL model implemented with temporal order prediction and contrastive learning outperforms supervised learning on six out of seven downstream tasks. It demonstrates adaptability and generalizability across tasks and number of input images with varying time intervals, highlighting its capacity for robust performance across clinical applications. We release our code and model publicly at https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/SSL-AD.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a training-free framework for vision-and-language navigation (VLN). Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for discrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator environments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in real-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous environments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint optimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The constraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint solving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we construct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial relationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed into a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges, which are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph constraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint solver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's navigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple solutions, we construct a navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world experiments to show that our framework can effectively generalize to new environments and instruction sets, paving the way for a more robust and autonomous navigation framework.
