- **Summary**: The FungiCLEF 2025 competition addresses the challenge of automatic fungal species recognition using realistic, field-collected observational data. Accurate identification tools support both mycologists and citizen scientists, greatly enhancing large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Effective recognition systems in this context must handle highly imbalanced class distributions and provide reliable performance even when very few training samples are available for many species, especially rare and under-documented taxa that are often missing from standard training sets. According to competition organizers, about 20\% of all verified fungi observations, representing nearly 20,000 instances, are associated with these rarely recorded species. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks, which enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification. Our prototypical network approach exceeds the competition baseline by more than 30 percentage points in Recall@5 on both the public (PB) and private (PR) leaderboards. This demonstrates strong potential for accurately identifying both common and rare fungal species, supporting the main objectives of FungiCLEF 2025.

- **Summary**: Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology, where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering, within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones. This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles. Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).

- **Summary**: Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field, recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically autoregressive and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in climate science, where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with. In this work, we explore the impact of curated data selection on these autoregressive diffusion models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies and show that a simple time stratified sampling approach achieves performance similar to or better than full-data training. Notably, it outperforms the full-data model on certain metrics and performs only slightly worse on others while using only 20% of the training data. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for weather forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.

- **Summary**: We establish the first information-theoretic limits for multimodal retrieval. Casting ranking as lossy source coding, we derive a single-letter rate-distortion function $R(D)$ for reciprocal-rank distortion and prove a converse bound that splits into a modality-balanced term plus a skew penalty $\kappa\,\Delta H$ capturing entropy imbalance and cross-modal redundancy. We then construct an explicit entropy-weighted stochastic quantizer with an adaptive, per-modality temperature decoder; a Blahut-Arimoto argument shows this scheme achieves distortion within $O(n^{-1})$ of $R(D)$ using $n$ training triples. A VC-type analysis yields the first finite-sample excess-risk bound whose complexity scales sub-linearly in both the number of modalities and the entropy gap. Experiments on controlled Gaussian mixtures and Flickr30k confirm that our adaptive codes sit within two percentage points of the theoretical frontier, while fixed-temperature and naive CLIP baselines lag significantly. Taken together, our results give a principled answer to "how many bits per query are necessary" for high-quality multimodal retrieval and provide design guidance for entropy-aware contrastive objectives, continual-learning retrievers, and retrieval-augmented generators.

- **Summary**: Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments. Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech, UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in organoid models have revolutionized the study of human kidney disease mechanisms and drug discovery by enabling scalable, cost-effective research without the need for animal sacrifice. Here, we present a kidney organoid platform optimized for efficient screening in polycystic kidney disease (PKD). While these systems generate rich spatial-temporal microscopy video datasets, current manual approaches to analysis remain limited to coarse classifications (e.g., hit vs. non-hit), often missing valuable pixel-level and longitudinal information. To help overcome this bottleneck, we developed Organoid Tracker, a graphical user interface (GUI) platform designed with a modular plugin architecture, which empowers researchers to extract detailed, quantitative metrics without programming expertise. Built on the cutting-edge vision foundation model Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), Organoid Tracker enables zero-shot segmentation and automated analysis of spatial-temporal microscopy videos. It quantifies key metrics such as cyst formation rate, growth velocity, and morphological changes, while generating comprehensive reports. By providing an extensible, open-source framework, Organoid Tracker offers a powerful solution for improving and accelerating research in kidney development, PKD modeling, and therapeutic discovery. The platform is publicly available as open-source software at https://github.com/hrlblab/OrganoidTracker.

- **Summary**: This report outlines our approach using vision language model systems for the Driving with Language track of the CVPR 2024 Autonomous Grand Challenge. We have exclusively utilized the DriveLM-nuScenes dataset for training our models. Our systems are built on the LLaVA models, which we enhanced through fine-tuning with the LoRA and DoRA methods. Additionally, we have integrated depth information from open-source depth estimation models to enrich the training and inference processes. For inference, particularly with multiple-choice and yes/no questions, we adopted a Chain-of-Thought reasoning approach to improve the accuracy of the results. This comprehensive methodology enabled us to achieve a top score of 0.7799 on the validation set leaderboard, ranking 1st on the leaderboard.

- **Summary**: We present a robust multi-modal framework for predicting traversability costmaps for planetary rovers. Our model fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce a bird's-eye-view (BEV) terrain costmap, trained self-supervised using IMU-derived labels. Key updates include a DINOv3-based image encoder, FiLM-based sensor fusion, and an optimization loss combining Huber and smoothness terms. Experimental ablations (removing image color, occluding inputs, adding noise) show only minor changes in MAE/MSE (e.g. MAE increases from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR is sparsified), indicating that geometry dominates the learned cost and the model is highly robust. We attribute the small performance differences to the IMU labeling primarily reflecting terrain geometry rather than semantics and to limited data diversity. Unlike prior work claiming large gains, we emphasize our contributions: (1) a high-fidelity, reproducible simulation environment; (2) a self-supervised IMU-based labeling pipeline; and (3) a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction model. We discuss limitations and future work such as domain generalization and dataset expansion.

- **Summary**: Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) reconstruction requires recovering both the spatial distribution of acoustic scatterers and their direction-dependent response. Time-domain backprojection is the most common 3D SAS reconstruction algorithm, but it does not model directionality and can suffer from sampling limitations, aliasing, and occlusion. Prior neural volumetric methods applied to synthetic aperture sonar treat each voxel as an isotropic scattering density, not modeling anisotropic returns. We introduce SH-SAS, an implicit neural representation that expresses the complex acoustic scattering field as a set of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients. A multi-resolution hash encoder feeds a lightweight MLP that outputs complex SH coefficients up to a specified degree L. The zeroth-order coefficient acts as an isotropic scattering field, which also serves as the density term, while higher orders compactly capture directional scattering with minimal parameter overhead. Because the model predicts the complex amplitude for any transmit-receive baseline, training is performed directly from 1-D time-of-flight signals without the need to beamform intermediate images for supervision. Across synthetic and real SAS (both in-air and underwater) benchmarks, results show that SH-SAS performs better in terms of 3D reconstruction quality and geometric metrics than previous methods.



### End-to-End Visual Autonomous Parking via Control-Aided Attention

- **Summary**: Precise parking requires an end-to-end system where perception adaptively provides policy-relevant details-especially in critical areas where fine control decisions are essential. End-to-end learning offers a unified framework by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches lack effective synergy between perception and control. We find that transformer-based self-attention, when used alone, tends to produce unstable and temporally inconsistent spatial attention, which undermines the reliability of downstream policy decisions over time. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an end-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the learning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA) mechanism. For the first time, we train such an attention module in a self-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs instead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages the attention to focus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather than merely minimizing the training loss-a shift we demonstrate leads to a more robust and generalizable policy. To further enhance stability, CAA-Policy integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction as an auxiliary task, and introduces a separately trained motion prediction module to robustly track the target spot over time. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show that \titlevariable~consistently surpasses both the end-to-end learning baseline and the modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

- **Summary**: Generating high-quality 360{\deg} panoramic videos remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

- **Summary**: The performance of hyperspectral unmixing may be constrained by low spatial resolution, which can be enhanced using super-resolution in a multitask learning way. However, integrating super-resolution and unmixing directly may suffer two challenges: Task affinity is not verified, and the convergence of unmixing is not guaranteed. To address the above issues, in this paper, we provide theoretical analysis and propose super-resolution guided multi-task learning method for hyperspectral unmixing (SMILE). The provided theoretical analysis validates feasibility of multitask learning way and verifies task affinity, which consists of relationship and existence theorems by proving the positive guidance of super-resolution. The proposed framework generalizes positive information from super-resolution to unmixing by learning both shared and specific representations. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence, we provide the accessibility theorem by proving the optimal solution of unmixing. The major contributions of SMILE include providing progressive theoretical support, and designing a new framework for unmixing under the guidance of super-resolution. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have substantiate the usefulness of our work.

- **Summary**: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing (MTHU) aims to model variable endmembers and dynamical abundances, which emphasizes the critical temporal information. However, existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency, thus fail to capture the dynamical material evolution. Motivated by the ability of copula theory in modeling dependency structure explicitly, in this paper, we propose a copula-guided temporal dependency method (Cog-TD) for multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing. Cog-TD defines new mathematical model, constructs copula-guided framework and provides two key modules with theoretical support. The mathematical model provides explicit formulations for MTHU problem definition, which describes temporal dependency structure by incorporating copula theory. The copula-guided framework is constructed for utilizing copula function, which estimates dynamical endmembers and abundances with temporal dependency. The key modules consist of copula function estimation and temporal dependency guidance, which computes and employs temporal information to guide unmixing process. Moreover, the theoretical support demonstrates that estimated copula function is valid and the represented temporal dependency exists in hyperspectral images. The major contributions of this paper include redefining MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposing a copula-guided framework, developing two key modules and providing theoretical support. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Timely assessment of structural damage is critical for disaster response and recovery. However, most prior work in natural disaster analysis relies on 2D imagery, which lacks depth, suffers from occlusions, and provides limited spatial context. 3D semantic segmentation offers a richer alternative, but existing 3D benchmarks focus mainly on urban or indoor scenes, with little attention to disaster-affected areas. To address this gap, we present 3DAeroRelief--the first 3D benchmark dataset specifically designed for post-disaster assessment. Collected using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over hurricane-damaged regions, the dataset features dense 3D point clouds reconstructed via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo techniques. Semantic annotations were produced through manual 2D labeling and projected into 3D space. Unlike existing datasets, 3DAeroRelief captures 3D large-scale outdoor environments with fine-grained structural damage in real-world disaster contexts. UAVs enable affordable, flexible, and safe data collection in hazardous areas, making them particularly well-suited for emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of 3DAeroRelief, we evaluate several state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models on the dataset to highlight both the challenges and opportunities of 3D scene understanding in disaster response. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D vision systems in real-world applications for post-disaster scenarios.



### Filling the Gaps: A Multitask Hybrid Multiscale Generative Framework for Missing Modality in Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation

- **Summary**: Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models' operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness (HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3) Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet, outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and Potsdam). Source code is made available.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in clinical practice due to its cost-effectiveness, mobility, and safety. However, current AI research often treats disease prediction and tissue segmentation as two separate tasks and their model requires substantial computational overhead. In such a situation, we introduce UltraUPConvNet, a computationally efficient universal framework designed for both ultrasound image classification and segmentation. Trained on a large-scale dataset containing more than 9,700 annotations across seven different anatomical regions, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on certain datasets with lower computational overhead.

- **Summary**: We propose a pipeline to extract and reconstruct dynamic 3D smoke assets from a single in-the-wild video, and further integrate interactive simulation for smoke design and editing. Recent developments in 3D vision have significantly improved reconstructing and rendering fluid dynamics, supporting realistic and temporally consistent view synthesis. However, current fluid reconstructions rely heavily on carefully controlled clean lab environments, whereas real-world videos captured in the wild are largely underexplored. We pinpoint three key challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos and design targeted techniques, including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos. Our method not only outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos), but also enables diverse and realistic editing of fluid dynamics by simulating our smoke assets. We provide our models, data, and 4D smoke assets at [https://autumnyq.github.io/WildSmoke](https://autumnyq.github.io/WildSmoke).

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables fast, high-quality novel view synthesis but typically relies on densification followed by pruning to optimize the number of Gaussians. Existing mask-based pruning, such as MaskGS, regularizes the global mean of the mask, which is misaligned with the local per-pixel (per-ray) reconstruction loss that determines image quality along individual camera rays. This paper introduces SVR-GS, a spatially variant regularizer that renders a per-pixel spatial mask from each Gaussian's effective contribution along the ray, thereby applying sparsity pressure where it matters: on low-importance Gaussians. We explore three spatial-mask aggregation strategies, implement them in CUDA, and conduct a gradient analysis to motivate our final design. Extensive experiments on Tanks\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed SVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\(\times\) compared to MaskGS and 5.63\(\times\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR drops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster, and more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time applications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception.

- **Summary**: Deploying visual reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world manipulation is often hindered by camera viewpoint changes. A policy trained from a fixed front-facing camera may fail when the camera is shifted--an unavoidable situation in real-world settings where sensor placement is hard to manage appropriately. Existing methods often rely on precise camera calibration or struggle with large perspective changes. To address these limitations, we propose ManiVID-3D, a novel 3D RL architecture designed for robotic manipulation, which learns view-invariant representations through self-supervised disentangled feature learning. The framework incorporates ViewNet, a lightweight yet effective module that automatically aligns point cloud observations from arbitrary viewpoints into a unified spatial coordinate system without the need for extrinsic calibration. Additionally, we develop an efficient GPU-accelerated batch rendering module capable of processing over 5000 frames per second, enabling large-scale training for 3D visual RL at unprecedented speeds. Extensive evaluation across 10 simulated and 5 real-world tasks demonstrates that our approach achieves a 44.7% higher success rate than state-of-the-art methods under viewpoint variations while using 80% fewer parameters. The system's robustness to severe perspective changes and strong sim-to-real performance highlight the effectiveness of learning geometrically consistent representations for scalable robotic manipulation in unstructured environments.

- **Summary**: Effective reef monitoring requires the quantification of coral growth via accurate volumetric and surface area estimates, which is a challenging task due to the complex morphology of corals. We propose a novel, lightweight, and scalable learning framework that addresses this challenge by predicting the 3D volume and surface area of coral-like objects from 2D multi-view RGB images. Our approach utilizes a pre-trained module (VGGT) to extract dense point maps from each view; these maps are merged into a unified point cloud and enriched with per-view confidence scores. The resulting cloud is fed to two parallel DGCNN decoder heads, which jointly output the volume and the surface area of the coral, as well as their corresponding confidence estimate. To enhance prediction stability and provide uncertainty estimates, we introduce a composite loss function based on Gaussian negative log-likelihood in both real and log domains. Our method achieves competitive accuracy and generalizes well to unseen morphologies. This framework paves the way for efficient and scalable coral geometry estimation directly from a sparse set of images, with potential applications in coral growth analysis and reef monitoring.

- **Summary**: As intelligent transportation systems advance, traffic video understanding plays an increasingly pivotal role in comprehensive scene perception and causal analysis. Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone, our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario generalization capabilities.

- **Summary**: 3D reconstruction technology generates three-dimensional representations of real-world objects, scenes, or environments using sensor data such as 2D images, with extensive applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality systems. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques based on 2D images typically relies on RGB spectral information. With advances in sensor technology, additional spectral bands beyond RGB have been increasingly incorporated into 3D reconstruction workflows. Existing methods that integrate these expanded spectral data often suffer from expensive scheme prices, low accuracy and poor geometric features. Three - dimensional reconstruction based on NeRF can effectively address the various issues in current multispectral 3D reconstruction methods, producing high - precision and high - quality reconstruction results. However, currently, NeRF and some improved models such as NeRFacto are trained on three - band data and cannot take into account the multi - band information. To address this problem, we propose Multispectral-NeRF, an enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF that can effectively integrates multispectral information. Our technical contributions comprise threefold modifications: Expanding hidden layer dimensionality to accommodate 6-band spectral inputs; Redesigning residual functions to optimize spectral discrepancy calculations between reconstructed and reference images; Adapting data compression modules to address the increased bit-depth requirements of multispectral imagery. Experimental results confirm that Multispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while accurately preserving the original scenes' spectral characteristics.

- **Summary**: Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task in autonomous driving systems, assessing voxel-level geometry and semantics for holistic scene perception. While existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC methods have achieved considerable progress, they struggle to capture physical regularities for realistic geometric details. On the other hand, neural reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS demonstrate superior physical awareness, but suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence when handling large-scale, complex autonomous driving scenes, leading to inferior semantic accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-PHysical Engaged REpresentation (SPHERE) for camera-based SSC, which integrates voxel and Gaussian representations for joint exploitation of semantic and physical information. First, the Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) module leverages dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as anchors to guide efficient Gaussian initialization. Then, the Physical-aware Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) module incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry consistency through focal distribution alignment, generating SSC results with realistic details. Extensive experiments and analyses on the popular SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of SPHERE.

- **Summary**: Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse. Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of both the stego and recovery images. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Rss1124/StegOT.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) models to automatically classify skin lesions from dermatology images have shown promising performance but also susceptibility to bias by skin tone. The most common way of representing skin tone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has been criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for lighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact (on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST scale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions using FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when training models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and 5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data compared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the granularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a detrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the granularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the question marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the FST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in fair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better represents the diversity of human skin tones.

- **Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which links language instructions to perception and control in the real world, is a core capability of embodied robots. Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However, existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and 18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination while using only egocentric inputs.

- **Summary**: Accurate tree segmentation is a key step in extracting individual tree metrics from forest laser scans, and is essential to understanding ecosystem functions in carbon cycling and beyond. Over the past decade, tree segmentation algorithms have advanced rapidly due to developments in AI. However existing, public, 3D forest datasets are not large enough to build robust tree segmentation systems. Motivated by the success of synthetic data in other domains such as self-driving, we investigate whether similar approaches can help with tree segmentation. In place of expensive field data collection and annotation, we use synthetic data during pretraining, and then require only minimal, real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.   We have developed a new synthetic data generation pipeline to do this for forest vision tasks, integrating advances in game-engines with physics-based LiDAR simulation. As a result, we have produced a comprehensive, diverse, annotated 3D forest dataset on an unprecedented scale. Extensive experiments with a state-of-the-art tree segmentation algorithm and a popular real dataset show that our synthetic data can substantially reduce the need for labelled real data. After fine-tuning on just a single, real, forest plot of less than 0.1 hectare, the pretrained model achieves segmentations that are competitive with a model trained on the full scale real data. We have also identified critical factors for successful use of synthetic data: physics, diversity, and scale, paving the way for more robust 3D forest vision systems in the future. Our data generation pipeline and the resulting dataset are available at https://github.com/yihshe/CAMP3D.git.

- **Summary**: In the realm of image generation, the quest for realism and customization has never been more pressing. While existing methods like concept sliders have made strides, they often falter when it comes to no-AIGC images, particularly images captured in real world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Beyond Sliders, an innovative framework that integrates GANs and diffusion models to facilitate sophisticated image manipulation across diverse image categories. Improved upon concept sliders, our method refines the image through fine grained guidance both textual and visual in an adversarial manner, leading to a marked enhancement in image quality and realism. Extensive experimental validation confirms the robustness and versatility of Beyond Sliders across a spectrum of applications.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) remains highly sensitive to geometric variability, where objects appear under arbitrary orientations, scales, and perspective distortions. While equivariant architectures address this issue, they typically require substantial computational resources and restrict the hypothesis space. We revisit Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) as a canonicalization tool for transformer-based vision pipelines, emphasizing their flexibility, backbone-agnostic nature, and lack of architectural constraints. We propose a probabilistic, component-wise extension that improves robustness. Specifically, we decompose affine transformations into rotation, scaling, and shearing, and regress each component under geometric constraints using a shared localization encoder. To capture uncertainty, we model each component with a Gaussian variational posterior and perform sampling-based canonicalization during inference.A novel component-wise alignment loss leverages augmentation parameters to guide spatial alignment. Experiments on challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently improves robustness compared to other STNs.

- **Summary**: Cattle identification is critical for efficient livestock farming management, currently reliant on radio-frequency identification (RFID) ear tags. However, RFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and vulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric identification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has emerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated success in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But deep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data availability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions that require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle identification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This model offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning from few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been rigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle identification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores.

- **Summary**: Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which involves learning to generalize using only a few data samples, has demonstrated promising and superior performances to ordinary CNN methods. While Bayesian based estimation approaches using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence have shown improvements, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks and natural noises. We introduce ANROT-HELANet, an Adversarially and Naturally RObusT Hellinger Aggregation Network that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in FSL robustness and performance. Our approach implements an adversarially and naturally robust Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation scheme, demonstrating resilience to adversarial perturbations up to $\epsilon=0.30$ and Gaussian noise up to $\sigma=0.30$. The network achieves substantial improvements across benchmark datasets, including gains of 1.20\% and 1.40\% for 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios on miniImageNet respectively. We introduce a novel Hellinger Similarity contrastive loss function that generalizes cosine similarity contrastive loss for variational few-shot inference scenarios. Our approach also achieves superior image reconstruction quality with a FID score of 2.75, outperforming traditional VAE (3.43) and WAE (3.38) approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on four few-shot benchmarked datasets verify that ANROT-HELANet's combination of Hellinger distance-based feature aggregation, attention mechanisms, and our novel loss function establishes new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness against both adversarial and natural perturbations. Our code repository will be available at https://github.com/GreedYLearner1146/ANROT-HELANet/tree/main.

- **Summary**: This paper presents MIS-LSTM, a hybrid framework that joins CNN encoders with an LSTM sequence model for sleep quality and stress prediction at the day level from multimodal lifelog data. Continuous sensor streams are first partitioned into N-hour blocks and rendered as multi-channel images, while sparse discrete events are encoded with a dedicated 1D-CNN. A Convolutional Block Attention Module fuses the two modalities into refined block embeddings, which an LSTM then aggregates to capture long-range temporal dependencies. To further boost robustness, we introduce UALRE, an uncertainty-aware ensemble that overrides lowconfidence majority votes with high-confidence individual predictions. Experiments on the 2025 ETRI Lifelog Challenge dataset show that Our base MISLSTM achieves Macro-F1 0.615; with the UALRE ensemble, the score improves to 0.647, outperforming strong LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines. Ablations confirm (i) the superiority of multi-channel over stacked-vertical imaging, (ii) the benefit of a 4-hour block granularity, and (iii) the efficacy of modality-specific discrete encoding.

- **Summary**: Person Re-Identification (ReID) has several challenges in real-world surveillance systems due to clothing changes (CCReID) and the need for maintaining continual learning (LReID). Previous existing methods either develop models specifically for one application, which is mostly a same-cloth (SC) setting or treat CCReID as its own separate sub-problem. In this work, we will introduce the LReID-Hybrid task with the goal of developing a model to achieve both SC and CC while learning in a continual setting. Mismatched representations and forgetting from one task to the next are significant issues, we address this with CMLReID, a CLIP-based framework composed of two novel tasks: (1) Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) that generates adaptive prompts, and also incorporates context to align richly multi-grained visual cues with semantic text space; and (2) Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection (AKFP) which produces robust SC/CC prototypes through the use of a dual-path learner that aligns features with our Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss. Experiments performed on a wide range of datasets and illustrate that CMLReID outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with strong robustness and generalization despite clothing variations and a sophisticated process of sequential learning.

- **Summary**: GUI agents built on LVLMs are increasingly used to interact with websites. However, their exposure to open-world content makes them vulnerable to Environmental Injection Attacks (EIAs) that hijack agent behavior via webpage elements. Many recent studies assume the attacker to be a regular user who can only upload a single trigger image, which is more realistic than earlier assumptions of website-level administrative control. However, these works still fall short of realism: (1) the trigger's position and surrounding context remain largely fixed between training and testing, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real webpages and (2) the trigger often occupies an unrealistically large area, whereas real-world images are typically small. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we introduce a more realistic threat model where the attacker is a regular user and the trigger image is small and embedded within a dynamically changing environment. As a result, existing attacks prove largely ineffective under this threat model.   To better expose the vulnerabilities of GUI agents, we propose Chameleon, an attack framework with two main novelties. The first is LLM-Driven Environment Simulation, which automatically generates diverse and high-fidelity webpage simulations. The second is Attention Black Hole, which transforms attention weights into explicit supervisory signals that guide the agent's focus toward the trigger region. We evaluate Chameleon on 6 realistic websites and 4 representative LVLM-powered GUI agents, where it significantly outperforms existing methods. Ablation studies confirm that both novelties are critical to performance.

- **Summary**: Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task. Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks tend to memorize noisy labels, severely degrading their generalization performance. Although Mixup has demonstrated effectiveness in improving generalization and robustness, existing Mixup-based methods typically perform indiscriminate mixing without principled guidance on sample selection and mixing strategy, inadvertently propagating noisy supervision. To overcome these limitations, we propose SelectMix, a confidence-guided mixing framework explicitly tailored for noisy labels. SelectMix first identifies potentially noisy or ambiguous samples through confidence based mismatch analysis using K-fold cross-validation, then selectively blends identified uncertain samples with confidently predicted peers from their potential classes. Furthermore, SelectMix employs soft labels derived from all classes involved in the mixing process, ensuring the labels accurately represent the composition of the mixed samples, thus aligning supervision signals closely with the actual mixed inputs. Through extensive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on multiple synthetic (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world benchmark datasets (CIFAR-N, MNIST and Clothing1M), we demonstrate that SelectMix consistently outperforms strong baseline methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness in learning with noisy labels.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of synthetic dataset generation techniques, evaluating the quality of synthetic data has become a critical research focus. Robust evaluation not only drives innovations in data generation methods but also guides researchers in optimizing the utilization of these synthetic resources. However, current evaluation studies for synthetic datasets remain limited, lacking a universally accepted standard framework. To address this, this paper proposes a novel evaluation framework integrating generalized cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning principles, enabling generalizable and comparable assessments of synthetic dataset quality. The framework involves training task-specific models (e.g., YOLOv5s) on both synthetic datasets and multiple real-world benchmarks (e.g., KITTI, BDD100K), forming a cross-performance matrix. Following normalization, a Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) Matrix is constructed to quantify domain transferability. The framework introduces two key metrics. One measures the simulation quality by quantifying the similarity between synthetic data and real-world datasets, while another evaluates the transfer quality by assessing the diversity and coverage of synthetic data across various real-world scenarios. Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed framework and metrics in assessing synthetic data fidelity. This scalable and quantifiable evaluation solution overcomes traditional limitations, providing a principled approach to guide synthetic dataset optimization in artificial intelligence research.

- **Summary**: Image data captured outdoors often exhibit unbounded scenes and unconstrained, varying lighting conditions, making it challenging to decompose them into geometry, reflectance, and illumination. Recent works have focused on achieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key limitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of NeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result in inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS, a two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor scenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular normal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and accurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS then decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting model. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing a spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency components of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via Spherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight comprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons demonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting outdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting accuracy and rendering efficiency.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capability.

- **Summary**: Unaligned Scene Change Detection aims to detect scene changes between image pairs captured at different times without assuming viewpoint alignment. To handle viewpoint variations, current methods rely solely on 2D visual cues to establish cross-image correspondence to assist change detection. However, large viewpoint changes can alter visual observations, causing appearance-based matching to drift or fail. Additionally, supervision limited to 2D change masks from small-scale SCD datasets restricts the learning of generalizable multi-view knowledge, making it difficult to reliably identify visual overlaps and handle occlusions. This lack of explicit geometric reasoning represents a critical yet overlooked limitation. In this work, we are the first to leverage geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address the core challenges of unaligned SCD, including reliable identification of visual overlaps, robust correspondence establishment, and explicit occlusion detection. Building on these priors, we propose a training-free framework that integrates them with the powerful representations of a visual foundation model to enable reliable change detection under viewpoint misalignment. Through extensive evaluation on the PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves superior and robust performance. Our code will be released at https://github.com/ZilingLiu/GeoSCD.

- **Summary**: We propose UnLoc, an efficient data-driven solution for sequential camera localization within floorplans. Floorplan data is readily available, long-term persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance. We address key limitations of recent methods, such as the lack of uncertainty modeling in depth predictions and the necessity for custom depth networks trained for each environment. We introduce a novel probabilistic model that incorporates uncertainty estimation, modeling depth predictions as explicit probability distributions. By leveraging off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models, we eliminate the need to rely on per-environment-trained depth networks, enhancing generalization to unseen spaces. We evaluate UnLoc on large-scale synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Notably, we achieve $2.7$ times higher localization recall on long sequences (100 frames) and $16.7$ times higher on short ones (15 frames) than the state of the art on the challenging LaMAR HGE dataset.

- **Summary**: Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT).   It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and identity switches.   The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of the most commonly used methods in MOT.   However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are mismatched and objects move in non-stationary.   In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion estimation of MOT.   In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps.   First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state vectors to encode independent semantic information.   Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between heterogeneous-semantic elements.   To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several open-source MOT datasets.   Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing learning-aided filters.

- **Summary**: Medical Image Computing (MIC) is a broad research topic covering both pixel-wise (e.g., segmentation, registration) and image-wise (e.g., classification, regression) vision tasks. Effective analysis demands models that capture both global long-range context and local subtle visual characteristics, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency modeling. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by intrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to the high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot process high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before downsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling fine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details. Concurrently, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based visual models are recognized as computation/memory-efficient alternatives in modeling long-range visual dependency but have yet to be widely investigated in the MIC community. This doctoral research advances deep learning-based MIC by investigating effective long-range visual dependency modeling. It first presents innovative use of transformers for both pixel- and image-wise medical vision tasks. The focus then shifts to MLPs, pioneeringly developing MLP-based visual models to capture fine-grained long-range visual dependency in medical images. Extensive experiments confirm the critical role of long-range dependency modeling in MIC and reveal a key finding: MLPs provide feasibility in modeling finer-grained long-range dependency among higher-resolution medical features containing enriched anatomical/pathological details. This finding establishes MLPs as a superior paradigm over transformers/CNNs, consistently enhancing performance across various medical vision tasks and paving the way for next-generation medical vision backbones.

- **Summary**: Long-wave infrared radiation captured by a thermal camera consists of two components: (a) light from the environment reflected or transmitted by a surface, and (b) light emitted by the surface after undergoing heat transport through the object and exchanging heat with the surrounding environment. Separating these components is essential for understanding object properties such as emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape. Previous thermography studies often assume that only one component is dominant (e.g., in welding) or that the second component is constant and can be subtracted. However, in near-ambient conditions, which are most relevant to computer vision applications, both components are typically comparable in magnitude and vary over time. We introduce the first method that separates reflected and emitted components of light in videos captured by two thermal cameras with different spectral sensitivities. We derive a dual-band thermal image formation model and develop algorithms to estimate the surface's emissivity and its time-varying temperature while isolating a dynamic background. We quantitatively evaluate our approach using carefully calibrated emissivities for a range of materials and show qualitative results on complex everyday scenes, such as a glass filled with hot liquid and people moving in the background.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) conventionally relies on the instance consistency paradigm, assuming that different views of the same image can be treated as positive pairs. However, this assumption breaks down for non-iconic data, where different views may contain distinct objects or semantic information. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SSL when instance consistency is not guaranteed. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that SSL can still learn meaningful representations even when positive pairs lack strict instance consistency. Furthermore, our analysis further reveals that increasing view diversity, by enforcing zero overlapping or using smaller crop scales, can enhance downstream performance on classification and dense prediction tasks. However, excessive diversity is found to reduce effectiveness, suggesting an optimal range for view diversity. To quantify this, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as an estimator to measure mutual information between views, finding that moderate EMD values correlate with improved SSL learning, providing insights for future SSL framework design. We validate our findings across a range of settings, highlighting their robustness and applicability on diverse data sources.

- **Summary**: This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalized medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image classification but remain vulnerable to common corruptions that humans handle with ease. A key reason for this fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global object shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we propose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage shape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an auxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and low-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency textures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure the feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations. Evaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption robustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware, resilient representations.

- **Summary**: Video detailed captioning aims to generate comprehensive video descriptions to facilitate video understanding. Recently, most efforts in the video detailed captioning community have been made towards a local-to-global paradigm, which first generates local captions from video clips and then summarizes them into a global caption. However, we find this paradigm leads to less detailed and contextual-inconsistent captions, which can be attributed to (1) no mechanism to ensure fine-grained captions, and (2) weak interaction between local and global captions. To remedy the above two issues, we propose GLaVE-Cap, a Global-Local aligned framework with Vision Expert integration for Captioning, which consists of two core modules: TrackFusion enables comprehensive local caption generation, by leveraging vision experts to acquire cross-frame visual prompts, coupled with a dual-stream structure; while CaptionBridge establishes a local-global interaction, by using global context to guide local captioning, and adaptively summarizing local captions into a coherent global caption. Besides, we construct GLaVE-Bench, a comprehensive video captioning benchmark featuring 5X more queries per video than existing benchmarks, covering diverse visual dimensions to facilitate reliable evaluation. We further provide a training dataset GLaVE-1.2M containing 16K high-quality fine-grained video captions and 1.2M related question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that our GLaVE-Cap achieves state-of-the-art performance. Besides, the ablation studies and student model analyses further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and the contribution of GLaVE-1.2M to the video understanding community. The source code, model weights, benchmark, and dataset will be open-sourced.

- **Summary**: Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional (3-D) skin surface reconstruction offers promise for objective and quantitative dermatological assessment, but no portable, high-resolution device exists that has been validated and used for depth reconstruction across various body locations. We present a compact 3-D skin reconstruction probe based on GelSight tactile imaging with a custom elastic gel and a learning-based reconstruction algorithm for micron-level wrinkle height estimation. Our probe, integrated into a handheld probe with force sensing for consistent contact, achieves a mean absolute error of 12.55 micron on wrinkle-like test objects. In a study with 15 participants without skin disorders, we provide the first validated wrinkle depth metrics across multiple body regions. We further demonstrate statistically significant reductions in wrinkle height at three locations following over-the-counter moisturizer application. Our work offers a validated tool for clinical and cosmetic skin analysis, with potential applications in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and skincare efficacy evaluation.

While recent State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba have shown promise through input-dependent selectivity on three key parameters, the critical forget-gate ($\textbf{A}$ matrix) controlling temporal memory remains static. We address this limitation by introducing a mixture of experts approach that dynamically selects contextually relevant $\textbf{A}$ matrices based on input features, enhancing representational capacity without sacrificing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101 datasets demonstrate that MixANT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation settings. Our results highlight the importance of input-dependent forget-gate mechanisms for reliable prediction of human behavior in diverse real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: In real world clinical environments, training and applying deep learning models on multi-modal medical imaging data often struggles with partially incomplete data. Standard approaches either discard missing samples, require imputation or repurpose dropout learning schemes, limiting robustness and generalizability. To address this, we propose a hypernetwork-based method that dynamically generates task-specific classification models conditioned on the set of available modalities. Instead of training a fixed model, a hypernetwork learns to predict the parameters of a task model adapted to available modalities, enabling training and inference on all samples, regardless of completeness. We compare this approach with (1) models trained only on complete data, (2) state of the art channel dropout methods, and (3) an imputation-based method, using artificially incomplete datasets to systematically analyze robustness to missing modalities. Results demonstrate superior adaptability of our method, outperforming state of the art approaches with an absolute increase in accuracy of up to 8% when trained on a dataset with 25% completeness (75% of training data with missing modalities). By enabling a single model to generalize across all modality configurations, our approach provides an efficient solution for real-world multi-modal medical data analysis.

- **Summary**: Radiance field-based methods have recently been used to reconstruct human avatars, showing that we can significantly downscale the systems needed for creating animated human avatars. Although this progress has been initiated by neural radiance fields, their slow rendering and backward mapping from the observation space to the canonical space have been the main challenges. With Gaussian splatting overcoming both challenges, a new family of approaches has emerged that are faster to train and render, while also straightforward to implement using forward skinning from the canonical to the observation space. However, the linear blend skinning required for the deformation of the Gaussians does not provide valid results for their non-linear rotation properties. To address such artifacts, recent works use mesh properties to rotate the non-linear Gaussian properties or train models to predict corrective offsets. Instead, we propose a weighted rotation blending approach that leverages quaternion averaging. This leads to simpler vertex-based Gaussians that can be efficiently animated and integrated in any engine by only modifying the linear blend skinning technique, and using any Gaussian rasterizer.

- **Summary**: Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models (VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations, generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success compared to baselines.

- **Summary**: Identifying new disease-related patterns in medical imaging data with the help of machine learning enlarges the vocabulary of rec- ognizable findings. This supports diagnostic and prognostic assessment. However, image appearance varies not only due to biological differences, but also due to imaging technology linked to vendors, scanning- or re- construction parameters. The resulting domain shifts impedes data rep- resentation learning strategies and the discovery of biologically mean- ingful cluster appearances. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach to actively learn the domain shift via post-hoc rotation of the data latent space, enabling disentanglement of biological and tech- nical factors. Results on real-world heterogeneous clinical data show- case that the learned disentangled representation leads to stable clus- ters representing tissue-types across different acquisition settings. Clus- ter consistency is improved by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to the entangled representation, outperform- ing four state-of-the-art harmonization methods. When using the clus- ters to quantify tissue composition on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis pa- tients, the learned profiles enhance Cox survival prediction. This indi- cates that the proposed label-free framework facilitates biomarker dis- covery in multi-center routine imaging data.

- **Summary**: Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing a challenge for deep learning models reliant on complete input data. In this work, inspired by MultiMAE [2], we develop a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm for multi-modal, multi-task learning in 3D medical imaging with brain MRIs. Our method treats each MRI sequence as a separate input modality, leveraging a late-fusion-style transformer encoder to integrate multi-sequence information (multi-modal) and individual decoder streams for each modality for multi-task reconstruction. This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich representations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs through cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable encoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and can be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the performance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in downstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement of $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing input sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the strength of this pretraining strategy. The implementation is made available.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers. Video is available at https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ahYgzmEWP.

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a fundamental task in multi-modal perception that aims to integrate complementary structural and textural cues from different spectral domains. In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks such as object detection and scene understanding.
