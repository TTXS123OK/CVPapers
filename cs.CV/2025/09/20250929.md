- **Summary**: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$ and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10 \times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential for general-purpose GUI grounding.

- **Summary**: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at $411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability, we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific regions, thereby fostering clinician trust and reliability in AI-assisted diagnostics.

- **Summary**: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources, and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed and discussed in detail.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9 times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing one-step models. We will release code and models at https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/FastVSR.

- **Summary**: The early and accurate classification of brain tumors is crucial for guiding effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. This study presents BrainFusion, a significant advancement in brain tumor analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by combining fine-tuned convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tumor classification--including VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception--with YOLOv8 for precise tumor localization with bounding boxes. Leveraging the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset, our experiments reveal that the fine-tuned VGG16 model achieves test accuracy of 99.86%, substantially exceeding previous benchmarks. Beyond setting a new accuracy standard, the integration of bounding-box localization and explainable AI techniques further enhances both the clinical interpretability and trustworthiness of the system's outputs. Overall, this approach underscores the transformative potential of deep learning in delivering faster, more reliable diagnoses, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and survival rates.

- **Summary**: Point clouds are widely used representations of 3D data, but determining the visibility of points from a given viewpoint remains a challenging problem due to their sparse nature and lack of explicit connectivity. Traditional methods, such as Hidden Point Removal (HPR), face limitations in computational efficiency, robustness to noise, and handling concave regions or low-density point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visibility determination in point clouds by formulating it as a binary classification task. The core of our network consists of a 3D U-Net that extracts view-independent point-wise features and a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that predicts point visibility using the extracted features and view direction as inputs. The network is trained end-to-end with ground-truth visibility labels generated from rendered 3D models. Our method significantly outperforms HPR in both accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving up to 126 times speedup on large point clouds. Additionally, our network demonstrates robustness to noise and varying point cloud densities and generalizes well to unseen shapes. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on the ShapeNet, ABC Dataset and real-world datasets, showing substantial improvements in visibility accuracy. We also demonstrate the versatility of our method in various applications, including point cloud visualization, surface reconstruction, normal estimation, shadow rendering, and viewpoint optimization.

- **Summary**: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment, reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances comprehensive AIS evaluation.

- **Summary**: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets. Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states, overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets.

- **Summary**: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification, assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value. DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal, manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

- **Summary**: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12 weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models. Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the potential to help with precision medicine.



### Talk in Pieces, See in Whole: Disentangling and Hierarchical Aggregating Representations for Language-based Object Detection

- **Summary**: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects, attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole"). Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of linguistic compositionality.

- **Summary**: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients), meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets. Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test (N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM, Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/- 0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/- 0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps) than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

- **Summary**: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges: maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total score compared to EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA, respectively, compared with the best prior 7B baselines.

- **Summary**: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice, fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8% (11.7M) of its parameters.

- **Summary**: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods, however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static 3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module. An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at: https://zhenliuzju.github.io/huyingdong/Forge4D.

- **Summary**: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on 17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++ achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

- **Summary**: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men and the eighth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has become central to the diagnostic pathway for men at intermediate risk, improving de-tection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) while reducing unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis. However, mpMRI remains limited by false positives, false negatives, and moderate to substantial interobserver agreement. Time-dependent diffusion (TDD) MRI, a novel sequence that enables tissue microstructure characterization, has shown encouraging preclinical performance in distinguishing clinically significant from insignificant PCa. Combining TDD-derived metrics with machine learning may provide robust, zone-specific risk prediction with less dependence on reader training and improved accuracy compared to current standard-of-care. This study protocol out-lines the rationale and describes the prospective evaluation of a home-developed AI-enhanced TDD-MRI software (PROSTDAI) in routine diagnostic care, assessing its added value against PI-RADS v2.1 and validating results against MRI-guided prostate biopsy.

- **Summary**: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties: dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology. External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858) and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models. In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world clinical deployment.

- **Summary**: Real-time dense scene reconstruction during unstable camera motions is crucial for robotics, yet current RGB-D SLAM systems fail when cameras experience large viewpoint changes, fast motions, or sudden shaking. Classical optimization-based methods deliver high accuracy but fail with poor initialization during large motions, while learning-based approaches provide robustness but lack sufficient accuracy for dense reconstruction. We address this challenge through a combination of learning-based initialization with optimization-based refinement. Our method employs a camera pose regression network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames, which serve as reliable starting points for a randomized optimization algorithm that further aligns depth images with the scene geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate promising results: our approach outperforms the best competitor on challenging benchmarks, while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion sequences. The system operates in real-time, showcasing that combining simple and principled techniques can achieve both robustness for unstable motions and accuracy for dense reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation. Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second, action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained: reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code base and model weights will be released later.

- **Summary**: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images, videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS) and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance. Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs (CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an \textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing applications.

- **Summary**: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints, enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation, counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction. However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and 3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging conditions.

- **Summary**: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training, we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals. Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and automated graphics generation.

- **Summary**: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making policy. Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1 (72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis, and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh. OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over 904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24 synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets, advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

- **Summary**: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT (Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student), increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically, our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video representation learning.

- **Summary**: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field. Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction is challenged by slow per-frame optimization, inconsistent motion estimation, and unsustainable storage demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Reconfigurable Continuum Gaussian Stream, dubbed ReCon-GS, a novel storage-aware framework that enables high fidelity online dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time rendering. Specifically, we dynamically allocate multi-level Anchor Gaussians in a density-adaptive fashion to capture inter-frame geometric deformations, thereby decomposing scene motion into compact coarse-to-fine representations. Then, we design a dynamic hierarchy reconfiguration strategy that preserves localized motion expressiveness through on-demand anchor re-hierarchization, while ensuring temporal consistency through intra-hierarchical deformation inheritance that confines transformation priors to their respective hierarchy levels. Furthermore, we introduce a storage-aware optimization mechanism that flexibly adjusts the density of Anchor Gaussians at different hierarchy levels, enabling a controllable trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and memory usage. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, ReCon-GS improves training efficiency by approximately 15% and achieves superior FVV synthesis quality with enhanced robustness and stability. Moreover, at equivalent rendering quality, ReCon-GS slashes memory requirements by over 50% compared to leading state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We introduce a psychologically grounded and artist-informed framework for modeling visual creativity across four domains: Inner, Outer, Imaginative, and Moral Worlds. Drawing on interviews with practicing artists and theories from psychology, we define 12 traits that capture affective, symbolic, cultural, and ethical dimensions of creativity.Using 20k artworks from the SemArt dataset, we annotate images with GPT 4.1 using detailed, theory-aligned prompts, and evaluate the learnability of these traits from CLIP image embeddings. Traits such as Environmental Dialogicity and Redemptive Arc are predicted with high reliability ($R^2 \approx 0.64 - 0.68$), while others like Memory Imprint remain challenging, highlighting the limits of purely visual encoding. Beyond technical metrics, we visualize a "creativity trait-space" and illustrate how it can support interpretable, trait-aware co-creation - e.g., sliding along a Redemptive Arc axis to explore works of adversity and renewal. By linking cultural-aesthetic insights with computational modeling, our work aims not to reduce creativity to numbers, but to offer shared language and interpretable tools for artists, researchers, and AI systems to collaborate meaningfully.

- **Summary**: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this, we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions. Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential for intelligent agriculture.

- **Summary**: Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential indicator of global climate change and one of the most intuitive factors reflecting ocean conditions. Obtaining high-resolution SST data remains challenging due to limitations in physical imaging, and super-resolution via deep neural networks is a promising solution. Recently, Mamba-based approaches leveraging State Space Models (SSM) have demonstrated significant potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. However, their application to SST data super-resolution remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the Wavelet-assisted Mamba Super-Resolution (WMSR) framework for satellite-derived SST data. The WMSR includes two key components: the Low-Frequency State Space Module (LFSSM) and High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HFEM). The LFSSM uses 2D-SSM to capture global information of the input data, and the robust global modeling capabilities of SSM are exploited to preserve the critical temperature information in the low-frequency component. The HFEM employs the pixel difference convolution to match and correct the high-frequency feature, achieving accurate and clear textures. Through comprehensive experiments on three SST datasets, our WMSR demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/oucailab/WMSR.

- **Summary**: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG), and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG -- to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models, achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54 and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge, this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter scales.

- **Summary**: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages. Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning, answer drafting, and iterative improvement.   A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias. The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized. Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

- **Summary**: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode. 2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights. In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between frames or videos.

- **Summary**: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information. To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets, demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves a balance between model performance and model complexity.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify \emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability. Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces \emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and (iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial defense.

- **Summary**: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks. Code and Model: https://github.com/neovateai/UI-UG

- **Summary**: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR) transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs, modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture. Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing, while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at https://github.com/CURRENTF/Uni-X

- **Summary**: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset, R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly, R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

- **Summary**: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations, thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details, including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as clouds.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7% increase in registration recall.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized - particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient, simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels, referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping.

- **Summary**: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences, but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT, our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric (EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains, while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step orderings and filter out noise.

- **Summary**: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However, extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy, realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

- **Summary**: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings, even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in: https://github.com/Claud1234/PCICF

- **Summary**: Generating synthetic multi-view images from a text prompt is an essential bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view synthetic images in just around 5 seconds. In essence, we propose a novel spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and multi-view consistency. We achieve effective training of RapidMV by strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant traction in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence for their potential in energy-efficient computing. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) excel at gradient-based optimization and high accuracy. This contrast has consequently led to a growing subfield of hybrid ANN-SNN research. However, existing hybrid approaches often rely on either a strict separation between ANN and SNN components or employ SNN-only encoders followed by ANN classifiers due to the constraints of non-differentiability of spike encoding functions, causing prior hybrid architectures to lack deep layer-wise cooperation during backpropagation. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN framework that integrates layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks within conventional ANN pipelines. Central to our method is the use of surrogate gradients for a bit-plane-based spike encoding function, enabling end-to-end differentiable training across ANN and SNN layers. This design achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models while retaining the potential efficiency and temporal representation benefits of spiking computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a surrogate gradient for bit plane coding specifically and spike encoder interface in general to be utilized in the context of hybrid ANN-SNN, successfully leading to a new class of hybrid models that pave new directions for future research.

- **Summary**: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application. Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search. We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our code is available at \hyperlink{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}.

- **Summary**: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development, with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.   This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset, we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training. Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.   Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in image-based machine learning.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering. To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles: first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training, avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset, Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

- **Summary**: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V) generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However, existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the field.

- **Summary**: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive 3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation, allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic, immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore benchmark.

- **Summary**: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR (+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over 2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate, efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot, inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion attributes according to target Laban tags.

- **Summary**: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills.

- **Summary**: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability. Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2. The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database. Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples before the selection.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general vision-language benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is crucial as it allows for timely intervention, preventing vision loss and enabling effective management of diabetic complications. This research performs detection of DR and DME at an early stage through the proposed framework which includes three stages: preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In the preprocessing stage, noise filtering is performed by fuzzy filtering, artefact removal is performed by non-linear diffusion filtering, and the contrast improvement is performed by a novel filter called Adaptive Variable Distance Speckle (AVDS) filter. The AVDS filter employs four distance calculation methods such as Euclidean, Bhattacharya, Manhattan, and Hamming. The filter adaptively chooses a distance method which produces the highest contrast value amongst all 3 methods. From the analysis, hamming distance method was found to achieve better results for contrast and Euclidean distance showing less error value with high PSNR. The segmentation stage is performed using Improved Mask-Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask RCNN). In the final stage, feature extraction and classification using novel Self-Spatial Attention infused VGG-16 (SSA-VGG-16), which effectively captures both global contextual relationships and critical spatial regions within retinal images, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of DR and DME detection and grading. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using two distinct datasets: IDRiD and MESSIDOR.

- **Summary**: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation. To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities. Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality imbalance in segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and significantly outperforms existing models.

- **Summary**: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the (diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training) for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning. Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10, 1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98% less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient, and general framework for training flow map models.

- **Summary**: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics, supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions. However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable, and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport, interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting, Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks, systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models.

- **Summary**: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in video large language models (VideoLLMs) call for new evaluation protocols and benchmarks for complex temporal reasoning in video-language understanding. Inspired by the needle in a haystack test widely used by LLMs, we introduce a novel task of Needle in a Montage (NeMo), designed to assess VideoLLMs' critical reasoning capabilities, including long-context recall and temporal grounding. To generate video question answering data for our task, we develop a scalable automated data generation pipeline that facilitates high-quality data synthesis. Built upon the proposed pipeline, we present NeMoBench, a video-language benchmark centered on our task. Specifically, our full set of NeMoBench features 31,378 automatically generated question-answer (QA) pairs from 13,486 videos with various durations ranging from seconds to hours. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline can reliably and automatically generate high-quality evaluation data, enabling NeMoBench to be continuously updated with the latest videos. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models on our benchmark, providing extensive results and key insights into their capabilities and limitations.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However, the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones, making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM architectures.

- **Summary**: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of 31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to 100\%.

- **Summary**: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education, and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200 samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull, reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is available at https://github.com/wang-zidu/BFSM

- **Summary**: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable, estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone. SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First, we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC) classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells. Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11, particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated, fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset (github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that identifies recurring patterns -- referred to as ``music-words'' -- from symbolic music data. These patterns are fundamental to musical structure and reflect the cognitive processes involved in composition. However, extracting these patterns remains challenging because of the inherent semantic ambiguity in musical interpretation. We formulate the task of music-word discovery as a statistical optimization problem and propose a two-stage Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based learning framework: 1. Developing a music-word dictionary; 2. Reconstructing the music data. When evaluated against human expert annotations, the algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61. Our findings indicate that minimizing code length effectively addresses semantic ambiguity, suggesting that human optimization of encoding systems shapes musical semantics. This approach enables computers to extract ``basic building blocks'' from music data, facilitating structural analysis and sparse encoding. The method has two primary applications. First, in AI music, it supports downstream tasks such as music generation, classification, style transfer, and improvisation. Second, in musicology, it provides a tool for analyzing compositional patterns and offers insights into the principle of minimal encoding across diverse musical styles and composers.

- **Summary**: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics, particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming, costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation. Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02% mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations, covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing. On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a critical gap in their role as generalists.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on specialized ones.

- **Summary**: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation. Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement, RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally, Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation. For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.   We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments diffusion models with a register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and controllable image generation.   We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.   Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative, scientific, and practical domains.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Volterra Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (VNODE), a piecewise continuous Volterra Neural Network that integrates nonlinear Volterra filtering with continuous time neural ordinary differential equations for image classification. Drawing inspiration from the visual cortex, where discrete event processing is interleaved with continuous integration, VNODE alternates between discrete Volterra feature extraction and ODE driven state evolution. This hybrid formulation captures complex patterns while requiring substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep architectures. VNODE consistently outperforms state of the art models with improved computational complexity as exemplified on benchmark datasets like CIFAR10 and Imagenet1K.

- **Summary**: Cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis refers to adaptively generating and optimizing grasps for various robotic hands with different morphologies. This capability is crucial for achieving versatile robotic manipulation in diverse environments and requires substantial amounts of reliable and diverse grasp data for effective model training and robust generalization. However, existing approaches either rely on physics-based optimization that lacks human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection processes that are limited to anthropomorphic structures. In this paper, we propose CEDex, a novel cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method at scale that bridges human grasping kinematics and robot kinematics by aligning robot kinematic models with generated human-like contact representations. Given an object's point cloud and an arbitrary robotic hand model, CEDex first generates human-like contact representations using a Conditional Variational Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data. It then performs kinematic human contact alignment through topological merging to consolidate multiple human hand parts into unified robot components, followed by a signed distance field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints. Using CEDex, we construct the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset to date, comprising 500K objects across four gripper types with 20M total grasps. Extensive experiments show that CEDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and our dataset benefits cross-embodiment grasp learning with high-quality diverse grasps.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of existing methods, it is observed that the classification component significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658, and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing camouflaged object segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size, number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python implementation of our pipeline is publicly available.

- **Summary**: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration. SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets, which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it. Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising. Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism, despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

- **Summary**: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113 meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles, and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets (e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models' ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic, establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their applications and to accelerate related research.

- **Summary**: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales. Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains, applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1) the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks; and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs' learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

- **Summary**: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR), aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model, effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

- **Summary**: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with \textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression. \textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas \textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and high-quality neural rendering.

- **Summary**: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound (V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition. Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified generative models.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception, especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning, and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual, textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1 significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks, offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal reasoning.

- **Summary**: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints. The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$ Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 in the UAVM2025 Challenge. Code will be released at https://github.com/HRT00/CVGL-3D.

- **Summary**: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism, which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate, inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning. As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

- **Summary**: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition, narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers (VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities. Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset. This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

- **Summary**: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation.

- **Summary**: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next, we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework, TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$ accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs, the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

- **Summary**: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5 minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task. Project Page: https://zcai0612.github.io/UP2You

- **Summary**: We propose a high-payload image watermarking method for textual embedding, where a semantic description of the image - which may also correspond to the input text prompt-, is embedded inside the image. In order to be able to robustly embed high payloads in large-scale images - such as those produced by modern AI generators - the proposed approach builds upon a traditional watermarking scheme that exploits orthogonal and turbo codes for improved robustness, and integrates frequency-domain embedding and perceptual masking techniques to enhance watermark imperceptibility. Experiments show that the proposed method is extremely robust against a wide variety of image processing, and the embedded text can be retrieved also after traditional and AI inpainting, permitting to unveil the semantic modification the image has undergone via image-text mismatch analysis.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations. Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end inference over the baseline.

- **Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components: (1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG solution.

- **Summary**: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital, yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35, confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines, enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream vision models in safety-critical environments.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024 tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness, efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video understanding.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals: a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge, the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different mediums.

- **Summary**: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study, we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day, Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

- **Summary**: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2 features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined) attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives (e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine interpretability with representational power.

- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI, and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality control in dynamic medical settings.

- **Summary**: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied, attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation pipelines.

- **Summary**: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU) show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

- **Summary**: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

- **Summary**: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and progression monitoring.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for \textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models, our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers. Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models, reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks, with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench) and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

- **Summary**: Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything communication has shown great promise in enhancing situational awareness for autonomous vehicles and other mobile robotic platforms. Despite recent advances in perception backbones and multi-agent fusion, real-world deployments remain challenged by hard detection cases, exemplified by partial detections and noise accumulation which limit downstream detection accuracy. This work presents Diffusion on Reinforced Cooperative Perception (DRCP), a real-time deployable framework designed to address aforementioned issues in dynamic driving environments. DRCP integrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent, a cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and adaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2) Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a novel lightweight diffusion-based refinement module that encourages robustness against feature perturbations and aligns bird's-eye-view features closer to the task-optimal manifold. The proposed system achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly improving robustness under challenging conditions. Code will be released in late 2025.

- **Summary**: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments, and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

- **Summary**: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code: https://github.com/biomedia-mira/seg-cft.

- **Summary**: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models: training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

- **Summary**: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding. Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME, NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

- **Summary**: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt & Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain settings.

- **Summary**: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships. Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs, an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

- **Summary**: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS 2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data, which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH), 0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This work ranked first in the BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1- Adult Glioma Segmentation.

- **Summary**: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting their practical usability. In this paper, we propose Wan-Alpha, a new framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as hair strands. The released model is available on our website: https://donghaotian123.github.io/Wan-Alpha/.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization, their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD. Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

- **Summary**: In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on image-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context, primitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios by compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations. Towards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be structure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware alignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel superquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes structure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to iteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap between primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by structure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to drive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on SDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In addition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement to preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce 3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both reconstruction quality and primitive-level editability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Light-SQ enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable shape abstraction with superquadrics for complex generated geometry, advancing the feasibility of 3D UGC creation.

- **Summary**: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field, they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents. To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories. Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward pass.

- **Summary**: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples, such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters ($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion process

- **Summary**: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content moderation

- **Summary**: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger; however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning, change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models. Code and models will be released publicly at https://mustansarfiaz.github.io/GeoVLM-R1/ .

- **Summary**: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work, we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues: contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting. Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

- **Summary**: As robots transition from controlled settings to unstructured human environments, building generalist agents that can reliably follow natural language instructions remains a central challenge. Progress in robust mobile manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich and long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states, six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469 episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of Vision-Language-Action models. The first version of our dataset is now available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/airoa-org/airoa-moma .

- **Summary**: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

The 1 x 1 normalization scheme and two feature representations (coordinate- and angle-based) are presented for the pipeline. In addition, an efficient method to improve robustness against camera angle variations is also introduced by using artificially rotated training data. Experiments on a custom traffic-control gesture dataset demonstrate high accuracy across varying viewing angles and speeds. Finally, an approach to calculate the speed of the arm signal (if necessary) is also presented.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding. We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250 micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

- **Summary**: Interactive editing of character images with diffusion models remains challenging due to the inherent trade-off between fine-grained control, generation speed, and visual fidelity. We introduce CharGen, a character-focused editor that combines attribute-specific Concept Sliders, trained to isolate and manipulate attributes such as facial feature size, expression, and decoration with the StreamDiffusion sampling pipeline for more interactive performance. To counteract the loss of detail that often accompanies accelerated sampling, we propose a lightweight Repair Step that reinstates fine textures without compromising structural consistency. Throughout extensive ablation studies and in comparison to open-source InstructPix2Pix and closed-source Google Gemini, and a comprehensive user study, CharGen achieves two-to-four-fold faster edit turnaround with precise editing control and identity-consistent results.

- **Summary**: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to 48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction, unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy.

To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image (D2I) generation framework that synthesizes over 20M realistic and geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth features.

- **Summary**: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost. In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation -- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation, we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets, UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image, achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality.

- **Summary**: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1 robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method.

- **Summary**: Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover, existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria: (1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic- and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i) segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion (AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians, enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines, which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training. Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one- or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations. Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly available.

- **Summary**: We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions. For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences, producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient, end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised long-horizon speech generation.

- **Summary**: Designers craft and edit graphic designs in a layer representation, but layer-based editing becomes impossible once composited into a raster image. In this work, we propose LayerD, a method to decompose raster graphic designs into layers for re-editable creative workflow. LayerD addresses the decomposition task by iteratively extracting unoccluded foreground layers. We propose a simple yet effective refinement approach taking advantage of the assumption that layers often exhibit uniform appearance in graphic designs. As decomposition is ill-posed and the ground-truth layer structure may not be reliable, we develop a quality metric that addresses the difficulty. In experiments, we show that LayerD successfully achieves high-quality decomposition and outperforms baselines. We also demonstrate the use of LayerD with state-of-the-art image generators and layer-based editing.

- **Summary**: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.

- **Summary**: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit. However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice, where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images. TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain. We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of 2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address this challenge.

- **Summary**: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and 440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation, semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform), across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments (indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors (resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at 25-75 Hz at HD resolution.
