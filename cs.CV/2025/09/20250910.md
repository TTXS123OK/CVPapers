- **Summary**: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability, existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet. Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore, a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

- **Summary**: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps. Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention, global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset and the data generation framework are publicly available at https://github.com/ta-ho/GTA-Crime.

- **Summary**: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy, 99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0% accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%, outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment in real-world clinical screening systems.

- **Summary**: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%) compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer. The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the method.

- **Summary**: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images, which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules (SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI) module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs. Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

- **Summary**: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g., with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size, number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and, subsequently, its overall performance.



### Generalized Zero-Shot Learning for Point Cloud Segmentation with Evidence-Based Dynamic Calibration

- **Summary**: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object, or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and 55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD methods.

- **Summary**: Foundation models are revolutionizing autonomous driving perception, transitioning the field from narrow, task-specific deep learning models to versatile, general-purpose architectures trained on vast, diverse datasets. This survey examines how these models address critical challenges in autonomous perception, including limitations in generalization, scalability, and robustness to distributional shifts. The survey introduces a novel taxonomy structured around four essential capabilities for robust performance in dynamic driving environments: generalized knowledge, spatial understanding, multi-sensor robustness, and temporal reasoning. For each capability, the survey elucidates its significance and comprehensively reviews cutting-edge approaches. Diverging from traditional method-centric surveys, our unique framework prioritizes conceptual design principles, providing a capability-driven guide for model development and clearer insights into foundational aspects. We conclude by discussing key challenges, particularly those associated with the integration of these capabilities into real-time, scalable systems, and broader deployment challenges related to computational demands and ensuring model reliability against issues like hallucinations and out-of-distribution failures. The survey also outlines crucial future research directions to enable the safe and effective deployment of foundation models in autonomous driving systems.

- **Summary**: Oil palm cultivation remains one of the leading causes of deforestation in Indonesia. To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert labeling of high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 to 2024. The dataset provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY license, it fills a key gap in training data for remote sensing and aims to improve the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent monitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global deforestation reduction goals and follows FAIR data principles.

- **Summary**: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However, in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then, similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports. The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods.

- **Summary**: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets. Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy" samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples. This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions. Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment, we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10 dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45 percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation. These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

- **Summary**: Enhancing RAW images captured under low light conditions is a challenging task. Recent deep learning based RAW enhancement methods have shifted from using real paired data to relying on synthetic datasets. These synthetic datasets are typically generated by physically modeling sensor noise, but existing approaches often consider only additive noise, ignore multiplicative components, and rely on global calibration that overlooks pixel level manufacturing variations. As a result, such methods struggle to accurately reproduce real sensor noise. To address these limitations, this paper derives a noise model from the physical noise generation mechanisms that occur under low illumination and proposes a novel composite model that integrates both additive and multiplicative noise. To solve the model, we introduce a physics based per pixel noise simulation and calibration scheme that estimates and synthesizes noise for each individual pixel, thereby overcoming the restrictions of traditional global calibration and capturing spatial noise variations induced by microscopic CMOS manufacturing differences. Motivated by the strong performance of rectified flow methods in image generation and processing, we further combine the physics-based noise synthesis with a rectified flow generative framework and present PGRF a physics-guided rectified flow framework for low light image enhancement. PGRF leverages the ability of rectified flows to model complex data distributions and uses physical guidance to steer the generation toward the desired clean image. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we established the LLID dataset, an indoor low light benchmark captured with the Sony A7S II camera. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in low light RAW image enhancement.

- **Summary**: Visual-based localization has made significant progress, yet its performance often drops in large-scale, outdoor, and long-term settings due to factors like lighting changes, dynamic scenes, and low-texture areas. These challenges degrade feature extraction and tracking, which are critical for accurate motion estimation. While learning-based methods such as SuperPoint and SuperGlue show improved feature coverage and robustness, they still face generalization issues with out-of-distribution data. We address this by enhancing deep feature extraction and tracking through self-supervised learning with task specific feedback. Our method promotes stable and informative features, improving generalization and reliability in challenging environments.

- **Summary**: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a crucial component for autonomous driving and smart transportation. However, in the process of basic feature extraction, perspective transformation, and feature fusion, noise and error will gradually accumulate. To address this issue, we propose InsFusion, which can extract proposals from both raw and fused features and utilizes these proposals to query the raw features, thereby mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader field of video analysis and generation.

- **Summary**: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding. Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular 2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

- **Summary**: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance. The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the representation learning process, enabling better general information preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders. Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%, and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly 1\% in parameters.

- **Summary**: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion. However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9% on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

- **Summary**: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise, blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme. Code will be made available publicly.

- **Summary**: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness (CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes, providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet), which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

- **Summary**: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa 3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events. Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance, interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

- **Summary**: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view} assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive) also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\% improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

- **Summary**: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging (such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small, single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning. The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness, and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

- **Summary**: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications, including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation. However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges, computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD, but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further research on optimization techniques.

- **Summary**: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door", "approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper", etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

- **Summary**: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text, reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control, we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative multimodal-conditioned HCVG.

- **Summary**: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions. Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects in longer videos.

- **Summary**: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction. To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia 2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks: Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24 views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as selection matrices.

- **Summary**: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain. Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence. The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization. Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation, convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable knowledge at continental scale.

- **Summary**: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation. Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia, which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

- **Summary**: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its suitability for real-time forensic applications.

- **Summary**: This research explored the hybridization of CNN and ViT within a training dataset of limited size, and introduced a distinct class imbalance. The training was made from scratch with a mere focus on theoretically and experimentally exploring the architectural strengths of the proposed hybrid model. Experiments were conducted across varied data fractions with balanced and imbalanced training datasets. Comparatively, the hybrid model, complementing the strengths of CNN and ViT, achieved the highest recall of 0.9443 (50% data fraction in balanced) and consistency in F1 score around 0.85, suggesting reliability in diagnosis. Additionally, the model was successful in outperforming CNN and ViT in imbalanced datasets. Despite its complex architecture, it required comparable training time to the transformers in all data fractions.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging. Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large, multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance. We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile, an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing 5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization. (3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

- **Summary**: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective, the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space. During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9 diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data. By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods, which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task, showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases. Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly or incomplete.

- **Summary**: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are among the most common tests in medicine. Automated image interpretation may reduce radiologists\' workload and expand access to diagnostic expertise. Deep learning multi-task and foundation models have shown strong performance for CXR interpretation but are vulnerable to shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious and off-target correlations rather than clinically relevant features to make decisions. We introduce RoentMod, a counterfactual image editing framework that generates anatomically realistic CXRs with user-specified, synthetic pathology while preserving unrelated anatomical features of the original scan. RoentMod combines an open-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image modification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with board-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images appeared realistic in 93\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified finding in 89-99\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real follow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task and foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts, limiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual images during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model discrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\% AUC in internal validation and by 1-11\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing. These findings establish RoentMod as a broadly applicable tool for probing and correcting shortcut learning in medical AI. By enabling controlled counterfactual interventions, RoentMod enhances the robustness and interpretability of CXR interpretation models and provides a generalizable strategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Generating 3D shapes at part level is pivotal for downstream applications such as mesh retopology, UV mapping, and 3D printing. However, existing part-based generation methods often lack sufficient controllability and suffer from poor semantically meaningful decomposition. To this end, we introduce X-Part, a controllable generative model designed to decompose a holistic 3D object into semantically meaningful and structurally coherent parts with high geometric fidelity. X-Part exploits the bounding box as prompts for the part generation and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful decomposition. Furthermore, we design an editable pipeline for interactive part generation. Extensive experimental results show that X-Part achieves state-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation. This work establishes a new paradigm for creating production-ready, editable, and structurally sound 3D assets. Codes will be released for public research.

- **Summary**: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods, often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

- **Summary**: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and scenarios with limited annotations.

- **Summary**: Coastal water segmentation from satellite imagery presents unique challenges due to complex spectral characteristics and irregular boundary patterns. Traditional RGB-based approaches often suffer from training instability and poor generalization in diverse maritime environments. This paper introduces a systematic robust enhancement framework, referred to as Robust U-Net, that leverages HSV color space supervision and multi-modal constraints for improved coastal water segmentation. Our approach integrates five synergistic components: HSV-guided color supervision, gradient-based coastline optimization, morphological post-processing, sea area cleanup, and connectivity control. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that HSV supervision provides the highest impact (0.85 influence score), while the complete framework achieves superior training stability (84\% variance reduction) and enhanced segmentation quality. Our method shows consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective solution for visual navigation in open-set environments.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI) techniques and their transformative impact on computer vision (CV) applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity visual data in challenging conditions, such as low light, motion blur, or high dynamic range scenes, thereby limiting the performance of state-of-the-art CV systems. Computational imaging techniques, including light field imaging, high dynamic range (HDR) imaging, deblurring, high-speed imaging, and glare mitigation, address these limitations by enhancing image acquisition and reconstruc- tion processes. This survey systematically explores the synergies between CI techniques and core CV tasks, including object detection, depth estimation, optical flow, face recognition, and keypoint detection. By analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities, challenges, and future research directions. We emphasize the potential for task-specific, adaptive imaging pipelines that improve robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in real-world scenarios, such as autonomous navigation, surveillance, augmented reality, and robotics.

In the age of large models, where energy efficiency, computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall, our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM (BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source code is available at https://github.com/thico0224/BcQLM.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder. Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general 2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected. Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman dataset, demonstrating its generalizability.

- **Summary**: Robot navigation in dynamic, human-centered environments requires socially-compliant decisions grounded in robust scene understanding. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However, it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot navigation needs.

- **Summary**: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core, ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are available at https://kth-rpl.github.io/ArgoTweak/.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

- **Summary**: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can support early detection and timely interventions.   Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20 classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a web-based diagnostic tool.   Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions, increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.   Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities, where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection and timely intervention.

- **Summary**: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds. Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all code and data used to generate our results: https://gitlab.kitware.com/nest-public/telescope_accuracy_quantification.

- **Summary**: The multimodal nature of music performance has driven increasing interest in data beyond the audio domain within the music information retrieval (MIR) community. This paper introduces PianoVAM, a comprehensive piano performance dataset that includes videos, audio, MIDI, hand landmarks, fingering labels, and rich metadata. The dataset was recorded using a Disklavier piano, capturing audio and MIDI from amateur pianists during their daily practice sessions, alongside synchronized top-view videos in realistic and varied performance conditions. Hand landmarks and fingering labels were extracted using a pretrained hand pose estimation model and a semi-automated fingering annotation algorithm. We discuss the challenges encountered during data collection and the alignment process across different modalities. Additionally, we describe our fingering annotation method based on hand landmarks extracted from videos. Finally, we present benchmarking results for both audio-only and audio-visual piano transcription using the PianoVAM dataset and discuss additional potential applications.

- **Summary**: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases -- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance and improving generative video quality.

- **Summary**: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

- **Summary**: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene. Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from this single monocular RGB video.
