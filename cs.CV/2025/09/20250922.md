- **Summary**: Coral aquaculture for reef restoration requires accurate and continuous spawn counting for resource distribution and larval health monitoring, but current methods are labor-intensive and represent a critical bottleneck in the coral production pipeline. We propose the Coral Spawn and Larvae Imaging Camera System (CSLICS), which uses low cost modular cameras and object detectors trained using human-in-the-loop labeling approaches for automated spawn counting in larval rearing tanks. This paper details the system engineering, dataset collection, and computer vision techniques to detect, classify and count coral spawn. Experimental results from mass spawning events demonstrate an F1 score of 82.4\% for surface spawn detection at different embryogenesis stages, 65.3\% F1 score for sub-surface spawn detection, and a saving of 5,720 hours of labor per spawning event compared to manual sampling methods at the same frequency. Comparison of manual counts with CSLICS monitoring during a mass coral spawning event on the Great Barrier Reef demonstrates CSLICS' accurate measurement of fertilization success and sub-surface spawn counts. These findings enhance the coral aquaculture process and enable upscaling of coral reef restoration efforts to address climate change threats facing ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef.

- **Summary**: Visual Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a crucial component of robotic perception, yet existing Tracking-By-Detection (TBD) methods often rely on 2D cues, such as bounding boxes and motion modeling, which struggle under occlusions and close-proximity interactions. Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking.

- **Summary**: Building autonomous agents that perceive and operate graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like humans has long been a vision in the field of artificial intelligence. Central to these agents is the capability for GUI interaction, which involves GUI understanding and planning capabilities. Existing methods have tried developing GUI agents based on the multi-modal comprehension ability of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the limited scenario, insufficient size, and heterogeneous action spaces hinder the progress of building generalist GUI agents. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes \textbf{UIPro}, a novel generalist GUI agent trained with extensive multi-platform and multi-task GUI interaction data, coupled with a unified action space. We first curate a comprehensive dataset encompassing 20.6 million GUI understanding tasks to pre-train UIPro, granting it a strong GUI grounding capability, which is key to downstream GUI agent tasks. Subsequently, we establish a unified action space to harmonize heterogeneous GUI agent task datasets and produce a merged dataset to foster the action prediction ability of UIPro via continued fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate UIPro's superior performance across multiple GUI task benchmarks on various platforms, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Smoke in real-world scenes can severely degrade the quality of images and hamper visibility. Recent methods for image restoration either rely on data-driven priors that are susceptible to hallucinations, or are limited to static low-density smoke. We introduce SmokeSeer, a method for simultaneous 3D scene reconstruction and smoke removal from a video capturing multiple views of a scene. Our method uses thermal and RGB images, leveraging the fact that the reduced scattering in thermal images enables us to see through the smoke. We build upon 3D Gaussian splatting to fuse information from the two image modalities, and decompose the scene explicitly into smoke and non-smoke components. Unlike prior approaches, SmokeSeer handles a broad range of smoke densities and can adapt to temporally varying smoke. We validate our approach on synthetic data and introduce a real-world multi-view smoke dataset with RGB and thermal images. We provide open-source code and data at the project website.

- **Summary**: Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are the primary medium for human-computer interaction, yet automating GUI interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of visual elements, dynamic environments, and the need for multi-step reasoning. Existing methods based on vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from limited resolution, domain mismatch, and insufficient sequential decisionmaking capability. To address these issues, we propose Mano, a robust GUI agent built upon a multi-modal foundation model pre-trained on extensive web and computer system data. Our approach integrates a novel simulated environment for high-fidelity data generation, a three-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning, offline reinforcement learning, and online reinforcement learning), and a verification module for error recovery. Mano demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI benchmarks, including Mind2Web and OSWorld, achieving significant improvements in success rate and operational accuracy. Our work provides new insights into the effective integration of reinforcement learning with VLMs for practical GUI agent deployment, highlighting the importance of domain-specific data, iterative training, and holistic reward design.

- **Summary**: Automatic image captioning, a multifaceted task bridging computer vision and natural lan- guage processing, aims to generate descriptive textual content from visual input. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have achieved significant advancements, they present limitations. The inherent sequential nature of RNNs leads to sluggish training and inference times. LSTMs further struggle with retaining information from earlier sequence elements when dealing with very long se- quences. This project presents a comprehensive guide to constructing and comprehending transformer models for image captioning. Transformers employ self-attention mechanisms, capturing both short- and long-range dependencies within the data. This facilitates efficient parallelization during both training and inference phases. We leverage the well-established Transformer architecture, recognized for its effectiveness in managing sequential data, and present a meticulous methodology. Utilizing the Flickr30k dataset, we conduct data pre- processing, construct a model architecture that integrates an EfficientNetB0 CNN for fea- ture extraction, and train the model with attention mechanisms incorporated. Our approach exemplifies the utilization of parallelization for efficient training and inference. You can find the project on GitHub.



### Revisiting Vision Language Foundations for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment

- **Summary**: Large-scale vision language pre-training has recently shown promise for no-reference image-quality assessment (NR-IQA), yet the relative merits of modern Vision Transformer foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of six prominent pretrained backbones, CLIP, SigLIP2, DINOv2, DINOv3, Perception, and ResNet, for the task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA), each finetuned using an identical lightweight MLP head. Our study uncovers two previously overlooked factors: (1) SigLIP2 consistently achieves strong performance; and (2) the choice of activation function plays a surprisingly crucial role, particularly for enhancing the generalization ability of image quality assessment models. Notably, we find that simple sigmoid activations outperform commonly used ReLU and GELU on several benchmarks. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a learnable activation selection mechanism that adaptively determines the nonlinearity for each channel, eliminating the need for manual activation design, and achieving new state-of-the-art SRCC on CLIVE, KADID10K, and AGIQA3K. Extensive ablations confirm the benefits across architectures and regimes, establishing strong, resource-efficient NR-IQA baselines.

- **Summary**: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are vital for reliable urban positioning. However, multipath and non-line-of-sight reception often introduce large measurement errors that degrade accuracy. Learning-based methods for predicting and compensating pseudorange errors have gained traction, but their performance is limited by complex error distributions. To address this challenge, we propose Diff-GNSS, a coarse-to-fine GNSS measurement (pseudorange) error estimation framework that leverages a conditional diffusion model to capture such complex distributions. Firstly, a Mamba-based module performs coarse estimation to provide an initial prediction with appropriate scale and trend. Then, a conditional denoising diffusion layer refines the estimate, enabling fine-grained modeling of pseudorange errors. To suppress uncontrolled generative diversity and achieve controllable synthesis, three key features related to GNSS measurement quality are used as conditions to precisely guide the reverse denoising process. We further incorporate per-satellite uncertainty modeling within the diffusion stage to assess the reliability of the predicted errors. We have collected and publicly released a real-world dataset covering various scenes. Experiments on public and self-collected datasets show that DiffGNSS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models to pseudorange error estimation. The proposed diffusion-based refinement module is plug-and-play and can be readily integrated into existing networks to markedly improve estimation accuracy.

- **Summary**: How do vision transformers (ViTs) represent and process the world? This paper addresses this long-standing question through the first systematic analysis of 6.6K features across all layers, extracted via sparse autoencoders, and by introducing the residual replacement model, which replaces ViT computations with interpretable features in the residual stream. Our analysis reveals not only a feature evolution from low-level patterns to high-level semantics, but also how ViTs encode curves and spatial positions through specialized feature types. The residual replacement model scalably produces a faithful yet parsimonious circuit for human-scale interpretability by significantly simplifying the original computations. As a result, this framework enables intuitive understanding of ViT mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in debiasing spurious correlations.

- **Summary**: Indonesia's marine ecosystems, part of the globally recognized Coral Triangle, are among the richest in biodiversity, requiring efficient monitoring tools to support conservation. Traditional fish detection methods are time-consuming and demand expert knowledge, prompting the need for automated solutions. This study explores the implementation of YOLOv10-nano, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, for real-time marine fish detection in Indonesian waters, using test data from Bunaken National Marine Park. YOLOv10's architecture, featuring improvements like the CSPNet backbone, PAN for feature fusion, and Pyramid Spatial Attention Block, enables efficient and accurate object detection even in complex environments. The model was evaluated on the DeepFish and OpenImages V7-Fish datasets. Results show that YOLOv10-nano achieves a high detection accuracy with mAP50 of 0.966 and mAP50:95 of 0.606 while maintaining low computational demand (2.7M parameters, 8.4 GFLOPs). It also delivered an average inference speed of 29.29 FPS on the CPU, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Although OpenImages V7-Fish alone provided lower accuracy, it complemented DeepFish in enhancing model robustness. Overall, this study demonstrates YOLOv10-nano's potential for efficient, scalable marine fish monitoring and conservation applications in data-limited environments.

- **Summary**: Spelling correction from visual input poses unique challenges for vision language models (VLMs), as it requires not only detecting but also correcting textual errors directly within images. We present ReViCo (Real Visual Correction), the first benchmark that systematically evaluates VLMs on real-world visual spelling correction across Chinese and English. ReViCo contains naturally occurring errors collected from real-world image data and supports fine-grained evaluation at both image and token levels. Through comprehensive experiments on representative cascaded (Qwen) and native (InternVL) open-source models, as well as closed-source systems (GPT-4o, Claude), we show that current VLMs fall significantly short of human performance, particularly in correction. To address these limitations, we explore two solution paradigms: a Joint OCR-Correction pipeline and a Background Information enhanced approach, both of which yield consistent performance gains. Our analysis highlights fundamental limitations of existing architectures and provides actionable insights for advancing multimodal spelling correction.

- **Summary**: We propose a single-snapshot depth-from-defocus (DFD) reconstruction method for coded-aperture imaging that replaces hand-crafted priors with a learned diffusion prior used purely as regularization. Our optimization framework enforces measurement consistency via a differentiable forward model while guiding solutions with the diffusion prior in the denoised image domain, yielding higher accuracy and stability than clas- sical optimization. Unlike U-Net-style regressors, our approach requires no paired defocus-RGBD training data and does not tie training to a specific camera configuration. Experiments on comprehensive simulations and a prototype camera demonstrate consistently strong RGBD reconstructions across noise levels, outperforming both U-Net baselines and a classical coded- aperture DFD method.

- **Summary**: Accurate temporal prediction is the bridge between comprehensive scene understanding and embodied artificial intelligence. However, predicting multiple fine-grained states of a scene at multiple temporal scales is difficult for vision-language models. We formalize the Multi-Scale Temporal Prediction (MSTP) task in general and surgical scenes by decomposing multi-scale into two orthogonal dimensions: the temporal scale, forecasting states of humans and surgery at varying look-ahead intervals, and the state scale, modeling a hierarchy of states in general and surgical scenes. For example, in general scenes, states of contact relationships are finer-grained than states of spatial relationships. In surgical scenes, medium-level steps are finer-grained than high-level phases yet remain constrained by their encompassing phase. To support this unified task, we introduce the first MSTP Benchmark, featuring synchronized annotations across multiple state scales and temporal scales. We further propose a method, Incremental Generation and Multi-agent Collaboration (IG-MC), which integrates two key innovations. First, we present a plug-and-play incremental generation module that continuously synthesizes up-to-date visual previews at expanding temporal scales to inform multiple decision-making agents, keeping decisions and generated visuals synchronized and preventing performance degradation as look-ahead intervals lengthen. Second, we present a decision-driven multi-agent collaboration framework for multi-state prediction, comprising generation, initiation, and multi-state assessment agents that dynamically trigger and evaluate prediction cycles to balance global coherence and local fidelity.

- **Summary**: The field of Embodied AI predominantly relies on simulation for training and evaluation, often using either fully synthetic environments that lack photorealism or high-fidelity real-world reconstructions captured with expensive hardware. As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20% and 40% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87-0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new approach to estimate accurate and robust 3D semantic correspondence with the hierarchical neural semantic representation. Our work has three key contributions. First, we design the hierarchical neural semantic representation (HNSR), which consists of a global semantic feature to capture high-level structure and multi-resolution local geometric features to preserve fine details, by carefully harnessing 3D priors from pre-trained 3D generative models. Second, we design a progressive global-to-local matching strategy, which establishes coarse semantic correspondence using the global semantic feature, then iteratively refines it with local geometric features, yielding accurate and semantically-consistent mappings. Third, our framework is training-free and broadly compatible with various pre-trained 3D generative backbones, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse shape categories. Our method also supports various applications, such as shape co-segmentation, keypoint matching, and texture transfer, and generalizes well to structurally diverse shapes, with promising results even in cross-category scenarios. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques.



### Training-Free Label Space Alignment for Universal Domain Adaptation

- **Summary**: Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where label spaces may differ and the target domain may contain private classes. Previous UniDA methods primarily focused on visual space alignment but often struggled with visual ambiguities due to content differences, which limited their robustness and generalizability. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the strong \textit{zero-shot capabilities} of recent vision-language foundation models (VLMs) like CLIP, concentrating solely on label space alignment to enhance adaptation stability. CLIP can generate task-specific classifiers based only on label names. However, adapting CLIP to UniDA is challenging because the label space is not fully known in advance. In this study, we first utilize generative vision-language models to identify unknown categories in the target domain. Noise and semantic ambiguities in the discovered labels -- such as those similar to source labels (e.g., synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms) -- complicate label alignment. To address this, we propose a training-free label-space alignment method for UniDA (\ours). Our method aligns label spaces instead of visual spaces by filtering and refining noisy labels between the domains. We then construct a \textit{universal classifier} that integrates both shared knowledge and target-private class information, thereby improving generalizability under domain shifts. The results reveal that the proposed method considerably outperforms existing UniDA techniques across key DomainBed benchmarks, delivering an average improvement of \textcolor{blue}{+7.9\%}in H-score and \textcolor{blue}{+6.1\%} in H$^3$-score. Furthermore, incorporating self-training further enhances performance and achieves an additional (\textcolor{blue}{+1.6\%}) increment in both H- and H$^3$-scores.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of facial recognition systems presents major privacy risks, driving the need for effective countermeasures. Current adversarial techniques apply generalized methods rather than adapting to individual facial characteristics, limiting their effectiveness and inconspicuousness. In this work, we introduce Layer Embedding Activation Mapping (LEAM), a novel technique that identifies which facial areas contribute most to recognition at an individual level. Unlike adversarial attack methods that aim to fool recognition systems, LEAM is an explainability technique designed to understand how these systems work, providing insights that could inform future privacy protection research. We integrate LEAM with a face parser to analyze data from 1000 individuals across 9 pre-trained facial recognition models.   Our analysis reveals that while different layers within facial recognition models vary significantly in their focus areas, these models generally prioritize similar facial regions across architectures when considering their overall activation patterns, which show significantly higher similarity between images of the same individual (Bhattacharyya Coefficient: 0.32-0.57) vs. different individuals (0.04-0.13), validating the existence of person-specific recognition patterns. Our results show that facial recognition models prioritize the central region of face images (with nose areas accounting for 18.9-29.7% of critical recognition regions), while still distributing attention across multiple facial fragments. Proper selection of relevant facial areas was confirmed using validation occlusions, based on just 1% of the most relevant, LEAM-identified, image pixels, which proved to be transferable across different models. Our findings establish the foundation for future individually tailored privacy protection systems centered around LEAM's choice of areas to be perturbed.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships, attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning. While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone: optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image quality and diversity.

- **Summary**: Spike-based transformer is a novel architecture aiming to enhance the performance of spiking neural networks while mitigating the energy overhead inherent to transformers. However, methods for generating these models suffer from critical limitations: excessive training costs introduced by direct training methods, or unavoidably hardware-unfriendly operations in existing conversion methods. In this paper, we propose CSDformer, a novel conversion method for fully spike-driven transformers. We tailor a conversion-oriented transformer-based architecture and propose a new function NReLU to replace softmax in self-attention. Subsequently, this model is quantized and trained, and converted into a fully spike-driven model with temporal decomposition technique. Also, we propose delayed Integrate-andFire neurons to reduce conversion errors and improve the performance of spiking models. We evaluate CSDformer on ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and achieve 76.36% top-1 accuracy under 7 time-steps on ImageNet, demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, CSDformer eliminates the need for training SNNs, thereby reducing training costs (reducing computational resource by 75% and accelerating training speed by 2-3$\times$). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully spike-driven transformer-based model developed via conversion method, achieving high performance under ultra-low latency, while dramatically reducing both computational complexity and training overhead.

- **Summary**: The goal of multi-task learning is to learn to conduct multiple tasks simultaneously based on a shared data representation. While this approach can improve learning efficiency, it may also cause performance degradation due to task conflicts that arise when optimizing the model for different objectives. To address this challenge, we introduce MAESTRO, a structured framework designed to generate task-specific features and mitigate feature interference in multi-task 3D perception, including 3D object detection, bird's-eye view (BEV) map segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction. MAESTRO comprises three components: the Class-wise Prototype Generator (CPG), the Task-Specific Feature Generator (TSFG), and the Scene Prototype Aggregator (SPA). CPG groups class categories into foreground and background groups and generates group-wise prototypes. The foreground and background prototypes are assigned to the 3D object detection task and the map segmentation task, respectively, while both are assigned to the 3D occupancy prediction task. TSFG leverages these prototype groups to retain task-relevant features while suppressing irrelevant features, thereby enhancing the performance for each task. SPA enhances the prototype groups assigned for 3D occupancy prediction by utilizing the information produced by the 3D object detection head and the map segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that MAESTRO consistently outperforms existing methods across 3D object detection, BEV map segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction tasks.

- **Summary**: Portrait animation aims to generate photo-realistic videos from a single source image by reenacting the expression and pose from a driving video. While early methods relied on 3D morphable models or feature warping techniques, they often suffered from limited expressivity, temporal inconsistency, and poor generalization to unseen identities or large pose variations. Recent advances using diffusion models have demonstrated improved quality but remain constrained by weak control signals and architectural limitations. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion based framework that leverages masked facial regions specifically the eyes, nose, and mouth from the driving video as strong motion control cues. To enable robust training without appearance leakage, we adopt cross identity supervision. To leverage the strong prior from the pretrained diffusion model, our novel architecture introduces minimal new parameters that converge faster and help in better generalization. We introduce spatial temporal attention mechanisms that allow inter frame and intra frame interactions, effectively capturing subtle motions and reducing temporal artifacts. Our model uses history frames to ensure continuity across segments. At inference, we propose a novel signal fusion strategy that balances motion fidelity with identity preservation. Our approach achieves superior temporal consistency and accurate expression control, enabling high-quality, controllable portrait animation suitable for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress, yet hallucination remains a critical barrier, particularly in chart understanding, which requires sophisticated perceptual and cognitive abilities as well as rigorous factual accuracy. While prior work has investigated hallucinations and chart comprehension independently, their intersection remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present ChartHal, a benchmark that features a fine-grained taxonomy of hallucination scenarios in chart understanding, along with a human-validated dataset of 1,062 samples. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LVLMs suffer from severe hallucinations on ChartHal, including proprietary models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini, which achieve only 34.46% and 22.79% accuracy, respectively. Further analysis reveals that questions involving information absent from or contradictory to charts are especially likely to trigger hallucinations, underscoring the urgent need for more robust mitigation strategies.

- **Summary**: Multimodal pathological images are usually in clinical diagnosis, but computer vision-based multimodal image-assisted diagnosis faces challenges with modality fusion, especially in the absence of expert-annotated data. To achieve the modality fusion in multimodal images with label scarcity, we propose a novel ``pretraining + fine-tuning" framework for multimodal semi-supervised medical image classification. Specifically, we propose a synergistic learning pretraining framework of consistency, reconstructive, and aligned learning. By treating one modality as an augmented sample of another modality, we implement a self-supervised learning pre-train, enhancing the baseline model's feature representation capability. Then, we design a fine-tuning method for multimodal fusion. During the fine-tuning stage, we set different encoders to extract features from the original modalities and provide a multimodal fusion encoder for fusion modality. In addition, we propose a distribution shift method for multimodal fusion features, which alleviates the prediction uncertainty and overfitting risks caused by the lack of labeled samples. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available gastroscopy image datasets Kvasir and Kvasirv2. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art classification methods.

- **Summary**: Driver drowsiness remains a critical factor in road accidents, accounting for thousands of fatalities and injuries each year. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of real-time, non-intrusive drowsiness detection methods, focusing on computer vision based YOLO (You Look Only Once) algorithms. A publicly available dataset namely, UTA-RLDD was used, containing both awake and drowsy conditions, ensuring variability in gender, eyewear, illumination, and skin tone. Seven YOLO variants (v5s, v9c, v9t, v10n, v10l, v11n, v11l) are fine-tuned, with performance measured in terms of Precision, Recall, mAP0.5, and mAP 0.5-0.95. Among these, YOLOv9c achieved the highest accuracy (0.986 mAP 0.5, 0.978 Recall) while YOLOv11n strikes the optimal balance between precision (0.954) and inference efficiency, making it highly suitable for embedded deployment. Additionally, we implement an Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) approach using Dlib's facial landmarks, which despite its low computational footprint exhibits reduced robustness under pose variation and occlusions. Our findings illustrate clear trade offs between accuracy, latency, and resource requirements, and offer practical guidelines for selecting or combining detection methods in autonomous driving and industrial safety applications.

- **Summary**: Large-scale Video Object Segmentation (LSVOS) addresses the challenge of accurately tracking and segmenting objects in long video sequences, where difficulties stem from object reappearance, small-scale targets, heavy occlusions, and crowded scenes. Existing approaches predominantly adopt SAM2-based frameworks with various memory mechanisms for complex video mask generation. In this report, we proposed Segment Anything with Memory Strengthened Object Navigation (SAMSON), the 3rd place solution in the MOSE track of ICCV 2025, which integrates the strengths of stateof-the-art VOS models into an effective paradigm. To handle visually similar instances and long-term object disappearance in MOSE, we incorporate a long-term memorymodule for reliable object re-identification. Additionly, we adopt SAM2Long as a post-processing strategy to reduce error accumulation and enhance segmentation stability in long video sequences. Our method achieved a final performance of 0.8427 in terms of J &F in the test-set leaderboard.

- **Summary**: Volumetric video has emerged as a key medium for immersive telepresence and augmented/virtual reality, enabling six-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) navigation and realistic spatial interactions. However, delivering high-quality dynamic volumetric content at scale remains challenging due to massive data volume, complex motion, and limited editability of existing representations. In this paper, we present 4D-MoDe, a motion-decoupled 4D Gaussian compression framework designed for scalable and editable volumetric video streaming. Our method introduces a layered representation that explicitly separates static backgrounds from dynamic foregrounds using a lookahead-based motion decomposition strategy, significantly reducing temporal redundancy and enabling selective background/foreground streaming. To capture continuous motion trajectories, we employ a multi-resolution motion estimation grid and a lightweight shared MLP, complemented by a dynamic Gaussian compensation mechanism to model emergent content. An adaptive grouping scheme dynamically inserts background keyframes to balance temporal consistency and compression efficiency. Furthermore, an entropy-aware training pipeline jointly optimizes the motion fields and Gaussian parameters under a rate-distortion (RD) objective, while employing range-based and KD-tree compression to minimize storage overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that 4D-MoDe consistently achieves competitive reconstruction quality with an order of magnitude lower storage cost (e.g., as low as \textbf{11.4} KB/frame) compared to state-of-the-art methods, while supporting practical applications such as background replacement and foreground-only streaming.

- **Summary**: Achieving seamless viewing of high-fidelity volumetric video, comparable to 2D video experiences, remains an open challenge. Existing volumetric video compression methods either lack the flexibility to adjust quality and bitrate within a single model for efficient streaming across diverse networks and devices, or struggle with real-time decoding and rendering on lightweight mobile platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce 4DGCPro, a novel hierarchical 4D Gaussian compression framework that facilitates real-time mobile decoding and high-quality rendering via progressive volumetric video streaming in a single bitstream. Specifically, we propose a perceptually-weighted and compression-friendly hierarchical 4D Gaussian representation with motion-aware adaptive grouping to reduce temporal redundancy, preserve coherence, and enable scalable multi-level detail streaming. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end entropy-optimized training scheme, which incorporates layer-wise rate-distortion (RD) supervision and attribute-specific entropy modeling for efficient bitstream generation. Extensive experiments show that 4DGCPro enables flexible quality and multiple bitrate within a single model, achieving real-time decoding and rendering on mobile devices while outperforming existing methods in RD performance across multiple datasets.

- **Summary**: Brain tumor segmentation requires accurate identification of hierarchical regions including whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhancing tumor (ET) from multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Due to tumor tissue heterogeneity, ambiguous boundaries, and contrast variations across MRI sequences, methods relying solely on visual information or post-hoc loss constraints show unstable performance in boundary delineation and hierarchy preservation. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Multimodal Coherent Field (UMCF) method. This method achieves synchronous interactive fusion of visual, semantic, and spatial information within a unified 3D latent space, adaptively adjusting modal contributions through parameter-free uncertainty gating, with medical prior knowledge directly participating in attention computation, avoiding the traditional "process-then-concatenate" separated architecture. On Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020 and 2021 datasets, UMCF+nnU-Net achieves average Dice coefficients of 0.8579 and 0.8977 respectively, with an average 4.18% improvement across mainstream architectures. By deeply integrating clinical knowledge with imaging features, UMCF provides a new technical pathway for multimodal information fusion in precision medicine.

- **Summary**: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide inherent interpretability by first predicting a set of human-understandable concepts and then mapping them to labels through a simple classifier. While users can intervene in the concept space to improve predictions, traditional CBMs typically employ a fixed linear classifier over concept scores, which restricts interventions to manual value adjustments and prevents the incorporation of new concepts or domain knowledge at test time. These limitations are particularly severe in unsupervised CBMs, where concept activations are often noisy and densely activated, making user interventions ineffective. We introduce Chat-CBM, which replaces score-based classifiers with a language-based classifier that reasons directly over concept semantics. By grounding prediction in the semantic space of concepts, Chat-CBM preserves the interpretability of CBMs while enabling richer and more intuitive interventions, such as concept correction, addition or removal of concepts, incorporation of external knowledge, and high-level reasoning guidance. Leveraging the language understanding and few-shot capabilities of frozen large language models, Chat-CBM extends the intervention interface of CBMs beyond numerical editing and remains effective even in unsupervised settings. Experiments on nine datasets demonstrate that Chat-CBM achieves higher predictive performance and substantially improves user interactivity while maintaining the concept-based interpretability of CBMs.

- **Summary**: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment specific objects in videos based on natural language expressions involving audio, vision, and text information. This task poses significant challenges in cross-modal reasoning and fine-grained object localization. In this paper, we propose a simple framework, SimToken, that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The MLLM is guided to generate a special semantic token representing the referred object. This compact token, enriched with contextual information from all modalities, acts as a prompt to guide SAM to segment objectsacross video frames. To further improve semantic learning, we introduce a novel target-consistent semantic alignment loss that aligns token embeddings from different expressions but referring to the same object. Experiments on the Ref-AVS benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: As generative models are advancing in quality and quantity for creating synthetic content, deepfakes begin to cause online mistrust. Deepfake detectors are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors, systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns correlated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical insights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes uncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy synthetic media detection.



### An Empirical Study on the Robustness of YOLO Models for Underwater Object Detection

- **Summary**: Underwater object detection (UOD) remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to underwater distortions which degrade low-level features and compromise the reliability of even state-of-the-art detectors. While YOLO models have become the backbone of real-time object detection, little work has systematically examined their robustness under these uniquely challenging conditions. This raises a critical question: Are YOLO models genuinely robust when operating under the chaotic and unpredictable conditions of underwater environments? In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive evaluations of recent YOLO variants (YOLOv8-YOLOv12) across six simulated underwater environments. Using a unified dataset of 10,000 annotated images from DUO and Roboflow100, we not only benchmark model robustness but also analyze how distortions affect key low-level features such as texture, edges, and color. Our findings show that (1) YOLOv12 delivers the strongest overall performance but is highly vulnerable to noise, and (2) noise disrupts edge and texture features, explaining the poor detection performance in noisy images. Class imbalance is a persistent challenge in UOD. Experiments revealed that (3) image counts and instance frequency primarily drive detection performance, while object appearance exerts only a secondary influence. Finally, we evaluated lightweight training-aware strategies: noise-aware sample injection, which improves robustness in both noisy and real-world conditions, and fine-tuning with advanced enhancement, which boosts accuracy in enhanced domains but slightly lowers performance in original data, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation, respectively. Together, these insights provide practical guidance for building resilient and cost-efficient UOD systems.

- **Summary**: Modern computer vision is converging on a closed loop in which perception, reasoning and generation mutually reinforce each other. However, this loop remains incomplete: the top-down influence of high-level reasoning on the foundational learning of low-level perceptual features is not yet underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a new paradigm for pretraining foundation models in downstream domains. We introduce Visual insTruction Pretraining (ViTP), a novel approach that directly leverages reasoning to enhance perception. ViTP embeds a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone within a Vision-Language Model and pretrains it end-to-end using a rich corpus of visual instruction data curated from target downstream domains. ViTP is powered by our proposed Visual Robustness Learning (VRL), which compels the ViT to learn robust and domain-relevant features from a sparse set of visual tokens. Extensive experiments on 16 challenging remote sensing and medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that ViTP establishes new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: The automatic diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is in high clinical demand due to its prevalence and the importance of targeted treatment. Current clinical practice often relies on diagnostic biomarkers in QSM and NM-MRI images. However, the lack of large, high-quality datasets makes training diagnostic models from scratch prone to overfitting. Adapting pre-trained 3D medical models is also challenging, as the diversity of medical imaging leads to mismatches in voxel spacing and modality between pre-training and fine-tuning data. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging 2D vision foundation models (VFMs). Specifically, we crop multiple key ROIs from NM and QSM images, process each ROI through separate branches to compress the ROI into a token, and then combine these tokens into a unified patient representation for classification. Within each branch, we use 2D VFMs to encode axial slices of the 3D ROI volume and fuse them into the ROI token, guided by an auxiliary segmentation head that steers the feature extraction toward specific brain nuclei. Additionally, we introduce multi-ROI supervised contrastive learning, which improves diagnostic performance by pulling together representations of patients from the same class while pushing away those from different classes. Our approach achieved first place in the MICCAI 2025 PDCADxFoundation challenge, with an accuracy of 86.0% trained on a dataset of only 300 labeled QSM and NM-MRI scans, outperforming the second-place method by 5.5%.These results highlight the potential of 2D VFMs for clinical analysis of 3D MR images.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel benchmark for camera identification via Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) estimation. The benchmark comprises 13K photos taken with 120+ cameras, where the training and test photos are taken in different scenarios, enabling ``in-the-wild'' evaluation. In addition, we propose a novel PRNU-based camera identification model that employs a hybrid architecture, comprising a denoising autoencoder to estimate the PRNU signal and a convolutional network that can perform 1:N verification of camera devices. Instead of using a conventional approach based on contrastive learning, our method takes the Hadamard product between reference and query PRNU signals as input. This novel design leads to significantly better results compared with state-of-the-art models based on denoising autoencoders and contrastive learning. We release our dataset and code at: https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/PRNU-Bench.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) answer visual questions by transferring information from images to text through a series of attention heads. While this image-to-text information flow is central to visual question answering, its underlying mechanism remains difficult to interpret due to the simultaneous operation of numerous attention heads. To address this challenge, we propose head attribution, a technique inspired by component attribution methods, to identify consistent patterns among attention heads that play a key role in information transfer. Using head attribution, we investigate how LVLMs rely on specific attention heads to identify and answer questions about the main object in an image. Our analysis reveals that a distinct subset of attention heads facilitates the image-to-text information flow. Remarkably, we find that the selection of these heads is governed by the semantic content of the input image rather than its visual appearance. We further examine the flow of information at the token level and discover that (1) text information first propagates to role-related tokens and the final token before receiving image information, and (2) image information is embedded in both object-related and background tokens. Our work provides evidence that image-to-text information flow follows a structured process, and that analysis at the attention-head level offers a promising direction toward understanding the mechanisms of LVLMs.

- **Summary**: Object detection is essential in space applications targeting Space Domain Awareness and also applications involving relative navigation scenarios. Current deep learning models for Object Detection in space applications are often trained on synthetic data from simulators, however, the model performance drops significantly on real-world data due to the domain gap. However, domain adaptive object detection is an overlooked problem in the community. In this work, we first show the importance of domain adaptation and then explore Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) to reduce this gap using minimal labeled real data. We build on a recent semi-supervised adaptation method and tailor it for object detection. Our approach combines domain-invariant feature learning with a CNN-based domain discriminator and invariant risk minimization using a domain-independent regression head. To meet real-time deployment needs, we test our method on a lightweight Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) with MobileNet backbone and on the more advanced Fully Convolutional One-Stage object detector (FCOS) with ResNet-50 backbone. We evaluated on two space datasets, SPEED+ and SPARK. The results show up to 20-point improvements in average precision (AP) with just 250 labeled real images.

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has gained increasing popularity due to its efficacy in addressing ``distribution shift'' issue while simultaneously protecting data privacy.   However, most prior methods assume that a paired source domain model and target domain sharing the same label space coexist, heavily limiting their applicability.   In this paper, we investigate a more general source model capable of adaptation to multiple target domains without needing shared labels.   This is achieved by using a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), \egno, CLIP, that can recognize images through matching with class descriptions.   While the zero-shot performance of VLMs is impressive, they struggle to effectively capture the distinctive attributes of a target domain.   To that end, we propose a novel method -- Context-aware Language-driven TTA (COLA).   The proposed method incorporates a lightweight context-aware module that consists of three key components: a task-aware adapter, a context-aware unit, and a residual connection unit for exploring task-specific knowledge, domain-specific knowledge from the VLM and prior knowledge of the VLM, respectively.   It is worth noting that the context-aware module can be seamlessly integrated into a frozen VLM, ensuring both minimal effort and parameter efficiency.   Additionally, we introduce a Class-Balanced Pseudo-labeling (CBPL) strategy to mitigate the adverse effects caused by class imbalance.   We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method not only in TTA scenarios but also in class generalisation tasks.   The source code is available at https://github.com/NUDT-Bai-Group/COLA-TTA.

- **Summary**: Quadrat images are essential for ecological studies, as they enable standardized sampling, the assessment of plant biodiversity, long-term monitoring, and large-scale field campaigns. These images typically cover an area of fifty centimetres or one square meter, and botanists carefully identify all the species present. Integrating AI could help specialists accelerate their inventories and expand the spatial coverage of ecological studies. To assess progress in this area, the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge relies on a new test set of 2,105 high-resolution multi-label images annotated by experts and covering around 400 species. It also provides a large training set of 1.4 million individual plant images, along with vision transformer models pre-trained on this data. The task is formulated as a (weakly labelled) multi-label classification problem, where the goal is to predict all species present in a quadrat image using single-label training data. This paper provides a detailed description of the data, the evaluation methodology, the methods and models used by participants, and the results achieved.

- **Summary**: Visual anomaly detection is a strongly application-driven field of research. Consequently, the connection between academia and industry is of paramount importance. In this regard, we present the VAND 3.0 Challenge to showcase current progress in anomaly detection across different practical settings whilst addressing critical issues in the field. The challenge hosted two tracks, fostering the development of anomaly detection methods robust against real-world distribution shifts (Category 1) and exploring the capabilities of Vision Language Models within the few-shot regime (Category 2), respectively. The participants' solutions reached significant improvements over previous baselines by combining or adapting existing approaches and fusing them with novel pipelines. While for both tracks the progress in large pre-trained vision (language) backbones played a pivotal role for the performance increase, scaling up anomaly detection methods more efficiently needs to be addressed by future research to meet real-time and computational constraints on-site.

- **Summary**: Estimating camera intrinsic parameters without prior scene knowledge is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. This capability is particularly important for applications such as autonomous driving and vehicle platooning, where precalibrated setups are impractical and real-time adaptability is necessary. To advance the state-of-the-art, we present a set of equations based on the calibrated trifocal tensor, enabling projective camera self-calibration from minimal image data. Our method, termed TrifocalCalib, significantly improves accuracy and robustness compared to both recent learning-based and classical approaches. Unlike many existing techniques, our approach requires no calibration target, imposes no constraints on camera motion, and simultaneously estimates both focal length and principal point. Evaluations in both procedurally generated synthetic environments and structured dataset-based scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To support reproducibility, we make the code publicly available.

- **Summary**: The world is estimated to be home to over 300,000 species of vascular plants. In the face of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, expanding our understanding of these species is crucial for the advancement of human civilization, encompassing areas such as agriculture, construction, and pharmacopoeia. However, the labor-intensive process of plant identification undertaken by human experts poses a significant obstacle to the accumulation of new data and knowledge. Fortunately, recent advancements in automatic identification, particularly through the application of deep learning techniques, have shown promising progress. Despite challenges posed by data-related issues such as a vast number of classes, imbalanced class distribution, erroneous identifications, duplications, variable visual quality, and diverse visual contents (such as photos or herbarium sheets), deep learning approaches have reached a level of maturity which gives us hope that in the near future we will have an identification system capable of accurately identifying all plant species worldwide. The PlantCLEF2023 challenge aims to contribute to this pursuit by addressing a multi-image (and metadata) classification problem involving an extensive set of classes (80,000 plant species). This paper provides an overview of the challenge's resources and evaluations, summarizes the methods and systems employed by participating research groups, and presents an analysis of key findings.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in video insertion based on diffusion models are impressive. However, existing methods rely on complex control signals but struggle with subject consistency, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we focus on the task of Mask-free Video Insertion and aim to resolve three key challenges: data scarcity, subject-scene equilibrium, and insertion harmonization. To address the data scarcity, we propose a new data pipeline InsertPipe, constructing diverse cross-pair data automatically. Building upon our data pipeline, we develop OmniInsert, a novel unified framework for mask-free video insertion from both single and multiple subject references. Specifically, to maintain subject-scene equilibrium, we introduce a simple yet effective Condition-Specific Feature Injection mechanism to distinctly inject multi-source conditions and propose a novel Progressive Training strategy that enables the model to balance feature injection from subjects and source video. Meanwhile, we design the Subject-Focused Loss to improve the detailed appearance of the subjects. To further enhance insertion harmonization, we propose an Insertive Preference Optimization methodology to optimize the model by simulating human preferences, and incorporate a Context-Aware Rephraser module during reference to seamlessly integrate the subject into the original scenes. To address the lack of a benchmark for the field, we introduce InsertBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse scenes with meticulously selected subjects. Evaluation on InsertBench indicates OmniInsert outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source commercial solutions. The code will be released.

- **Summary**: It is estimated that there are more than 300,000 species of vascular plants in the world. Increasing our knowledge of these species is of paramount importance for the development of human civilization (agriculture, construction, pharmacopoeia, etc.), especially in the context of the biodiversity crisis. However, the burden of systematic plant identification by human experts strongly penalizes the aggregation of new data and knowledge. Since then, automatic identification has made considerable progress in recent years as highlighted during all previous editions of PlantCLEF. Deep learning techniques now seem mature enough to address the ultimate but realistic problem of global identification of plant biodiversity in spite of many problems that the data may present (a huge number of classes, very strongly unbalanced classes, partially erroneous identifications, duplications, variable visual quality, diversity of visual contents such as photos or herbarium sheets, etc). The PlantCLEF2022 challenge edition proposes to take a step in this direction by tackling a multi-image (and metadata) classification problem with a very large number of classes (80k plant species). This paper presents the resources and evaluations of the challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and provides an analysis of key findings.

- **Summary**: Thanks to capability to alleviate the cost of large-scale annotation, few-shot action recognition (FSAR) has attracted increased attention of researchers in recent years. Existing FSAR approaches typically neglect the role of individual motion pattern in comparison, and under-explore the feature statistics for video dynamics. Thereby, they struggle to handle the challenging temporal misalignment in video dynamics, particularly by using 2D backbones. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes an adaptively aligned multi-scale second-order moment network, namely A$^2$M$^2$-Net, to describe the latent video dynamics with a collection of powerful representation candidates and adaptively align them in an instance-guided manner. To this end, our A$^2$M$^2$-Net involves two core components, namely, adaptive alignment (A$^2$ module) for matching, and multi-scale second-order moment (M$^2$ block) for strong representation. Specifically, M$^2$ block develops a collection of semantic second-order descriptors at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Furthermore, A$^2$ module aims to adaptively select informative candidate descriptors while considering the individual motion pattern. By such means, our A$^2$M$^2$-Net is able to handle the challenging temporal misalignment problem by establishing an adaptive alignment protocol for strong representation. Notably, our proposed method generalizes well to various few-shot settings and diverse metrics. The experiments are conducted on five widely used FSAR benchmarks, and the results show our A$^2$M$^2$-Net achieves very competitive performance compared to state-of-the-arts, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization.

- **Summary**: Building digital twins of articulated objects from monocular video presents an essential challenge in computer vision, which requires simultaneous reconstruction of object geometry, part segmentation, and articulation parameters from limited viewpoint inputs. Monocular video offers an attractive input format due to its simplicity and scalability; however, it's challenging to disentangle the object geometry and part dynamics with visual supervision alone, as the joint movement of the camera and parts leads to ill-posed estimation. While motion priors from pre-trained tracking models can alleviate the issue, how to effectively integrate them for articulation learning remains largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce VideoArtGS, a novel approach that reconstructs high-fidelity digital twins of articulated objects from monocular video. We propose a motion prior guidance pipeline that analyzes 3D tracks, filters noise, and provides reliable initialization of articulation parameters. We also design a hybrid center-grid part assignment module for articulation-based deformation fields that captures accurate part motion. VideoArtGS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in articulation and mesh reconstruction, reducing the reconstruction error by about two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods. VideoArtGS enables practical digital twin creation from monocular video, establishing a new benchmark for video-based articulated object reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Streaming visual transformers like StreamVGGT achieve strong 3D perception but suffer from unbounded growth of key value (KV) memory, which limits scalability. We propose a training-free, inference-time token eviction policy that bounds memory by discarding redundant tokens while keeping the most informative ones. Our method uses significantly less memory with little to no drop in accuracy: on 7-Scenes with long sequences it reduces peak memory from 18.63 GB to 9.39 GB while accuracy and completeness drop by only 0.003. Under strict memory budgets, eviction enables denser frame sampling, which improves reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline. Experiments across video depth estimation (Sintel, KITTI), 3D reconstruction (7-Scenes, NRGBD), and camera pose estimation (Sintel, TUM-dynamics) show that our approach closely matches StreamVGGT at a fraction of the memory and makes long-horizon streaming inference more practical.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Models have become very popular for Semantic Image Synthesis (SIS) of human faces. Nevertheless, their training and inference is computationally expensive and their computational requirements are high due to the quadratic complexity of attention layers. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called SISMA, based on the recently proposed Mamba. SISMA generates high quality samples by controlling their shape using a semantic mask at a reduced computational demand. We validated our approach through comprehensive experiments with CelebAMask-HQ, revealing that our architecture not only achieves a better FID score yet also operates at three times the speed of state-of-the-art architectures. This indicates that the proposed design is a viable, lightweight substitute to transformer-based models.

- **Summary**: With the development of deep learning technology, virtual try-on technology has become an important application value in the fields of e-commerce, fashion, and entertainment. The recently proposed Leffa has improved the texture distortion problem of diffu-sion-based models, but there are limitations in that the bottom detection inaccuracy and the existing clothing silhouette remain in the synthesis results. To solve this problem, this study proposes CaP-VTON (Clothing agnostic Pre-inpainting Virtual Try-ON). CaP-VTON has improved the naturalness and consistency of whole-body clothing syn-thesis by integrating multi-category masking based on Dress Code and skin inpainting based on Stable Diffusion. In particular, a generate skin module was introduced to solve the skin restoration problem that occurs when long-sleeved images are converted into short-sleeved or sleeveless ones, and high-quality restoration was implemented consider-ing the human body posture and color. As a result, CaP-VTON recorded 92.5%, which is 15.4% better than Leffa in short-sleeved synthesis accuracy, and showed the performance of consistently reproducing the style and shape of reference clothing in visual evaluation. These structures maintain model-agnostic properties and are applicable to various diffu-sion-based virtual inspection systems, and can contribute to applications that require high-precision virtual wearing, such as e-commerce, custom styling, and avatar creation.

This paper aims to make the first attempt to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) foundation model-based method for both screening and staging diagnosis of EGJA using endoscopic images. In this cohort and learning study, we conducted a multicentre study across seven Chinese hospitals between December 28, 2016 and December 30, 2024. It comprises 12,302 images from 1,546 patients; 8,249 of them were employed for model training, while the remaining were divided into the held-out (112 patients, 914 images), external (230 patients, 1,539 images), and prospective (198 patients, 1,600 images) test sets for evaluation. The proposed model employs DINOv2 (a vision foundation model) and ResNet50 (a convolutional neural network) to extract features of global appearance and local details of endoscopic images for EGJA staging diagnosis. Our model demonstrates satisfactory performance for EGJA staging diagnosis across three test sets, achieving an accuracy of 0.9256, 0.8895, and 0.8956, respectively. In contrast, among representative AI models, the best one (ResNet50) achieves an accuracy of 0.9125, 0.8382, and 0.8519 on the three test sets, respectively; the expert endoscopists achieve an accuracy of 0.8147 on the held-out test set. Moreover, with the assistance of our model, the overall accuracy for the trainee, competent, and expert endoscopists improves from 0.7035, 0.7350, and 0.8147 to 0.8497, 0.8521, and 0.8696, respectively. To our knowledge, our model is the first application of foundation models for EGJA staging diagnosis and demonstrates great potential in both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: While vision language models (VLMs) excel in 2D semantic visual understanding, their ability to quantitatively reason about 3D spatial relationships remains under-explored, due to the deficiency of 2D images' spatial representation ability. In this paper, we analyze the problem hindering VLMs' spatial understanding abilities and propose SD-VLM, a novel framework that significantly enhances fundamental spatial perception abilities of VLMs through two key contributions: (1) propose Massive Spatial Measuring and Understanding (MSMU) dataset with precise spatial annotations, and (2) introduce a simple depth positional encoding method strengthening VLMs' spatial awareness. MSMU dataset covers massive quantitative spatial tasks with 700K QA pairs, 2.5M physical numerical annotations, and 10K chain-of-thought augmented samples. We have trained SD-VLM, a strong generalist VLM which shows superior quantitative spatial measuring and understanding capability. SD-VLM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on our proposed MSMU-Bench, but also shows spatial generalization abilities on other spatial understanding benchmarks including Q-Spatial and SpatialRGPT-Bench. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SD-VLM outperforms GPT-4o and Intern-VL3-78B by 26.91% and 25.56% respectively on MSMU-Bench.

- **Summary**: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is a subproblem within Computer Vision Anomaly Detection that has been receiving increasing amounts of attention due to its applicability to real-life scenarios. Recent research has focused on how to extract the most informative features, contrasting older kNN-based methods that use only pretrained features. These recent methods are much more expensive to train however and could complicate real-life application. Careful study of related work with regards to transformation invariance leads to the idea that popular benchmarks require robustness to only minor translations. With this idea we then formulate LWinNN, a local window based approach that creates a middle ground between kNN based methods that have either complete or no translation invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this small change increases accuracy considerably, while simultaneously decreasing both train and test time. This teaches us two things: first, the gap between kNN-based approaches and more complex state-of-the-art methodology can still be narrowed by effective usage of the limited data available. Second, our assumption of requiring only limited translation invariance highlights potential areas of interest for future work and the need for more spatially diverse benchmarks, for which our method can hopefully serve as a new baseline.

- **Summary**: This paper evaluates DINOv3, a recent large-scale self-supervised vision backbone, for visuomotor diffusion policy learning in robotic manipulation. We investigate whether a purely self-supervised encoder can match or surpass conventional supervised ImageNet-pretrained backbones (e.g., ResNet-18) under three regimes: training from scratch, frozen, and finetuned. Across four benchmark tasks (Push-T, Lift, Can, Square) using a unified FiLM-conditioned diffusion policy, we find that (i) finetuned DINOv3 matches or exceeds ResNet-18 on several tasks, (ii) frozen DINOv3 remains competitive, indicating strong transferable priors, and (iii) self-supervised features improve sample efficiency and robustness. These results support self-supervised large visual models as effective, generalizable perceptual front-ends for action diffusion policies, motivating further exploration of scalable label-free pretraining in robotic manipulation. Compared to using ResNet18 as a backbone, our approach with DINOv3 achieves up to a 10% absolute increase in test-time success rates on challenging tasks such as Can, and on-the-par performance in tasks like Lift, PushT, and Square.

- **Summary**: Depth imaging is a crucial area in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), as it plays a key role in detecting and measuring objects in the vehicle's surroundings. However, a significant challenge in this domain arises from missing information in Depth images, where certain points are not measurable due to gaps or inconsistencies in pixel data. Our research addresses two key tasks to overcome this challenge. First, we developed an algorithm using a multi-layered training approach to generate Depth images from a single RGB image. Second, we addressed the issue of missing information in Depth images by applying our algorithm to rectify these gaps, resulting in Depth images with complete and accurate data. We further tested our algorithm on the Cityscapes dataset and successfully resolved the missing information in its Depth images, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in real-world urban environments.

- **Summary**: LoRA has become one of the most widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, numerous studies have shown that LoRA often introduces substantial parameter redundancy, which not only increases the number of trainable parameters but also hinders the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Since identifying redundant parameters in LoRA is inherently difficult, how to eliminate them efficiently and accurately remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose TASO, a redundancy reduction method that leverages importance information from the pretrained model's weights to mitigate LoRA redundancy. Specifically, we estimate parameter importance on downstream tasks and identify task-specific core regions based on the distribution of importance scores. The location information of these core regions is then used to determine the sparse structure of LoRA modules, enabling redundancy removal before fine-tuning. Our approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for task adaptation, while providing a novel task-aligned perspective for LoRA redundancy reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that, with a parameter budget comparable to LoRA with rank $r = 1$, TASO consistently outperforms standard LoRA across multiple tasks, achieving strong fine-tuning performance while effectively eliminating redundant parameters.

- **Summary**: Face Recognition (FR) plays a crucial role in many critical (high-stakes) applications, where errors in the recognition process can lead to serious consequences. Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) techniques enhance FR systems by providing quality estimates of face samples, enabling the systems to discard samples that are unsuitable for reliable recognition or lead to low-confidence recognition decisions. Most state-of-the-art FIQA techniques rely on extensive supervised training to achieve accurate quality estimation. In contrast, unsupervised techniques eliminate the need for additional training but tend to be slower and typically exhibit lower performance. In this paper, we introduce FROQ (Face Recognition Observer of Quality), a semi-supervised, training-free approach that leverages specific intermediate representations within a given FR model to estimate face-image quality, and combines the efficiency of supervised FIQA models with the training-free approach of unsupervised methods. A simple calibration step based on pseudo-quality labels allows FROQ to uncover specific representations, useful for quality assessment, in any modern FR model. To generate these pseudo-labels, we propose a novel unsupervised FIQA technique based on sample perturbations. Comprehensive experiments with four state-of-the-art FR models and eight benchmark datasets show that FROQ leads to highly competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving both strong performance and efficient runtime, without requiring explicit training.

- **Summary**: Autonomous robotic systems applied to new domains require an abundance of expensive, pixel-level dense labels to train robust semantic segmentation models under full supervision. This study proposes a model-agnostic Depth Edge Alignment Loss to improve Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation models across different datasets. The methodology generates pixel-level semantic labels from image-level supervision, avoiding expensive annotation processes. While weak supervision is widely explored in traditional computer vision, our approach adds supervision with pixel-level depth information, a modality commonly available in robotic systems. We demonstrate how our approach improves segmentation performance across datasets and models, but can also be combined with other losses for even better performance, with improvements up to +5.439, +1.274 and +16.416 points in mean Intersection over Union on the PASCAL VOC / MS COCO validation, and the HOPE static onboarding split, respectively. Our code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) is a crucial technique in image processing, with a key challenge being the generation of decision maps with precise boundaries. However, traditional methods based on heuristic rules and deep learning methods with black-box mechanisms are difficult to generate high-quality decision maps. To overcome this challenge, we introduce neurodynamics-driven coupled neural P (CNP) systems, which are third-generation neural computation models inspired by spiking mechanisms, to enhance the accuracy of decision maps. Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the model's neurodynamics to identify the constraints between the network parameters and the input signals. This solid analysis avoids abnormal continuous firing of neurons and ensures the model accurately distinguishes between focused and unfocused regions, generating high-quality decision maps for MFIF. Based on this analysis, we propose a \textbf{N}eurodynamics-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{CNP} \textbf{F}usion model (\textbf{ND-CNPFuse}) tailored for the challenging MFIF task. Unlike current ideas of decision map generation, ND-CNPFuse distinguishes between focused and unfocused regions by mapping the source image into interpretable spike matrices. By comparing the number of spikes, an accurate decision map can be generated directly without any post-processing. Extensive experimental results show that ND-CNPFuse achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four classical MFIF datasets, including Lytro, MFFW, MFI-WHU, and Real-MFF. The code is available at https://github.com/MorvanLi/ND-CNPFuse.

- **Summary**: The standardisation of Intermodal Loading Units (ILUs), such as containers, semi-trailers and swap bodies, has revolutionised global trade yet their efficient and robust identification remains a critical bottleneck in high-throughput ports and terminals. This paper reviews 63 empirical studies that propose computer vision (CV) based solutions. It covers the last 35 years (1990-2025), tracing the field's evolution from early digital image processing (DIP) and traditional machine learning (ML) to the current dominance of deep learning (DL) techniques. While CV offers cost-effective alternatives for other types of identification techniques, its development is hindered by the lack of publicly available benchmarking datasets. This results in high variance for the reported results such as end-to-end accuracy ranging from 5 % to 96 %. Beyond dataset limitations, this review highlights the emerging challenges especially introduced by the shift from character-based text recognition to scene-text spotting and the integration of mobile cameras (e.g. drones, sensor equipped ground vehicles) for dynamic terminal monitoring. To advance the field, the paper calls for standardised terminology, open-access datasets, shared source code, while outlining future research directions such as contextless text recognition optimised for ISO6346 codes.

- **Summary**: Radar-camera fusion methods have emerged as a cost-effective approach for 3D object detection but still lag behind LiDAR-based methods in performance. Recent works have focused on employing temporal fusion and Knowledge Distillation (KD) strategies to overcome these limitations. However, existing approaches have not sufficiently accounted for uncertainties arising from object motion or sensor-specific errors inherent in radar and camera modalities. In this work, we propose RCTDistill, a novel cross-modal KD method based on temporal fusion, comprising three key modules: Range-Azimuth Knowledge Distillation (RAKD), Temporal Knowledge Distillation (TKD), and Region-Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (RDKD). RAKD is designed to consider the inherent errors in the range and azimuth directions, enabling effective knowledge transfer from LiDAR features to refine inaccurate BEV representations. TKD mitigates temporal misalignment caused by dynamic objects by aligning historical radar-camera BEV features with current LiDAR representations. RDKD enhances feature discrimination by distilling relational knowledge from the teacher model, allowing the student to differentiate foreground and background features. RCTDistill achieves state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion performance on both the nuScenes and View-of-Delft (VoD) datasets, with the fastest inference speed of 26.2 FPS.

- **Summary**: Accurate anatomical labeling of intracranial arteries is essential for cerebrovascular diagnosis and hemodynamic analysis but remains time-consuming and subject to interoperator variability. We present a deep learning-based framework for automated artery labeling from 3D Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (3D ToF-MRA) segmentations (n=35), incorporating uncertainty quantification to enhance interpretability and reliability. We evaluated three convolutional neural network architectures: (1) a UNet with residual encoder blocks, reflecting commonly used baselines in vascular labeling; (2) CS-Net, an attention-augmented UNet incorporating channel and spatial attention mechanisms for enhanced curvilinear structure recognition; and (3) nnUNet, a self-configuring framework that automates preprocessing, training, and architectural adaptation based on dataset characteristics. Among these, nnUNet achieved the highest labeling performance (average Dice score: 0.922; average surface distance: 0.387 mm), with improved robustness in anatomically complex vessels. To assess predictive confidence, we implemented test-time augmentation (TTA) and introduced a novel coordinate-guided strategy to reduce interpolation errors during augmented inference. The resulting uncertainty maps reliably indicated regions of anatomical ambiguity, pathological variation, or manual labeling inconsistency. We further validated clinical utility by comparing flow velocities derived from automated and manual labels in co-registered 4D Flow MRI datasets, observing close agreement with no statistically significant differences. Our framework offers a scalable, accurate, and uncertainty-aware solution for automated cerebrovascular labeling, supporting downstream hemodynamic analysis and facilitating clinical integration.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-textual reasoning, with Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting significantly enhancing interpretability. However, existing MCoT methods rely on rationale-rich datasets and largely focus on inter-object reasoning, overlooking the intra-object understanding crucial for image classification. To address this gap, we propose WISE, a Weak-supervision-guided Step-by-step Explanation method that augments any image classification dataset with MCoTs by reformulating the concept-based representations from Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) into concise, interpretable reasoning chains under weak supervision. Experiments across ten datasets show that our generated MCoTs not only improve interpretability by 37% but also lead to gains in classification accuracy when used to fine-tune MLLMs. Our work bridges concept-based interpretability and generative MCoT reasoning, providing a generalizable framework for enhancing MLLMs in fine-grained visual understanding.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating program workflows for visual tasks. However, previous approaches often rely on closed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form video question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce the FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that balances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult ones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and subtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a diverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align open-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as FS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple queries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual program reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this process, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage slow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated if the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through parameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the parameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are generated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected, while during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is applied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and reliability in visual program workflows. It achieves 50.4% accuracy on LVBench, surpassing GPT-4o, matching the performance of Qwen2.5VL-72B on VideoMME.

- **Summary**: Real-world datasets often exhibit class imbalance across multiple categories, manifesting as long-tailed distributions and few-shot scenarios. This is especially challenging in Class-Imbalanced Multi-Label Image Classification (CI-MLIC) tasks, where data imbalance and multi-object recognition present significant obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method termed Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical Prompt (HP-DVAL), which leverages multi-modal knowledge from vision-language pretrained (VLP) models to mitigate the class-imbalance problem in multi-label settings. Specifically, HP-DVAL employs dual-view alignment learning to transfer the powerful feature representation capabilities from VLP models by extracting complementary features for accurate image-text alignment. To better adapt VLP models for CI-MLIC tasks, we introduce a hierarchical prompt-tuning strategy that utilizes global and local prompts to learn task-specific and context-related prior knowledge. Additionally, we design a semantic consistency loss during prompt tuning to prevent learned prompts from deviating from general knowledge embedded in VLP models. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on two CI-MLIC benchmarks: MS-COCO and VOC2007. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches, achieving mAP improvements of 10.0\% and 5.2\% on the long-tailed multi-label image classification task, and 6.8\% and 2.9\% on the multi-label few-shot image classification task.

- **Summary**: Neural fields offer continuous, learnable representations that extend beyond traditional discrete formats in visual computing. We study the problem of learning neural representations of repeated antiderivatives directly from a function, a continuous analogue of summed-area tables. Although widely used in discrete domains, such cumulative schemes rely on grids, which prevents their applicability in continuous neural contexts. We introduce and analyze a range of neural methods for repeated integration, including both adaptations of prior work and novel designs. Our evaluation spans multiple input dimensionalities and integration orders, assessing both reconstruction quality and performance in downstream tasks such as filtering and rendering. These results enable integrating classical cumulative operators into modern neural systems and offer insights into learning tasks involving differential and integral operators.

- **Summary**: Amodal completion, generating invisible parts of occluded objects, is vital for applications like image editing and AR. Prior methods face challenges with data needs, generalization, or error accumulation in progressive pipelines. We propose a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework based on upfront collaborative reasoning to overcome these issues. Our framework uses multiple agents to collaboratively analyze occlusion relationships and determine necessary boundary expansion, yielding a precise mask for inpainting. Concurrently, an agent generates fine-grained textual descriptions, enabling Fine-Grained Semantic Guidance. This ensures accurate object synthesis and prevents the regeneration of occluders or other unwanted elements, especially within large inpainting areas. Furthermore, our method directly produces layered RGBA outputs guided by visible masks and attention maps from a Diffusion Transformer, eliminating extra segmentation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art visual quality.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes Neural-MMGS, a novel neural 3DGS framework for multimodal large-scale scene reconstruction that fuses multiple sensing modalities in a per-gaussian compact, learnable embedding. While recent works focusing on large-scale scene reconstruction have incorporated LiDAR data to provide more accurate geometric constraints, we argue that LiDAR's rich physical properties remain underexplored. Similarly, semantic information has been used for object retrieval, but could provide valuable high-level context for scene reconstruction. Traditional approaches append these properties to Gaussians as separate parameters, increasing memory usage and limiting information exchange across modalities. Instead, our approach fuses all modalities -- image, LiDAR, and semantics -- into a compact, learnable embedding that implicitly encodes optical, physical, and semantic features in each Gaussian. We then train lightweight neural decoders to map these embeddings to Gaussian parameters, enabling the reconstruction of each sensing modality with lower memory overhead and improved scalability. We evaluate Neural-MMGS on the Oxford Spires and KITTI-360 datasets. On Oxford Spires, we achieve higher-quality reconstructions, while on KITTI-360, our method reaches competitive results with less storage consumption compared with current approaches in LiDAR-based novel-view synthesis.

- **Summary**: We present Qwen3-Omni, a single multimodal model that, for the first time, maintains state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, and video without any degradation relative to single-modal counterparts. Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source SOTA on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe. Qwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker-Talker MoE architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages, and speech generation in 10 languages. To reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings, Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms. To further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking, and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.

- **Summary**: As the third generation of neural networks, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained widespread attention for their biological plausibility, energy efficiency, and effectiveness in processing neuromorphic datasets. To better emulate biological neurons, various models such as Integrate-and-Fire (IF) and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) have been widely adopted in SNNs. However, these neuron models overlook the refractory period, a fundamental characteristic of biological neurons. Research on excitable neurons reveal that after firing, neurons enter a refractory period during which they are temporarily unresponsive to subsequent stimuli. This mechanism is critical for preventing over-excitation and mitigating interference from aberrant signals. Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective method to incorporate the refractory period into spiking LIF neurons through spike-triggered threshold dynamics, termed RPLIF. Our method ensures that each spike accurately encodes neural information, effectively preventing neuron over-excitation under continuous inputs and interference from anomalous inputs. Incorporating the refractory period into LIF neurons is seamless and computationally efficient, enhancing robustness and efficiency while yielding better performance with negligible overhead. To the best of our knowledge, RPLIF achieves state-of-the-art performance on Cifar10-DVS(82.40%) and N-Caltech101(83.35%) with fewer timesteps and demonstrates superior performance on DVS128 Gesture(97.22%) at low latency.

- **Summary**: The rapid progress of image-guided video generation (I2V) has raised concerns about its potential misuse in misinformation and fraud, underscoring the urgent need for effective digital watermarking. While existing watermarking methods demonstrate robustness within a single modality, they fail to trace source images in I2V settings. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of Robust Diffusion Distance, which measures the temporal persistence of watermark signals in generated videos. Building on this, we propose I2VWM, a cross-modal watermarking framework designed to enhance watermark robustness across time. I2VWM leverages a video-simulation noise layer during training and employs an optical-flow-based alignment module during inference. Experiments on both open-source and commercial I2V models demonstrate that I2VWM significantly improves robustness while maintaining imperceptibility, establishing a new paradigm for cross-modal watermarking in the era of generative video. \href{https://github.com/MrCrims/I2VWM-Robust-Watermarking-for-Image-to-Video-Generation}{Code Released.}

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the challenges associated with merging low-rank adaptations of large neural networks. With the rise of parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), model fine-tuning has become more accessible. While fine-tuning models with LoRA is highly efficient, existing merging methods often sacrifice this efficiency by merging fully-sized weight matrices. We propose the Core Space merging framework, which enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis, thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while utilizing a fraction of the computational resources.

- **Summary**: Underwater image degradation poses significant challenges for 3D reconstruction, where simplified physical models often fail in complex scenes. We propose \textbf{R-Splatting}, a unified framework that bridges underwater image restoration (UIR) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve both rendering quality and geometric fidelity. Our method integrates multiple enhanced views produced by diverse UIR models into a single reconstruction pipeline. During inference, a lightweight illumination generator samples latent codes to support diverse yet coherent renderings, while a contrastive loss ensures disentangled and stable illumination representations. Furthermore, we propose \textit{Uncertainty-Aware Opacity Optimization (UAOO)}, which models opacity as a stochastic function to regularize training. This suppresses abrupt gradient responses triggered by illumination variation and mitigates overfitting to noisy or view-specific artifacts. Experiments on Seathru-NeRF and our new BlueCoral3D dataset demonstrate that R-Splatting outperforms strong baselines in both rendering quality and geometric accuracy.

- **Summary**: Real-world images often suffer from spatially diverse degradations such as haze, rain, snow, and low-light, significantly impacting visual quality and downstream vision tasks. Existing all-in-one restoration (AIR) approaches either depend on external text prompts or embed hand-crafted architectural priors (e.g., frequency heuristics); both impose discrete, brittle assumptions that weaken generalization to unseen or mixed degradations. To address this limitation, we propose to reframe AIR as learned latent prior inference, where degradation-aware representations are automatically inferred from the input without explicit task cues. Based on latent priors, we formulate AIR as a structured reasoning paradigm: (1) which features to route (adaptive feature selection), (2) where to restore (spatial localization), and (3) what to restore (degradation semantics). We design a lightweight decoding module that efficiently leverages these latent encoded cues for spatially-adaptive restoration. Extensive experiments across six common degradation tasks, five compound settings, and previously unseen degradations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, achieving an average PSNR improvement of 1.68 dB while being three times more efficient.

- **Summary**: Medical time series (MedTS) classification is pivotal for intelligent healthcare, yet its efficacy is severely limited by poor cross-subject generation due to the profound cross-individual heterogeneity. Despite advances in architectural innovations and transfer learning techniques, current methods remain constrained by modality-specific inductive biases that limit their ability to learn universally invariant representations. To overcome this, we propose TS-P$^2$CL, a novel plug-and-play framework that leverages the universal pattern recognition capabilities of pre-trained vision models. We introduce a vision-guided paradigm that transforms 1D physiological signals into 2D pseudo-images, establishing a bridge to the visual domain. This transformation enables implicit access to rich semantic priors learned from natural images. Within this unified space, we employ a dual-contrastive learning strategy: intra-modal consistency enforces temporal coherence, while cross-modal alignment aligns time-series dynamics with visual semantics, thereby mitigating individual-specific biases and learning robust, domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments on six MedTS datasets demonstrate that TS-P$^2$CL consistently outperforms fourteen methods in both subject-dependent and subject-independent settings.

- **Summary**: Objective: To systematically quantify the effect of the camera view (frontal vs. lateral) on the accuracy of 2D markerless gait analysis relative to 3D motion capture ground truth. Methods: Gait data from 18 subjects were recorded simultaneously using frontal, lateral and 3D motion capture systems. Pose estimation used YOLOv8. Four metrics were assessed to evaluate agreement: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for temporal alignment, Maximum Cross-Correlation (MCC) for signal similarity, Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) for distribution differences, and Information Entropy (IE) for complexity. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (significance: $p < 0.05$) and Cliff's delta ($\delta$) were used to measure statistical differences and effect sizes. Results: Lateral views significantly outperformed frontal views for sagittal plane kinematics: step length (DTW: $53.08 \pm 24.50$ vs. $69.87 \pm 25.36$, $p = 0.005$) and knee rotation (DTW: $106.46 \pm 38.57$ vs. $155.41 \pm 41.77$, $p = 0.004$). Frontal views were superior for symmetry parameters: trunk rotation (KLD: $0.09 \pm 0.06$ vs. $0.30 \pm 0.19$, $p < 0.001$) and wrist-to-hipmid distance (MCC: $105.77 \pm 29.72$ vs. $75.20 \pm 20.38$, $p = 0.003$). Effect sizes were medium-to-large ($\delta: 0.34$--$0.76$). Conclusion: Camera view critically impacts gait parameter accuracy. Lateral views are optimal for sagittal kinematics; frontal views excel for trunk symmetry. Significance: This first systematic evidence enables data-driven camera deployment in 2D gait analysis, enhancing clinical utility. Future implementations should leverage both views via disease-oriented setups.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a central paradigm for training foundation models by leveraging large-scale unlabeled datasets, often producing representations with strong generalization capabilities. These models are typically pre-trained on general-purpose datasets such as ImageNet and subsequently adapted to various downstream tasks through finetuning. While recent advances have explored parameter-efficient strategies for adapting pre-trained models, extending SSL pre-training itself to new domains - particularly under limited data regimes and for dense prediction tasks - remains underexplored. In this work, we address the problem of adapting vision foundation models to new domains in an unsupervised and data-efficient manner, specifically targeting downstream semantic segmentation. We propose GLARE (Global Local and Regional Enforcement), a novel continual self-supervised pre-training task designed to enhance downstream segmentation performance. GLARE introduces patch-level augmentations to encourage local consistency and incorporates a regional consistency constraint that leverages spatial semantics in the data. For efficient continual pre-training, we initialize Vision Transformers (ViTs) with weights from existing SSL models and update only lightweight adapter modules - specifically UniAdapter - while keeping the rest of the backbone frozen. Experiments across multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks on different domains demonstrate that GLARE consistently improves downstream performance with minimal computational and parameter overhead.

- **Summary**: Training-free video object editing aims to achieve precise object-level manipulation, including object insertion, swapping, and deletion. However, it faces significant challenges in maintaining fidelity and temporal consistency. Existing methods, often designed for U-Net architectures, suffer from two primary limitations: inaccurate inversion due to first-order solvers, and contextual conflicts caused by crude "hard" feature replacement. These issues are more challenging in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), where the unsuitability of prior layer-selection heuristics makes effective guidance challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce ContextFlow, a novel training-free framework for DiT-based video object editing. In detail, we first employ a high-order Rectified Flow solver to establish a robust editing foundation. The core of our framework is Adaptive Context Enrichment (for specifying what to edit), a mechanism that addresses contextual conflicts. Instead of replacing features, it enriches the self-attention context by concatenating Key-Value pairs from parallel reconstruction and editing paths, empowering the model to dynamically fuse information. Additionally, to determine where to apply this enrichment (for specifying where to edit), we propose a systematic, data-driven analysis to identify task-specific vital layers. Based on a novel Guidance Responsiveness Metric, our method pinpoints the most influential DiT blocks for different tasks (e.g., insertion, swapping), enabling targeted and highly effective guidance. Extensive experiments show that ContextFlow significantly outperforms existing training-free methods and even surpasses several state-of-the-art training-based approaches, delivering temporally coherent, high-fidelity results.

- **Summary**: Synthetic data generation in histopathology faces unique challenges: preserving tissue heterogeneity, capturing subtle morphological features, and scaling to unannotated datasets. We present a latent diffusion model that generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100 tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within 1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.

- **Summary**: Achieving truly practical dynamic 3D reconstruction requires online operation, global pose and map consistency, detailed appearance modeling, and the flexibility to handle both RGB and RGB-D inputs. However, existing SLAM methods typically merely remove the dynamic parts or require RGB-D input, while offline methods are not scalable to long video sequences, and current transformer-based feedforward methods lack global consistency and appearance details. To this end, we achieve online dynamic scene reconstruction by disentangling the static and dynamic parts within a SLAM system. The poses are tracked robustly with a novel motion masking strategy, and dynamic parts are reconstructed leveraging a progressive adaptation of a Motion Scaffolds graph. Our method yields novel view renderings competitive to offline methods and achieves on-par tracking with state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods.

- **Summary**: Autonomous inspection is a central problem in robotics, with applications ranging from industrial monitoring to search-and-rescue. Traditionally, inspection has often been reduced to navigation tasks, where the objective is to reach a predefined location while avoiding obstacles. However, this formulation captures only part of the real inspection problem. In real-world environments, the inspection targets may become visible well before their exact coordinates are reached, making further movement both redundant and inefficient. What matters more for inspection is not simply arriving at the target's position, but positioning the robot at a viewpoint from which the target becomes observable. In this work, we revisit inspection from a perception-aware perspective. We propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that explicitly incorporates target visibility as the primary objective, enabling the robot to find the shortest trajectory that guarantees visual contact with the target without relying on a map. The learned policy leverages both perceptual and proprioceptive sensing and is trained entirely in simulation, before being deployed to a real-world robot. We further develop an algorithm to compute ground-truth shortest inspection paths, which provides a reference for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method outperforms existing classical and learning-based navigation approaches, yielding more efficient inspection trajectories in both simulated and real-world settings.

- **Summary**: This study examines how Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) members are trained using mixed-reality simulations that replicate the high-pressure conditions of aeromedical evacuation. Each team - a physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist - must stabilize severely injured soldiers by managing ventilators, IV pumps, and suction devices during flight. Proficient performance requires clinical expertise and cognitive skills, such as situational awareness, rapid decision-making, effective communication, and coordinated task management, all of which must be maintained under stress. Recent advances in simulation and multimodal data analytics enable more objective and comprehensive performance evaluation. In contrast, traditional instructor-led assessments are subjective and may overlook critical events, thereby limiting generalizability and consistency. However, AI-based automated and more objective evaluation metrics still demand human input to train the AI algorithms to assess complex team dynamics in the presence of environmental noise and the need for accurate re-identification in multi-person tracking. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic, data-driven assessment framework that combines Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) with Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA). We have developed a domain-specific CTA model for CCATT training and a vision-based action recognition pipeline using a fine-tuned Human-Object Interaction model, the Cascade Disentangling Network (CDN), to detect and track trainee-equipment interactions over time. These interactions automatically yield performance indicators (e.g., reaction time, task duration), which are mapped onto a hierarchical CTA model tailored to CCATT operations, enabling interpretable, domain-relevant performance evaluations.

- **Summary**: Modern multimodal large language models often claim "video understanding," yet most evaluations use muted videos or simply discard audio. We ask a direct question: how much does audio actually matter for contemporary Video-LLMs and the benchmarks that certify them? We audit widely used suites and observe that many items are even solvable from a single frame, rendering audio largely redundant. Building on LLaVA-OneVision architecture, we attach a speech/audio encoder (e.g., Whisper) and analyze when audio helps, while addressing audio token explosion with a lightweight Mamba-based state-space token compressor. We find that audio yields minimal gains on recent video benchmarks but is decisive on curated, audio-sensitive subsets. To enable faithful evaluation, we release AVQA-Hard and Music-AVQA-Hard, our model, and code. Our findings surface a growing gap between current academic practice and real-world expectations, and provide practical tools for scalable audio-visual Video-LLMs. We will fully open-source our work at https://github.com/naver-ai/LLaVA-AV-SSM.

- **Summary**: Reliable brain tumor segmentation in MRI is indispensable for treatment planning and outcome monitoring, yet models trained on curated benchmarks often fail under domain shifts arising from scanner and protocol variability as well as population heterogeneity. Such gaps are especially severe in low-resource and pediatric cohorts, where conventional test-time or source-free adaptation strategies often suffer from instability and structural inconsistency. We propose SmaRT, a style-modulated robust test-time adaptation framework that enables source-free cross-domain generalization. SmaRT integrates style-aware augmentation to mitigate appearance discrepancies, a dual-branch momentum strategy for stable pseudo-label refinement, and structural priors enforcing consistency, integrity, and connectivity. This synergy ensures both adaptation stability and anatomical fidelity under extreme domain shifts. Extensive evaluations on sub-Saharan Africa and pediatric glioma datasets show that SmaRT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with notable gains in Dice accuracy and boundary precision. Overall, SmaRT bridges the gap between algorithmic advances and equitable clinical applicability, supporting robust deployment of MRI-based neuro-oncology tools in diverse clinical environments.

- **Summary**: Accurate multi-needle localization in intraoperative CT images is crucial for optimizing seed placement in pelvic seed implant brachytherapy. However, this task is challenging due to poor image contrast and needle adhesion. This paper presents a novel approach that reframes needle localization as a tip-handle detection and matching problem to overcome these difficulties. An anchor-free network, based on HRNet, is proposed to extract multi-scale features and accurately detect needle tips and handles by predicting their centers and orientations using decoupled branches for heatmap regression and polar angle prediction. To associate detected tips and handles into individual needles, a greedy matching and merging (GMM) method designed to solve the unbalanced assignment problem with constraints (UAP-C) is presented. The GMM method iteratively selects the most probable tip-handle pairs and merges them based on a distance metric to reconstruct 3D needle paths. Evaluated on a dataset of 100 patients, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher precision and F1 score compared to a segmentation-based method utilizing the nnUNet model,thereby offering a more robust and accurate solution for needle localization in complex clinical scenarios.

- **Summary**: End-to-end autonomous driving has substantially progressed by directly predicting future trajectories from raw perception inputs, which bypasses traditional modular pipelines. However, mainstream methods trained via imitation learning suffer from critical safety limitations, as they fail to distinguish between trajectories that appear human-like but are potentially unsafe. Some recent approaches attempt to address this by regressing multiple rule-driven scores but decoupling supervision from policy optimization, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose DriveDPO, a Safety Direct Preference Optimization Policy Learning framework. First, we distill a unified policy distribution from human imitation similarity and rule-based safety scores for direct policy optimization. Further, we introduce an iterative Direct Preference Optimization stage formulated as trajectory-level preference alignment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that DriveDPO achieves a new state-of-the-art PDMS of 90.0. Furthermore, qualitative results across diverse challenging scenarios highlight DriveDPO's ability to produce safer and more reliable driving behaviors.

- **Summary**: This paper considers the problem of enabling robots to navigate dynamic environments while following instructions. The challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can include multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification combinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example, "overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road" consists of two specifications: "overtake the pedestrian" and "walk on the right side of the road." To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the intuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its constituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive. Using diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then composes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of specifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for demonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training procedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for dynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the base model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions by generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of specifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based policies and costmap composing baselines.

- **Summary**: Combining multimodal data is a key issue in a wide range of machine learning tasks, including many remote sensing problems. In Earth observation, early multimodal data fusion methods were based on specific neural network architectures and supervised learning. Ever since, the scarcity of labeled data has motivated self-supervised learning techniques. State-of-the-art multimodal representation learning techniques leverage the spatial alignment between satellite data from different modalities acquired over the same geographic area in order to foster a semantic alignment in the latent space. In this paper, we investigate how this methods can preserve task-relevant information that is not shared across modalities. First, we show, under simplifying assumptions, when alignment strategies fundamentally lead to an information loss. Then, we support our theoretical insight through numerical experiments in more realistic settings. With those theoretical and empirical evidences, we hope to support new developments in contrastive learning for the combination of multimodal satellite data.

- **Summary**: Extracting polygonal roofs and footprints from remote sensing images is critical for large-scale urban analysis. Most existing methods rely on segmentation-based models that assume clear semantic boundaries of roofs, but these approaches struggle in off- nadir images, where the roof and footprint are significantly displaced, and facade pixels are fused with the roof boundary. With the increasing availability of open vector map annotations, e.g., OpenStreetMap, utilizing historical labels for off-nadir image annotation has become viable because remote sensing images are georeferenced once captured. However, these historical labels commonly suffer from significant positional discrepancies with new images and only have one annotation (roof or footprint), which fails to describe the correct structures of a building. To address these discrepancies, we first introduce a concept of an alignment token, which encodes the correction vector to guide the label correction. Based on this concept, we then propose Drag OpenStreetMap Labels (DragOSM), a novel model designed to align dislocated historical labels with roofs and footprints. Specifically, DragOSM formulates the label alignment as an interactive denoising process, modeling the positional discrepancy as a Gaussian distribution. During training, it learns to correct these errors by simulating misalignment with random Gaussian perturbations; during inference, it iteratively refines the positions of input labels. To validate our method, we further present a new dataset, Repairing Buildings in OSM (ReBO), comprising 179,265 buildings with both OpenStreetMap and manually corrected annotations across 5,473 images from 41 cities. Experimental results on ReBO demonstrate the effectiveness of DragOSM. Code, dataset, and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/likaiucas/DragOSM.git.

- **Summary**: The modeling of complicated time-evolving physical dynamics from partial observations is a long-standing challenge. Particularly, observations can be sparsely distributed in a seemingly random or unstructured manner, making it difficult to capture highly nonlinear features in a variety of scientific and engineering problems. However, existing data-driven approaches are often constrained by fixed spatial and temporal discretization. While some researchers attempt to achieve spatio-temporal continuity by designing novel strategies, they either overly rely on traditional numerical methods or fail to truly overcome the limitations imposed by discretization. To address these, we propose CoPS, a purely data-driven methods, to effectively model continuous physics simulation from partial observations. Specifically, we employ multiplicative filter network to fuse and encode spatial information with the corresponding observations. Then we customize geometric grids and use message-passing mechanism to map features from original spatial domain to the customized grids. Subsequently, CoPS models continuous-time dynamics by designing multi-scale graph ODEs, while introducing a Markov-based neural auto-correction module to assist and constrain the continuous extrapolations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS advances the state-of-the-art methods in space-time continuous modeling across various scenarios.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are powerful, yet their high complexity greatly limits their potential to be deployed on billions of resource-constrained edge devices. Pruning is a crucial network compression technique, yet most existing methods focus on classification models, with limited attention to detection. Even among those addressing detection, there is a lack of utilization of essential localization information. Also, many pruning methods passively rely on pre-trained models, in which useful and useless components are intertwined, making it difficult to remove the latter without harming the former at the neuron/filter level. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a proactive detection-discriminants-based network compression approach for deep visual detectors, which alternates between two steps: (1) maximizing and compressing detection-related discriminants and aligning them with a subset of neurons/filters immediately before the detection head, and (2) tracing the detection-related discriminating power across the layers and discarding features of lower importance. Object location information is exploited in both steps. Extensive experiments, employing four advanced detection models and four state-of-the-art competing methods on the KITTI and COCO datasets, highlight the superiority of our approach. Remarkably, our compressed models can even beat the original base models with a substantial reduction in complexity.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in diverse applications, but the problems of high latency and energy overhead are inevitable on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, most researchers focus on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the latency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of processors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and not fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a significant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing frequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a model-based and data-driven method. Then by combining with the fitting parameters of different DNN models, we give a preliminary analysis for the proposed model to see the effects of adjusting memory frequency and computing frequency simultaneously. Finally, simulation results in local inference and cooperative inference cases further validate the effectiveness of jointly scaling the memory frequency and computing frequency to reduce the energy consumption of devices.



### Intra-Cluster Mixup: An Effective Data Augmentation Technique for Complementary-Label Learning

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the challenges of complementary-label learning (CLL), a specialized form of weakly-supervised learning (WSL) where models are trained with labels indicating classes to which instances do not belong, rather than standard ordinary labels. This alternative supervision is appealing because collecting complementary labels is generally cheaper and less labor-intensive. Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the development of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this domain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the widely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly applied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the complementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance of CLL models. We then propose an improved technique called Intra-Cluster Mixup (ICM), which only synthesizes augmented data from nearby examples, to mitigate the noise effect. ICM carries the benefits of encouraging complementary label sharing of nearby examples, and leads to substantial performance improvements across synthetic and real-world labeled datasets. In particular, our wide spectrum of experimental results on both balanced and imbalanced CLL settings justifies the potential of ICM in allying with state-of-the-art CLL algorithms, achieving significant accuracy increases of 30% and 10% on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: The advancement of diffusion models has enhanced the realism of AI-generated content but also raised concerns about misuse, necessitating robust copyright protection and tampering localization. Although recent methods have made progress toward unified solutions, their reliance on post hoc processing introduces considerable application inconvenience and compromises forensic reliability. We propose StableGuard, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates a binary watermark into the diffusion generation process, ensuring copyright protection and tampering localization in Latent Diffusion Models through an end-to-end design. We develop a Multiplexing Watermark VAE (MPW-VAE) by equipping a pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a lightweight latent residual-based adapter, enabling the generation of paired watermarked and watermark-free images. These pairs, fused via random masks, create a diverse dataset for training a tampering-agnostic forensic network. To further enhance forensic synergy, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts Guided Forensic Network (MoE-GFN) that dynamically integrates holistic watermark patterns, local tampering traces, and frequency-domain cues for precise watermark verification and tampered region detection. The MPW-VAE and MoE-GFN are jointly optimized in a self-supervised, end-to-end manner, fostering a reciprocal training between watermark embedding and forensic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StableGuard consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image fidelity, watermark verification, and tampering localization.

- **Summary**: Recent work has shown promising performance of frontier large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts in medical quizzes and diagnostic tasks, highlighting their potential for broad clinical utility given their accessible, general-purpose nature. However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%), all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark (80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the lowest performance on all pathologies, showing limited capacity to generalize to this novel task. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating them with task-specific tools for reliable use.

- **Summary**: The ability to centrally control network infrastructure using a programmable middleware has made Software-Defined Networking (SDN) ideal for emerging applications, such as immersive environments. However, such flexibility introduces new vulnerabilities, such as switch misreporting led load imbalance, which in turn make such immersive environment vulnerable to severe quality degradation. In this paper, we present a hybrid machine learning (ML)-based network anomaly detection framework that identifies such stealthy misreporting by capturing temporal inconsistencies in switch-reported loads, and thereby counter potentially catastrophic quality degradation of hosted immersive application. The detection system combines unsupervised anomaly scoring with supervised classification to robustly distinguish malicious behavior. Data collected from a realistic testbed deployment under both benign and adversarial conditions is used to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results show that the framework achieves high recall in detecting misreporting behavior, making it effective for early and reliable detection in SDN environments.

- **Summary**: Long-Form Video Question Answering (LVQA) poses challenges beyond traditional visual question answering (VQA), which is often limited to static images or short video clips. While current vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in those settings, they struggle with complex queries in LVQA over long videos involving multi-step temporal reasoning and causality. Vanilla approaches, which sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM with the question, incur significant token overhead, forcing severe downsampling. As a result, the model often misses fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, or key temporal cues, ultimately leading to incorrect answers. To address these limitations, recent works have explored query-adaptive frame sampling, hierarchical keyframe selection, and agent-based iterative querying. However, these methods remain fundamentally heuristic: they lack explicit temporal representations and cannot enforce or verify logical event relationships. As a result, there are no formal guarantees that the sampled context actually encodes the compositional or causal logic demanded by the question. To address these foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play neuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA translates a natural language question into a formal temporal logic expression, constructs a video automaton from frame-level semantic propositions, and applies model checking to rigorously identify video segments satisfying the question's logical requirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus improving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional reasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on LongVideoBench and CinePile show NeuS-QA improves performance by over 10%, especially on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step compositional reasoning.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces TempSamp-R1, a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework designed to improve the effectiveness of adapting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to video temporal grounding tasks. We reveal that existing reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance, effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation. By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1 optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions (R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%). Moreover, TempSamp-R1 shows robust few-shot generalization capabilities under limited data. Code: https://github.com/HVision-NKU/TempSamp-R1

- **Summary**: Despite Bengali being the sixth most spoken language in the world, handwritten text recognition (HTR) systems for Bengali remain severely underdeveloped. The complexity of Bengali script--featuring conjuncts, diacritics, and highly variable handwriting styles--combined with a scarcity of annotated datasets makes this task particularly challenging. We present GraDeT-HTR, a resource-efficient Bengali handwritten text recognition system based on a Grapheme-aware Decoder-only Transformer architecture. To address the unique challenges of Bengali script, we augment the performance of a decoder-only transformer by integrating a grapheme-based tokenizer and demonstrate that it significantly improves recognition accuracy compared to conventional subword tokenizers. Our model is pretrained on large-scale synthetic data and fine-tuned on real human-annotated samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing accurate surfaces with radiance fields has achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, prevailing approaches, primarily based on Gaussian Splatting, are increasingly constrained by representational bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce GeoSVR, an explicit voxel-based framework that explores and extends the under-investigated potential of sparse voxels for achieving accurate, detailed, and complete surface reconstruction. As strengths, sparse voxels support preserving the coverage completeness and geometric clarity, while corresponding challenges also arise from absent scene constraints and locality in surface refinement. To ensure correct scene convergence, we first propose a Voxel-Uncertainty Depth Constraint that maximizes the effect of monocular depth cues while presenting a voxel-oriented uncertainty to avoid quality degradation, enabling effective and robust scene constraints yet preserving highly accurate geometries. Subsequently, Sparse Voxel Surface Regularization is designed to enhance geometric consistency for tiny voxels and facilitate the voxel-based formation of sharp and accurate surfaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance compared to existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios, excelling in geometric accuracy, detail preservation, and reconstruction completeness while maintaining high efficiency.

- **Summary**: Generating high-fidelity images of humans with fine-grained control over attributes such as hairstyle and clothing remains a core challenge in personalized text-to-image synthesis. While prior methods emphasize identity preservation from a reference image, they lack modularity and fail to provide disentangled control over specific visual attributes. We introduce a new paradigm for attribute-specific image prompting, in which distinct sets of reference images are used to guide the generation of individual aspects of human appearance, such as hair, clothing, and identity. Our method encodes these inputs into attribute-specific tokens, which are injected into a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. This enables compositional and disentangled control over multiple visual factors, even across multiple people within a single image. To promote natural composition and robust disentanglement, we curate a cross-reference training dataset featuring subjects in diverse poses and expressions, and propose a multi-attribute cross-reference training strategy that encourages the model to generate faithful outputs from misaligned attribute inputs while adhering to both identity and textual conditioning. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurately following both visual and textual prompts. Our framework paves the way for more configurable human image synthesis by combining visual prompting with text-driven generation.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their remarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular focuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also designed to verify the flexibility of our method.

- **Summary**: Universal multimodal embedding models have achieved great success in capturing semantic relevance between queries and candidates. However, current methods either condense queries and candidates into a single vector, potentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or produce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector retrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal retrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and interacted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta Tokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer contextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector embeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training, MetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple vectors. As a result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval, where users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by selecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions. Extensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to models with 32B parameters.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at translating language prompts into photorealistic images by implicitly grounding textual concepts through their cross-modal attention mechanisms. Recent multi-modal diffusion transformers extend this by introducing joint self-attention over concatenated image and text tokens, enabling richer and more scalable cross-modal alignment. However, a detailed understanding of how and where these attention maps contribute to image generation remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Seg4Diff (Segmentation for Diffusion), a systematic framework for analyzing the attention structures of MM-DiT, with a focus on how specific layers propagate semantic information from text to image. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify a semantic grounding expert layer, a specific MM-DiT block that consistently aligns text tokens with spatially coherent image regions, naturally producing high-quality semantic segmentation masks. We further demonstrate that applying a lightweight fine-tuning scheme with mask-annotated image data enhances the semantic grouping capabilities of these layers and thereby improves both segmentation performance and generated image fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that semantic grouping is an emergent property of diffusion transformers and can be selectively amplified to advance both segmentation and generation performance, paving the way for unified models that bridge visual perception and generation.

- **Journal**: Computer Graphics Forum, Volume 44, 2025
- **Summary**: Dynamic surface reconstruction of objects from point cloud sequences is a challenging field in computer graphics. Existing approaches either require multiple regularization terms or extensive training data which, however, lead to compromises in reconstruction accuracy as well as over-smoothing or poor generalization to unseen objects and motions. To address these lim- itations, we introduce Preconditioned Deformation Grids, a novel technique for estimating coherent deformation fields directly from unstructured point cloud sequences without requiring or forming explicit correspondences. Key to our approach is the use of multi-resolution voxel grids that capture the overall motion at varying spatial scales, enabling a more flexible deformation representation. In conjunction with incorporating grid-based Sobolev preconditioning into gradient-based optimization, we show that applying a Chamfer loss between the input point clouds as well as to an evolving template mesh is sufficient to obtain accurate deformations. To ensure temporal consistency along the object surface, we include a weak isometry loss on mesh edges which complements the main objective without constraining deformation fidelity. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior results, particularly for long sequences, compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

- **Summary**: As medical diagnoses increasingly leverage multimodal data, machine learning models are expected to effectively fuse heterogeneous information while remaining robust to missing modalities. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal learning framework that integrates enhanced modalities dropout and contrastive learning to address real-world limitations such as modality imbalance and missingness. Our approach introduces learnable modality tokens for improving missingness-aware fusion of modalities and augments conventional unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations. We validate our framework on large-scale clinical datasets for disease detection and prediction tasks, encompassing both visual and tabular modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in challenging and practical scenarios where only a single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with significant potential for real-world clinical applications.

- **Summary**: In this study, we curated a densely annotated in-house dataset comprising 490 CTPA scans. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT) families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further validated on public datasets.

- **Summary**: Handshapes serve a fundamental phonological role in signed languages, with American Sign Language employing approximately 50 distinct shapes. However,computational approaches rarely model handshapes explicitly, limiting both recognition accuracy and linguistic analysis.We introduce a novel graph neural network that separates temporal dynamics from static handshape configurations. Our approach combines anatomically-informed graph structures with contrastive learning to address key challenges in handshape recognition, including subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. We establish the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences, achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes (with baseline methods achieving 25%).

- **Summary**: Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for safe deployment of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound amidst heterogeneous image characteristics and clinical settings. OOD detection relies on estimating a classification model's uncertainty, which should increase for OOD samples. While existing research has largely focused on uncertainty quantification methods, this work investigates the impact of the classification task itself. Through experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four classification tasks, we demonstrate that OOD detection performance significantly varies with the task, and that the best task depends on the defined ID-OOD criteria; specifically, whether the OOD sample is due to: i) an image characteristic shift or ii) an anatomical feature shift. Furthermore, we reveal that superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained prediction, underscoring the necessity to align task selection and uncertainty strategies with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: Accurate localisation is critical for mobile robots in structured outdoor environments, yet LiDAR-based methods often fail in vineyards due to repetitive row geometry and perceptual aliasing. We propose a semantic particle filter that incorporates stable object-level detections, specifically vine trunks and support poles into the likelihood estimation process. Detected landmarks are projected into a birds eye view and fused with LiDAR scans to generate semantic observations. A key innovation is the use of semantic walls, which connect adjacent landmarks into pseudo-structural constraints that mitigate row aliasing. To maintain global consistency in headland regions where semantics are sparse, we introduce a noisy GPS prior that adaptively supports the filter. Experiments in a real vineyard demonstrate that our approach maintains localisation within the correct row, recovers from deviations where AMCL fails, and outperforms vision-based SLAM methods such as RTAB-Map.

- **Summary**: Accurate visual localization from aerial views is a fundamental problem with applications in mapping, large-area inspection, and search-and-rescue operations. In many scenarios, these systems require high-precision localization while operating with limited resources (e.g., no internet connection or GNSS/GPS support), making large image databases or heavy 3D models impractical. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to leveraging orthographic geodata as an alternative paradigm, which is lightweight and increasingly available through free releases by governmental authorities (e.g., the European Union). To fill this gap, we propose OrthoLoC, the first large-scale dataset comprising 16,425 UAV images from Germany and the United States with multiple modalities. The dataset addresses domain shifts between UAV imagery and geospatial data. Its paired structure enables fair benchmarking of existing solutions by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching, allowing isolated evaluation of localization and calibration performance. Through comprehensive evaluation, we examine the impact of domain shifts, data resolutions, and covisibility on localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce a refinement technique called AdHoP, which can be integrated with any feature matcher, improving matching by up to 95% and reducing translation error by up to 63%. The dataset and code are available at: https://deepscenario.github.io/OrthoLoC.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior (DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns, and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking, patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references, and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves 0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet

- **Summary**: Grounding vision--language models in low-resource languages remains challenging, as they often produce fluent text about the wrong objects. This stems from scarce paired data, translation pivots that break alignment, and English-centric pretraining that ignores target-language semantics. We address this with a compute-aware Bengali captioning pipeline trained on LaBSE-verified EN--BN pairs and 110k bilingual-prompted synthetic images. A frozen MaxViT yields stable visual patches, a Bengali-native mBART-50 decodes, and a lightweight bridge links the modalities. Our core novelty is a tri-loss objective: Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) aligns real and synthetic patch descriptors using decoder cross-attention, InfoNCE enforces global real--synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based OT ensures balanced fine-grained patch correspondence. This PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy improves grounding, reduces spurious matches, and drives strong gains on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR 27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14, BERTScore-F1 75.40), outperforming strong CE baselines and narrowing the real--synthetic centroid gap by 41%.

- **Summary**: We present TinyBEV, a unified, camera only Bird's Eye View (BEV) framework that distills the full-stack capabilities of a large planning-oriented teacher (UniAD [19]) into a compact, real-time student model. Unlike prior efficient camera only baselines such as VAD[23] and VADv2[7], TinyBEV supports the complete autonomy stack 3D detection, HD-map segmentation, motion forecasting, occupancy prediction, and goal-directed planning within a streamlined 28M-parameter backbone, achieving a 78% reduction in parameters over UniAD [19]. Our model-agnostic, multi-stage distillation strategy combines feature-level, output-level, and adaptive region-aware supervision to effectively transfer high-capacity multi-modal knowledge to a lightweight BEV representation. On nuScenes[4], Tiny-BEV achieves 39.0 mAP for detection, 1.08 minADE for motion forecasting, and a 0.32 collision rate, while running 5x faster (11 FPS) and requiring only camera input. These results demonstrate that full-stack driving intelligence can be retained in resource-constrained settings, bridging the gap between large-scale, multi-modal perception-planning models and deployment-ready real-time autonomy.

- **Summary**: Accurate dose calculation on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is essential for modern proton treatment planning workflows, particularly when accounting for inter-fractional anatomical changes in adaptive treatment scenarios. Traditional CBCT-based dose calculation suffers from image quality limitations, requiring complex correction workflows. This study develops and validates a deep learning approach for direct proton dose calculation from CBCT images using extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) neural networks. A retrospective dataset of 40 head-and-neck cancer patients with paired planning CT and treatment CBCT images was used to train an xLSTM-based neural network (CBCT-NN). The architecture incorporates energy token encoding and beam's-eye-view sequence modelling to capture spatial dependencies in proton dose deposition patterns. Training utilized 82,500 paired beam configurations with Monte Carlo-generated ground truth doses. Validation was performed on 5 independent patients using gamma analysis, mean percentage dose error assessment, and dose-volume histogram comparison. The CBCT-NN achieved gamma pass rates of 95.1 $\pm$ 2.7% using 2mm/2% criteria. Mean percentage dose errors were 2.6 $\pm$ 1.4% in high-dose regions ($>$90% of max dose) and 5.9 $\pm$ 1.9% globally. Dose-volume histogram analysis showed excellent preservation of target coverage metrics (Clinical Target Volume V95% difference: -0.6 $\pm$ 1.1%) and organ-at-risk constraints (parotid mean dose difference: -0.5 $\pm$ 1.5%). Computation time is under 3 minutes without sacrificing Monte Carlo-level accuracy. This study demonstrates the proof-of-principle of direct CBCT-based proton dose calculation using xLSTM neural networks. The approach eliminates traditional correction workflows while achieving comparable accuracy and computational efficiency suitable for adaptive protocols.

- **Summary**: Motion blur reduces the clarity of fast-moving objects, posing challenges for detection systems, especially in racket sports, where balls often appear as streaks rather than distinct points. Existing labeling conventions mark the ball at the leading edge of the blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring valuable motion cues correlated with velocity. This paper introduces a new labeling strategy that places the ball at the center of the blur streak and explicitly annotates blur attributes. Using this convention, we release a new table tennis ball detection dataset. We demonstrate that this labeling approach consistently enhances detection performance across various models. Furthermore, we introduce BlurBall, a model that jointly estimates ball position and motion blur attributes. By incorporating attention mechanisms such as Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, we achieve state-of-the-art results in ball detection. Leveraging blur not only improves detection accuracy but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction, benefiting real-time sports analytics.

- **Summary**: Running a large open-vocabulary (Open-vocab) detector on every video frame is accurate but expensive. We introduce a training-free pipeline that invokes OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors (MV). A simple 3x3 grid aggregation of motion vectors provides translation and uniform-scale updates, augmented with an area-growth check and an optional single-class switch. The method requires no labels, no fine-tuning, and uses the same prompt list for all open-vocabulary methods. On ILSVRC2015-VID (validation dataset), our approach (MVP) attains mAP@0.5=0.609 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds it remains close to framewise OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 at 0.2/0.3 versus 0.784/0.780), reflecting that coarse localization is largely preserved. Under the same keyframe schedule, MVP outperforms tracker-based propagation (MOSSE, KCF, CSRT) at mAP@0.5. A supervised reference (YOLOv12x) reaches 0.631 at mAP@0.5 but requires labeled training, whereas our method remains label-free and open-vocabulary. These results indicate that compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to reduce detector invocations while keeping strong zero-shot coverage in videos.

- **Summary**: Advances in high dynamic range (HDR) lighting estimation from a single image have opened new possibilities for augmented reality (AR) applications. Predicting complex lighting environments from a single input image allows for the realistic rendering and compositing of virtual objects. In this work, we investigate the color robustness of such methods -- an often overlooked yet critical factor for achieving visual realism. While most evaluations conflate color with other lighting attributes (e.g., intensity, direction), we isolate color as the primary variable of interest. Rather than introducing a new lighting estimation algorithm, we explore whether simple adaptation techniques can enhance the color accuracy of existing models. Using a novel HDR dataset featuring diverse lighting colors, we systematically evaluate several adaptation strategies. Our results show that preprocessing the input image with a pre-trained white balance network improves color robustness, outperforming other strategies across all tested scenarios. Notably, this approach requires no retraining of the lighting estimation model. We further validate the generality of this finding by applying the technique to three state-of-the-art lighting estimation methods from recent literature.

- **Summary**: Visual assistive technologies, such as Microsoft Seeing AI, can improve access to environmental information for persons with blindness or low vision (pBLV). Yet, the physical and functional implications of different device embodiments remain unclear. In this study, 11 pBLV participants used Seeing AI on a hand-held smartphone and on a head-mounted ARx Vision system to perform six activities of daily living, while their movements were captured with Xsens motion capture. Functional outcomes included task time, success rate, and number of attempts, and biomechanical measures included joint range of motion, angular path length, working volume, and movement smoothness. The head-mounted system generally reduced upper-body movement and task time, especially for document-scanning style tasks, whereas the hand-held system yielded higher success rates for tasks involving small or curved text. These findings indicate that both embodiments are viable, but they differ in terms of physical demands and ease of use. Incorporating biomechanical measures into assistive technology evaluations can inform designs that optimise user experience by balancing functional efficiency, physical sustainability, and intuitive interaction.

- **Summary**: Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem, facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However, their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud, underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets, a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object detection models tailored to institutional needs.

- **Summary**: Vision language models (VLMs) show strong results on chart understanding, yet existing benchmarks assume clean figures and fact based queries. Real world charts often contain distortions and demand reasoning beyond simple matching. We evaluate ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, finding sharp performance drops under corruption or occlusion, with hallucinations such as value fabrication, trend misinterpretation, and entity confusion becoming more frequent. Models remain overconfident in degraded settings, generating plausible but unsupported explanations.   To address this gap, we introduce CHART NOISe(Chart Hallucinations, Answers, and Reasoning Testing on Noisy and Occluded Input Selections), a dataset combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and exam style multiple choice questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. A key innovation is prompt reverse inconsistency, where models contradict themselves when asked to confirm versus deny the same statement. Our contributions are threefold: (1) benchmarking state of the art VLMs, exposing systematic vulnerabilities in chart reasoning; (2) releasing CHART NOISe, the first dataset unifying corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency; and (3) proposing baseline mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection. Together, these efforts establish a rigorous testbed for advancing robustness and reliability in chart understanding.

- **Summary**: Four-dimensional MRI (4D-MRI) is an promising technique for capturing respiratory-induced motion in radiation therapy planning and delivery. Conventional 4D reconstruction methods, which typically rely on phase binning or separate template scans, struggle to capture temporal variability, complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. We introduce a neural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth, continuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing the conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion modeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical representation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by Transformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent deformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers demonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both regular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method significantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from approximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to just 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D volume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at any respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional methods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have gained popularity for learning robotic manipulation tasks that follow language instructions. State-of-the-art VLAs, such as OpenVLA and $\pi_{0}$, were trained on large-scale, manually labeled action datasets collected through teleoperation. More recent approaches, including LAPA and villa-X, introduce latent action representations that enable unsupervised pretraining on unlabeled datasets by modeling abstract visual changes between frames. Although these methods have shown strong results, their large model sizes make deployment in real-world settings challenging. In this work, we propose LAWM, a model-agnostic framework to pretrain imitation learning models in a self-supervised way, by learning latent action representations from unlabeled video data through world modeling. These videos can be sourced from robot recordings or videos of humans performing actions with everyday objects. Our framework is designed to be effective for transferring across tasks, environments, and embodiments. It outperforms models trained with ground-truth robotics actions and similar pretraining methods on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world setup, while being significantly more efficient and practical for real-world settings.

- **Summary**: Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors: inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms. However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values: 31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs. Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving tiny object tracking applications.

- **Summary**: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements, zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection, multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against the rising tide of deepfake attacks.
