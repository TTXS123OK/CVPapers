- **Summary**: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE) module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

- **Summary**: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images. While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over 2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which contributes to faster convergence.

- **Summary**: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness, and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging, where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However, existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly, lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be released.

- **Summary**: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on fine-grained datasets.



### EGTM: Event-guided Efficient Turbulence Mitigation

- **Summary**: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental \textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then, build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214 times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality (+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released once accepted.

- **Summary**: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable, human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction, color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions: tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

- **Summary**: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However, limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model architectures and datasets.



### Focus Through Motion: RGB-Event Collaborative Token Sparsification for Efficient Object Detection

- **Summary**: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data) uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However, CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer, which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL.

- **Summary**: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the comprehensive applications of digital humans. A complete list of the models examined in this survey is available in Our Repository https://github.com/Winn1y/Awesome-Human-Motion-Video-Generation.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models. Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency}, \textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a \textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

- **Summary**: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However, current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG, a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving 10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task. The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples, and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model. Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling across CLIP backbones.

- **Summary**: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity (RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments, but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.   We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SPECS.

- **Summary**: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable medical AI systems.

- **Summary**: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive 3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding (LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research in this field.

- **Summary**: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies. Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness. Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii) first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy.

- **Summary**: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support radiologists.

- **Summary**: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot, enabling high scalability.

- **Summary**: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD), most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation, change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal RSCD.

- **Summary**: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few annotations are available for training, since the feature representation benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert annotations even if it is only available during training.

- **Summary**: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models. This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types, spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks: MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust and fair model evaluation.

- **Summary**: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc framework.

- **Summary**: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task, models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations, where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications, including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of each module.

- **Summary**: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over 98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

- **Summary**: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach, approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters, but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations. Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous scattering in a feed-forward manner.

- **Summary**: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets: MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to other re-ranking methods.

- **Summary**: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics, especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control, limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than ``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i) human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion. Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized motion generation.

- **Summary**: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and (ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

- **Summary**: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of 85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing performance, computational efficiency, and scalability, TriLiteNet offers a practical and deployable solution for real-world autonomous driving applications.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation. However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs, effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning challenges in federated settings.

- **Summary**: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2) real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool, preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0 event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing. Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

- **Summary**: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue rendering.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and (2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas. During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g., realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models with the same backbone in both image quality   and style diversity.

- **Summary**: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars. However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand, generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time, controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale, cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

- **Summary**: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability, focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in real-world settings.

- **Summary**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers, and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model, using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal defects.

- **Summary**: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction. Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation. Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO, COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations. Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image, often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets over 13 domains. The code will be released.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically, our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile (DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology, into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input, which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and Recall.

- **Summary**: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography (PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis, leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217 measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive conditions.

- **Summary**: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance for feature extraction and important prior information from   datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint, ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset show the superiority of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100 under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise conditions.

- **Summary**: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15 objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic alignment with natural hand motion.

- **Summary**: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline, providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning tasks.

- **Summary**: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations. First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records. Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

- **Summary**: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.   Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.   Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks. Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.   Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

- **Summary**: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions. To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and generalization.

- **Summary**: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local, stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost. Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

- **Summary**: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

- **Summary**: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search, this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g., falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1 accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code and models will be released for future research.

- **Summary**: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities. However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC. Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto 3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image. Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First, we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints. Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree environments.

- **Summary**: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost, while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators, TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

- **Summary**: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable, physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems, making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally, we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

- **Summary**: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex 3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective: distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD), to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD) further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s (2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

- **Summary**: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations, despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training.

- **Summary**: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest (ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

- **Summary**: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding (image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss; (ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii) Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of their shared representations.

- **Summary**: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision + tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers, providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation, increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot dexterity.

Despite their unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity, making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity. Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300 research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of panoramic vision technologies.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story visualizations at various levels of detail.

- **Summary**: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also offering strong generalization and interpretability.

- **Summary**: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process, eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data, while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments. To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions, making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.
