- **Summary**: Prior studies in learned image compression (LIC) consistently show that only a small subset of latent channels is critical for reconstruction, while many others carry limited information. Exploiting this imbalance could improve both coding and computational efficiency, yet existing approaches often rely on costly, dataset-specific ablation tests and typically analyze channels in isolation, ignoring their interdependencies.   We propose a generalizable, dataset-agnostic method to identify and organize important channels in pretrained VAE-based LIC models. Instead of brute-force empirical evaluations, our approach leverages intrinsic parameter statistics-weight variances, bias magnitudes, and pairwise correlations-to estimate channel importance. This analysis reveals a consistent organizational structure, termed the Invariant Salient Channel Space (ISCS), where Salient-Core channels capture dominant structures and Salient-Auxiliary channels provide complementary details. Building on ISCS, we introduce a deterministic channel ordering and grouping strategy that enables slice-parallel decoding, reduces redundancy, and improves bitrate efficiency.   Experiments across multiple LIC architectures demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bitrate and computation while maintaining reconstruction quality, providing a practical and modular enhancement to existing learned compression frameworks.

- **Summary**: We introduce ConfidentSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based SLAM system for robust, highfidelity RGB-only reconstruction. Addressing geometric inaccuracies in existing RGB-only 3DGS SLAM methods that stem from unreliable depth estimation, ConfidentSplat incorporates a core innovation: a confidence-weighted fusion mechanism. This mechanism adaptively integrates depth cues from multiview geometry with learned monocular priors (Omnidata ViT), dynamically weighting their contributions based on explicit reliability estimates-derived predominantly from multi-view geometric consistency-to generate high-fidelity proxy depth for map supervision. The resulting proxy depth guides the optimization of a deformable 3DGS map, which efficiently adapts online to maintain global consistency following pose updates from a DROID-SLAM-inspired frontend and backend optimizations (loop closure, global bundle adjustment). Extensive validation on standard benchmarks (TUM-RGBD, ScanNet) and diverse custom mobile datasets demonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy (L1 depth error) and novel view synthesis fidelity (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) over baselines, particularly in challenging conditions. ConfidentSplat underscores the efficacy of principled, confidence-aware sensor fusion for advancing state-of-the-art dense visual SLAM.

- **Summary**: Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) image translation is a fundamental task in many computational vision problems. Numerous data-driven methods have been proposed to address this problem; however, they lack explicit modeling of illumination, lighting, and scene geometry in images. This limits the quality of the reconstructed HDR images. Since lighting and shadows interact differently with different materials, (e.g., specular surfaces such as glass and metal, and lambertian or diffuse surfaces such as wood and stone), modeling material-specific properties (e.g., specular and diffuse reflectance) has the potential to improve the quality of HDR image reconstruction. This paper presents PhysHDR, a simple yet powerful latent diffusion-based generative model for HDR image reconstruction. The denoising process is conditioned on lighting and depth information and guided by a novel loss to incorporate material properties of surfaces in the scene. The experimental results establish the efficacy of PhysHDR in comparison to a number of recent state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The gaming and entertainment industry is rapidly evolving, driven by immersive experiences and the integration of generative AI (GAI) technologies. Training such models effectively requires large-scale datasets that capture the diversity and context of gaming environments. However, existing datasets are often limited to specific domains or rely on artificial degradations, which do not accurately capture the unique characteristics of gaming content. Moreover, benchmarks for controllable video generation remain absent.   To address these limitations, we introduce $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$, a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-view dataset specifically designed to overcome the shortcomings of current resources. Unlike existing datasets, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides diverse, high-fidelity gaming content rendered with Unreal Engine 5, offering authentic ground-truth LR-HR paired and multi-view frames across 80 scenes in 8 categories. It includes $\mathtt{M^3VIR\_MR}$ for super-resolution (SR), novel view synthesis (NVS), and combined NVS+SR tasks, and $\mathtt{M^3VIR\_{MS}}$, the first multi-style, object-level ground-truth set enabling research on controlled video generation. Additionally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art SR and NVS methods to establish performance baselines. While no existing approaches directly handle controlled video generation, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides a benchmark for advancing this area. By releasing the dataset, we aim to facilitate research in AI-powered restoration, compression, and controllable content generation for next-generation cloud gaming and entertainment.

- **Summary**: Attention mechanisms in Transformers have gained significant empirical success. Nonetheless, the optimization objectives underlying their forward pass are still unclear. Additionally, the quadratic complexity of self-attention is increasingly prohibitive. Unlike the prior work on addressing the interpretability or efficiency issue separately, we propose a unified optimization objective to alleviate both issues simultaneously. By unrolling the optimization over the objective, we derive an inherently interpretable and efficient attention mechanism, which compresses all tokens into low-dimensional structures by contracting a few representative tokens and then broadcasting the contractions back. This Contract-and-Broadcast Self-Attention (CBSA) mechanism can not only scale linearly but also generalize existing attention mechanisms as its special cases. Experiments further demonstrate comparable performance and even superior advantages of CBSA on several visual tasks. Code is available at this https URL.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot segmentation ability on natural images but encounters difficulties in medical imaging due to domain shifts, anatomical variability, and its reliance on user-provided prompts. Recent prompt-free adaptations alleviate the need for expert intervention, yet still suffer from limited robustness and adaptability, often overlooking the issues of semantic over-smoothing and token uniformity. We propose SAM-DCE, which balances local discrimination and global semantics while mitigating token uniformity, enhancing inter-class separability, and enriching mask decoding with fine-grained, consistent representations. Extensive experiments on diverse medical benchmarks validate its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: As an essential vision task, infrared small target detection (IRSTD) has seen significant advancements through deep learning. However, critical limitations in current evaluation protocols impede further progress. First, existing methods rely on fragmented pixel- and target-level specific metrics, which fails to provide a comprehensive view of model capabilities. Second, an excessive emphasis on overall performance scores obscures crucial error analysis, which is vital for identifying failure modes and improving real-world system performance. Third, the field predominantly adopts dataset-specific training-testing paradigms, hindering the understanding of model robustness and generalization across diverse infrared scenarios. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a hybrid-level metric incorporating pixel- and target-level performance, proposing a systematic error analysis method, and emphasizing the importance of cross-dataset evaluation. These aim to offer a more thorough and rational hierarchical analysis framework, ultimately fostering the development of more effective and robust IRSTD models. An open-source toolkit has be released to facilitate standardized benchmarking.

- **Summary**: Spatial transcriptomics aims to connect high-resolution histology images with spatially resolved gene expression. To achieve better performance on downstream tasks such as gene expression prediction, large-scale pre-training is required to obtain generalisable representations that can bridge histology and transcriptomics across tissues, protocols, and laboratories. Existing cross-modal pre-training approaches for spatial transcriptomics rely on either gene names or expression values in isolation, which strips the gene branch of essential semantics and breaks the association between each gene and its quantitative magnitude. In addition, by restricting supervision to image-text alignment, these methods ignore intrinsic visual cues that are critical for learning robust image features. We present CoMTIP, the first Contrastive Masked Text-Image Pretraining framework that jointly learns from images, gene names, and expression values while capturing fine-grained visual context for spatial transcriptomics. The vision branch uses Masked Feature Modeling to reconstruct occluded patches and learn context-aware image embeddings. The text branch applies a scalable Gene-Text Encoder that processes all gene sentences in parallel, enriches each gene and its numerical value with dedicated embeddings, and employs Pair-aware Adversarial Training (PAAT) to preserve correct gene-value associations. Image and text representations are aligned in a shared InfoNCE-optimised space. Experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that CoMTIP not only surpasses previous methods on diverse downstream tasks but also achieves zero-shot gene expression prediction, a capability that existing approaches do not provide.

- **Summary**: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to a student without access to the real in-distribution (ID) data. While existing methods perform well on small-scale images, they suffer from mode collapse when synthesizing large-scale images, resulting in limited knowledge transfer. Recently, leveraging advanced generative models to synthesize photorealistic images has emerged as a promising alternative. Nevertheless, directly using off-the-shelf diffusion to generate datasets faces the precision-recall challenges: 1) ensuring synthetic data aligns with the real distribution, and 2) ensuring coverage of the real ID manifold. In response, we propose PRISM, a precision-recall informed synthesis method. Specifically, we introduce Energy-guided Distribution Alignment to avoid the generation of out-of-distribution samples, and design the Diversified Prompt Engineering to enhance coverage of the real ID manifold. Extensive experiments on various large-scale image datasets demonstrate the superiority of PRISM. Moreover, we demonstrate that models trained with PRISM exhibit strong domain generalization.

- **Summary**: Survival analysis using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer research. Despite significant successes, pathology images typically only provide slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative representations from gigapixel WSIs. With the rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, multimodal survival analysis integrating pathology images and genomics data has emerged as a promising approach. We propose a Multi-Expert Mamba (ME-Mamba) system that captures discriminative pathological and genomic features while enabling efficient integration of both modalities. This approach achieves complementary information fusion without losing critical information from individual modalities, thereby facilitating accurate cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first introduce a Pathology Expert and a Genomics Expert to process unimodal data separately. Both experts are designed with Mamba architectures that incorporate conventional scanning and attention-based scanning mechanisms, allowing them to extract discriminative features from long instance sequences containing substantial redundant or irrelevant information. Second, we design a Synergistic Expert responsible for modality fusion. It explicitly learns token-level local correspondences between the two modalities via Optimal Transport, and implicitly enhances distribution consistency through a global cross-modal fusion loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The fused feature representations are then passed to a mamba backbone for further integration. Through the collaboration of the Pathology Expert, Genomics Expert, and Synergistic Expert, our method achieves stable and accurate survival analysis with relatively low computational complexity. Extensive experimental results on five datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present SLAM-Former, a novel neural approach that integrates full SLAM capabilities into a single transformer. Similar to traditional SLAM systems, SLAM-Former comprises both a frontend and a backend that operate in tandem. The frontend processes sequential monocular images in real-time for incremental mapping and tracking, while the backend performs global refinement to ensure a geometrically consistent result. This alternating execution allows the frontend and backend to mutually promote one another, enhancing overall system performance. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that SLAM-Former achieves superior or highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art dense SLAM methods.

- **Summary**: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are rare abnormal cell divisions associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Their detection remains a significant challenge due to subtle morphological cues, class imbalance, and inter-observer variability among pathologists. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduced a dedicated track for atypical mitosis classification, enabling systematic evaluation of deep learning methods. In this study, we investigated the use of large vision foundation models, including Virchow, Virchow2, and UNI, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We conducted extensive experiments with different LoRA ranks, as well as random and group-based data splits, to analyze robustness under varied conditions. Our best approach, Virchow with LoRA rank 8 and ensemble of three-fold cross-validation, achieved a balanced accuracy of 88.37% on the preliminary test set, ranking joint 9th in the challenge leaderboard. These results highlight the promise of foundation models with efficient adaptation strategies for the classification of atypical mitosis, while underscoring the need for improvements in specificity and domain generalization.

- **Summary**: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) enables domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of Remote Sensing Images (RSIs) using only a well-trained source model and unlabeled target domain data. However, the lack of ground-truth labels in the target domain often leads to the generation of noisy pseudo-labels. Such noise impedes the effective mitigation of domain shift (DS). To address this challenge, we propose ProSFDA, a prototype-guided SFDA framework. It employs prototype-weighted pseudo-labels to facilitate reliable self-training (ST) under pseudo-labels noise. We, in addition, introduce a prototype-contrast strategy that encourages the aggregation of features belonging to the same class, enabling the model to learn discriminative target domain representations without relying on ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods.



### Catching the Details: Self-Distilled RoI Predictors for Fine-Grained MLLM Perception

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require high-resolution visual information to perform fine-grained perception, yet processing entire high-resolution images is computationally prohibitive. While recent methods leverage a Region-of-Interest (RoI) mechanism to focus on salient areas, they typically present a difficult trade-off: training-based approaches depend on large-scale annotated datasets, while training-free methods that utilize the model's internal attention are computationally inefficient and less accurate, requiring either multi-pass prefill stages or reliance on the slow auto-regressive decoding process. In this paper, we propose an efficient, annotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves this trade-off. The SD-RPN is built around a pipeline that transforms the noisy attention maps from the MLLM's middle layers into high-quality pseudo-RoI labels by explicitly denoising the signal and resolving ambiguity. We use these labels to train a lightweight Region Proposal Network (RPN) that learns a more precise localization. This RPN is also highly efficient, predicting the RoI in a single forward pass using features from the MLLM's middle layers, decoupling RoI identification from the auto-regressive generation and avoiding costly multi-pass operations.To validate our approach, we integrate the framework into the LLaVA-1.5 architecture. Despite being trained on only a few (e.g. 10K) question-answer pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional data efficiency and generalization, achieving over a 10% absolute accuracy improvement on unseen benchmarks, including TextVQA, DocVQA, and V-Star. Our work presents a practical and scalable solution for enhancing the fine-grained perception of MLLMs without requiring costly supervision or full model fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: This paper presents RPEP, the first pre-training method for event-based 3D hand pose estimation using labeled RGB images and unpaired, unlabeled event data. Event data offer significant benefits such as high temporal resolution and low latency, but their application to hand pose estimation is still limited by the scarcity of labeled training data. To address this, we repurpose real RGB datasets to train event-based estimators. This is done by constructing pseudo-event-RGB pairs, where event data is generated and aligned with the ground-truth poses of RGB images. Unfortunately, existing pseudo-event generation techniques assume stationary objects, thus struggling to handle non-stationary, dynamically moving hands. To overcome this, RPEP introduces a novel generation strategy that decomposes hand movements into smaller, step-by-step motions. This decomposition allows our method to capture temporal changes in articulation, constructing more realistic event data for a moving hand. Additionally, RPEP imposes a motion reversal constraint, regularizing event generation using reversed motion. Extensive experiments show that our pre-trained model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real event data, achieving up to 24% improvement on EvRealHands. Moreover, it delivers strong performance with minimal labeled samples for fine-tuning, making it well-suited for practical deployment.

- **Summary**: Text-to-video generation is an emerging field in generative AI, enabling the creation of realistic, semantically accurate videos from text prompts. While current models achieve impressive visual quality and alignment with input text, they typically rely on static knowledge, making it difficult to incorporate new data without retraining from scratch. To address this limitation, we propose VidCLearn, a continual learning framework for diffusion-based text-to-video generation. VidCLearn features a student-teacher architecture where the student model is incrementally updated with new text-video pairs, and the teacher model helps preserve previously learned knowledge through generative replay. Additionally, we introduce a novel temporal consistency loss to enhance motion smoothness and a video retrieval module to provide structural guidance at inference. Our architecture is also designed to be more computationally efficient than existing models while retaining satisfactory generation performance. Experimental results show VidCLearn's superiority over baseline methods in terms of visual quality, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence.

- **Summary**: Oriented object detection for multi-spectral imagery faces significant challenges due to differences both within and between modalities. Although existing methods have improved detection accuracy through complex network architectures, their high computational complexity and memory consumption severely restrict their performance. Motivated by the success of large kernel convolutions in remote sensing, we propose MO R-CNN, a lightweight framework for multi-spectral oriented detection featuring heterogeneous feature extraction network (HFEN), single modality supervision (SMS), and condition-based multimodal label fusion (CMLF). HFEN leverages inter-modal differences to adaptively align, merge, and enhance multi-modal features. SMS constrains multi-scale features and enables the model to learn from multiple modalities. CMLF fuses multimodal labels based on specific rules, providing the model with a more robust and consistent supervisory signal. Experiments on the DroneVehicle, VEDAI and OGSOD datasets prove the superiority of our method. The source code is available at:https://github.com/Iwill-github/MORCNN.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful technique for text-to-image (T2I) generation, creating high-quality, diverse images across various domains. However, a common limitation in these models is the incomplete display of objects, where fragments or missing parts undermine the model's performance in downstream applications. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the incompleteness issue and reveal that the primary factor behind incomplete object generation is the usage of RandomCrop during model training. This widely used data augmentation method, though enhances model generalization ability, disrupts object continuity during training. To address this, we propose a training-free solution that penalizes activation values at image boundaries during the early denoising steps. Our method is easily applicable to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models with minimal modifications and negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements in object integrity and image quality.

- **Summary**: Sparse annotation in remote sensing object detection poses significant challenges due to dense object distributions and category imbalances. Although existing Dense Pseudo-Label methods have demonstrated substantial potential in pseudo-labeling tasks, they remain constrained by selection ambiguities and inconsistencies in confidence estimation.In this paper, we introduce an LLM-assisted semantic guidance framework tailored for sparsely annotated remote sensing object detection, exploiting the advanced semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to distill high-confidence pseudo-labels.By integrating LLM-generated semantic priors, we propose a Class-Aware Dense Pseudo-Label Assignment mechanism that adaptively assigns pseudo-labels for both unlabeled and sparsely labeled data, ensuring robust supervision across varying data distributions. Additionally, we develop an Adaptive Hard-Negative Reweighting Module to stabilize the supervised learning branch by mitigating the influence of confounding background information. Extensive experiments on DOTA and HRSC2016 demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing single-stage detector-based frameworks, significantly improving detection performance under sparse annotations.

- **Summary**: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting and tracking objects in videos conditioned on natural-language expressions, demanding fine-grained understanding of both appearance and motion. Building on Sa2VA, which couples a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the video segmentation model SAM2, we identify two key bottlenecks that limit segmentation performance: sparse frame sampling and reliance on a single [SEG] token for an entire video. We propose Segmentation Augmented and Selective Averaged Sa2VA SaSaSa2VA to address these issues. On the 7th LSVOS Challenge (RVOS track), SaSaSa2VA achieves a $J\&F$ of 67.45, ranking first and surpassing the runner-up by 2.80 points. This result and ablation studies demonstrate that efficient segmentation augmentation and test-time ensembling substantially enhance grounded MLLMs for RVOS.

- **Summary**: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a task of central importance in the field of document image understanding. State-of-the-art methods for HTR require the use of extensive annotated sets for training, making them impractical for low-resource domains like historical archives or limited-size modern collections. This paper introduces a novel framework that, unlike the standard HTR model paradigm, can leverage mild prior knowledge of lexical characteristics; this is ideal for scenarios where labeled data are scarce. We propose an iterative bootstrapping approach that aligns visual features extracted from unlabeled images with semantic word representations using Optimal Transport (OT). Starting with a minimal set of labeled examples, the framework iteratively matches word images to text labels, generates pseudo-labels for high-confidence alignments, and retrains the recognizer on the growing dataset. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our iterative visual-semantic alignment scheme significantly improves recognition accuracy on low-resource HTR benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Recently, autoregressive image generation models have wowed audiences with their remarkable capability in creating surprisingly realistic images. Models such as GPT-4o and LlamaGen can not only produce images that faithfully mimic renowned artistic styles like Ghibli, Van Gogh, or Picasso, but also potentially generate Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content, raising significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and ethical use. Despite these concerns, methods to safeguard autoregressive text-to-image models remain underexplored. Previous concept erasure methods, primarily designed for diffusion models that operate in denoising latent space, are not directly applicable to autoregressive models that generate images token by token. To address this critical gap, we propose Visual Contrast Exploitation (VCE), a novel framework comprising: (1) an innovative contrastive image pair construction paradigm that precisely decouples unsafe concepts from their associated content semantics, and (2) a sophisticated DPO-based training approach that enhances the model's ability to identify and leverage visual contrastive features from image pairs, enabling precise concept erasure. Our comprehensive experiments across three challenging tasks-artist style erasure, explicit content erasure, and object removal-demonstrate that our method effectively secures the model, achieving state-of-the-art results while erasing unsafe concepts and maintaining the integrity of unrelated safe concepts.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral change detection (HCD) aims to accurately identify land-cover changes in hyperspectral images of the same area acquired at different times, with key applications in environmental monitoring and disaster assessment. To address limitations of existing methods, such as insufficient use of multiscale features and low efficiency in differential feature fusion, this paper proposes a cross-hierarchical multi-feature fusion network (CHMFFN) based on a multiscale encoder-decoder architecture. The front-end adopts a multiscale feature extraction subnetwork, built on an encoder-decoder backbone with residual connections and a dual-core channel-spatial attention (DCCSA) module to extract spectral-spatial-temporal features (SSTF). The encoder captures multiscale features from shallow details to deep semantics via residual blocks and convolutional kernels with varying receptive fields. The decoder restores spatial resolution and suppresses noise information through skip connections integrating encoder features. Additionally, a spectral-temporal change feature learning (STCFL) module learns cross-temporal change features at different levels, strengthening inter-temporal difference capture. An adaptive fusion of advanced features (AFAF) module dynamically balances hierarchical differential features via adaptive weights, enhancing representation of complex changes. Experiments on four public hyperspectral datasets show CHMFFN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Document image quality assessment (DIQA) is an important component for various applications, including optical character recognition (OCR), document restoration, and the evaluation of document image processing systems. In this paper, we introduce a subjective DIQA dataset DIQA-5000. The DIQA-5000 dataset comprises 5,000 document images, generated by applying multiple document enhancement techniques to 500 real-world images with diverse distortions. Each enhanced image was rated by 15 subjects across three rating dimensions: overall quality, sharpness, and color fidelity. Furthermore, we propose a specialized no-reference DIQA model that exploits document layout features to maintain quality perception at reduced resolutions to lower computational cost. Recognizing that image quality is influenced by both low-level and high-level visual features, we designed a feature fusion module to extract and integrate multi-level features from document images. To generate multi-dimensional scores, our model employs independent quality heads for each dimension to predict score distributions, allowing it to learn distinct aspects of document image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art general-purpose IQA models on both DIQA-5000 and an additional document image dataset focused on OCR accuracy.

- **Summary**: Video and audio inpainting for mixed audio-visual content has become a crucial task in multimedia editing recently. However, precisely removing an object and its corresponding audio from a video without affecting the rest of the scene remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose VAInpaint, a novel pipeline that first utilizes a segmentation model to generate masks and guide a video inpainting model in removing objects. At the same time, an LLM then analyzes the scene globally, while a region-specific model provides localized descriptions. Both the overall and regional descriptions will be inputted into an LLM, which will refine the content and turn it into text queries for our text-driven audio separation model. Our audio separation model is fine-tuned on a customized dataset comprising segmented MUSIC instrument images and VGGSound backgrounds to enhance its generalization performance. Experiments show that our method achieves performance comparable to current benchmarks in both audio and video inpainting.

- **Summary**: Adverse Weather Image Restoration (AWIR) is a highly challenging task due to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of weather-related degradations. Traditional task-specific methods often fail to generalize to unseen or complex degradation types, while recent prompt-learning approaches depend heavily on the degradation estimation capabilities of vision-language models, resulting in inconsistent restorations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LCDiff}, a novel framework comprising two key components: \textit{Lumina-Chroma Decomposition Network} (LCDN) and \textit{Lumina-Guided Diffusion Model} (LGDM). LCDN processes degraded images in the YCbCr color space, separately handling degradation-related luminance and degradation-invariant chrominance components. This decomposition effectively mitigates weather-induced degradation while preserving color fidelity. To further enhance restoration quality, LGDM leverages degradation-related luminance information as a guiding condition, eliminating the need for explicit degradation prompts. Additionally, LGDM incorporates a \textit{Dynamic Time Step Loss} to optimize the denoising network, ensuring a balanced recovery of both low- and high-frequency features in the image. Finally, we present DriveWeather, a comprehensive all-weather driving dataset designed to enable robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, setting a new benchmark in AWIR. The dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/fiwy0527/LCDiff.

- **Summary**: Surgical simulation is essential for medical training, enabling practitioners to develop crucial skills in a risk-free environment while improving patient safety and surgical outcomes. However, conventional methods for building simulation environments are cumbersome, time-consuming, and difficult to scale, often resulting in poor details and unrealistic simulations. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based framework to directly reconstruct interactive surgical scenes from endoscopic data while ensuring efficiency, rendering quality, and realism. A key challenge in this data-driven simulation paradigm is the restricted movement of endoscopic cameras, which limits viewpoint diversity. As a result, the Gaussian Splatting representation overfits specific perspectives, leading to reduced geometric accuracy. To address this issue, we introduce a novel virtual camera-based regularization method that adaptively samples virtual viewpoints around the scene and incorporates them into the optimization process to mitigate overfitting. An effective depth-based regularization is applied to both real and virtual views to further refine the scene geometry. To enable fast deformation simulation, we propose a sparse control node-based Material Point Method, which integrates physical properties into the reconstructed scene while significantly reducing computational costs. Experimental results on representative surgical data demonstrate that our method can efficiently reconstruct and simulate surgical scenes from sparse endoscopic views. Notably, our method takes only a few minutes to reconstruct the surgical scene and is able to produce physically plausible deformations in real-time with user-defined interactions.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust machine learning models. However, when training data follows a long-tailed distribution, the model's ability to accurately detect OOD samples is significantly compromised, due to the confusion between OOD samples and head/tail classes. To distinguish OOD samples from both head and tail classes, the separate class learning (SCL) approach has emerged as a promising solution, which separately conduct head-specific and tail-specific class learning. To this end, we examine the limitations of existing works of SCL and reveal that the OOD detection performance is notably influenced by the use of static scaling temperature value and the presence of uninformative outliers. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel approach termed Refined Separate Class Learning (RSCL), which leverages dynamic class-wise temperature adjustment to modulate the temperature parameter for each in-distribution class and informative outlier mining to identify diverse types of outliers based on their affinity with head and tail classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCL achieves superior OOD detection performance while improving the classification accuracy on in-distribution data.

- **Summary**: Multi-image Interleaved Reasoning aims to improve Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) ability to jointly comprehend and reason across multiple images and their associated textual contexts, introducing unique challenges beyond single-image or non-interleaved multi-image tasks. While current multi-image benchmarks overlook interleaved textual contexts and neglect distinct relationships between individual images and their associated texts, enabling models to reason over multi-image interleaved data may significantly enhance their comprehension of complex scenes and better capture cross-modal correlations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark MIR, requiring joint reasoning over multiple images accompanied by interleaved textual contexts to accurately associate image regions with corresponding texts and logically connect information across images. To enhance MLLMs ability to comprehend multi-image interleaved data, we introduce reasoning steps for each instance within the benchmark and propose a stage-wise curriculum learning strategy. This strategy follows an "easy to hard" approach, progressively guiding models from simple to complex scenarios, thereby enhancing their ability to handle challenging tasks. Extensive experiments benchmarking multiple MLLMs demonstrate that our method significantly enhances models reasoning performance on MIR and other established benchmarks. We believe that MIR will encourage further research into multi-image interleaved reasoning, facilitating advancements in MLLMs capability to handle complex inter-modal tasks.Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Shelly-coder239/MIRBench.

- **Summary**: Behavioural differences across organisms, whether healthy or pathological, are closely tied to the structure of their neural circuits. Yet, the fine-scale synaptic changes that give rise to these variations remain poorly understood, in part due to persistent challenges in detecting synapses reliably and at scale. Volume electron microscopy (EM) offers the resolution required to capture synaptic architecture, but automated detection remains difficult due to sparse annotations, morphological variability, and cross-dataset domain shifts. To address this, we make three key contributions. First, we curate a diverse EM benchmark spanning four datasets across two invertebrate species: adult and larval Drosophila melanogaster, and Megaphragma viggianii (micro-WASP). Second, we propose SimpSyn, a single-stage Residual U-Net trained to predict dual-channel spherical masks around pre- and post-synaptic sites, designed to prioritize training and inference speeds and annotation efficiency over architectural complexity. Third, we benchmark SimpSyn against Buhmann et al.'s Synful [1], a state-of-the-art multi-task model that jointly infers synaptic pairs. Despite its simplicity, SimpSyn consistently outperforms Synful in F1-score across all volumes for synaptic site detection. While generalization across datasets remains limited, SimpSyn achieves competitive performance when trained on the combined cohort. Finally, ablations reveal that simple post-processing strategies - such as local peak detection and distance-based filtering - yield strong performance without complex test-time heuristics. Taken together, our results suggest that lightweight models, when aligned with task structure, offer a practical and scalable solution for synapse detection in large-scale connectomic pipelines.

- **Summary**: Accurate crop disease diagnosis is essential for sustainable agriculture and global food security. Existing methods, which primarily rely on unimodal models such as image-based classifiers and object detectors, are limited in their ability to incorporate domain-specific agricultural knowledge and lack support for interactive, language-based understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) have opened new avenues for multimodal reasoning. However, their performance in agricultural contexts remains limited due to the absence of specialized datasets and insufficient domain adaptation. In this work, we propose AgriDoctor, a modular and extensible multimodal framework designed for intelligent crop disease diagnosis and agricultural knowledge interaction. As a pioneering effort to introduce agent-based multimodal reasoning into the agricultural domain, AgriDoctor offers a novel paradigm for building interactive and domain-adaptive crop health solutions. It integrates five core components: a router, classifier, detector, knowledge retriever and LLMs. To facilitate effective training and evaluation, we construct AgriMM, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 400000 annotated disease images, 831 expert-curated knowledge entries, and 300000 bilingual prompts for intent-driven tool selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AgriDoctor, trained on AgriMM, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LVLMs on fine-grained agricultural tasks, establishing a new paradigm for intelligent and sustainable farming applications.

- **Summary**: Breast ultrasound (BUS) is an essential tool for diagnosing breast lesions, with millions of examinations per year. However, publicly available high-quality BUS benchmarks for AI development are limited in data scale and annotation richness. In this work, we present BUS-CoT, a BUS dataset for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning analysis, which contains 11,439 images of 10,019 lesions from 4,838 patients and covers all 99 histopathology types. To facilitate research on incentivizing CoT reasoning, we construct the reasoning processes based on observation, feature, diagnosis and pathology labels, annotated and verified by experienced experts. Moreover, by covering lesions of all histopathology types, we aim to facilitate robust AI systems in rare cases, which can be error-prone in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained hashing has become a powerful solution for rapid and efficient image retrieval, particularly in scenarios requiring high discrimination between visually similar categories. To enable each hash bit to correspond to specific visual attributes, we propoe a novel method that harnesses learnable queries for attribute-aware hash codes learning. This method deploys a tailored set of queries to capture and represent nuanced attribute-level information within the hashing process, thereby enhancing both the interpretability and relevance of each hash bit. Building on this query-based optimization framework, we incorporate an auxiliary branch to help alleviate the challenges of complex landscape optimization often encountered with low-bit hash codes. This auxiliary branch models high-order attribute interactions, reinforcing the robustness and specificity of the generated hash codes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method generates attribute-aware hash codes and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in retrieval accuracy and robustness, especially for low-bit hash codes, underscoring its potential in fine-grained image hashing tasks.

- **Summary**: Nonlinear manifolds are widespread in deep visual features, where Euclidean distances often fail to capture true similarity. This limitation becomes particularly severe in prototype-based interpretable fine-grained recognition, where subtle semantic distinctions are essential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel paradigm for prototype-based recognition that anchors similarity within the intrinsic geometry of deep features. Specifically, we distill the latent manifold structure of each class into a diffusion space and introduce a differentiable Nystr\"om interpolation, making the geometry accessible to both unseen samples and learnable prototypes. To ensure efficiency, we employ compact per-class landmark sets with periodic updates. This design keeps the embedding aligned with the evolving backbone, enabling fast and scalable inference. Extensive experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show that our GeoProto framework produces prototypes focusing on semantically aligned parts, significantly outperforming Euclidean prototype networks.

- **Summary**: Echocardiography is a vital non-invasive modality for cardiac assessment, with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) serving as a key indicator of heart function. Existing LVEF estimation methods depend on large-scale annotated video datasets, which are costly and limit adaptability across various clinical settings. Recent vision-language models for echocardiography, such as EchoCLIP, apply image-to-text pretraining but fail to capture crucial temporal dynamics and localized cardiac structures essential for accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose CardiacCLIP, a video-based framework that enhances LVEF prediction through attention-based frame aggregation and multi-resolution input scaling. Specifically, we introduce MFL (Multi Frame Learning), a novel attention-based mechanism for selectively fusing informative frames, and EchoZoom, a multi-scale feature extraction strategy that refines spatial representations of cardiac structures. As a novel adaptation of CLIP models for few-shot echocardiogram video analysis, our approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, reducing MAE by 2.07 on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset under 1-shot setting.

- **Summary**: Visual affordance learning is crucial for robots to understand and interact effectively with the physical world. Recent advances in this field attempt to leverage pre-trained knowledge of vision-language foundation models to learn affordance properties with limited training data, providing a novel paradigm for visual affordance learning. However, these methods overlook the significance of maintaining feature alignment between visual images and language descriptions for identifying affordance areas with textual guidance, and thus may lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we present an informative framework for text-guided affordance learning, which involves information-based constraints to achieve text-image alignment at feature level. Specifically, we design an affordance mutual information constraint that helps learn appropriate textual prompts and task-oriented visual features simultaneously by maximizing the mutual information between the features of the affordance areas in the input images and the corresponding textual prompts. In addition, we propose an object-level information constraint that maximizes the mutual information between the visual features of a given object and the text features of the category it belongs to. This enables the model to capture high-quality representations for the object, providing more reliable semantic priors for identifying affordance regions. Experimental results on the AGD20K dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and achieves the new state-of-the-art in one-shot affordance learning.

- **Summary**: While one-stage detectors like YOLOv8 offer fast training speed, they often under-perform on detecting small objects as a trade-off. This becomes even more critical when detecting tiny objects in aerial imagery due to low-resolution targets and cluttered backgrounds. To address this, we introduce three enhancement strategies -- input image resolution adjustment, data augmentation, and attention mechanisms -- that can be easily implemented on YOLOv8. We demonstrate that image size enlargement and the proper use of augmentation can lead to enhancement. Additionally, we designed a Mixture of Orthogonal Neural-modules Network (MoonNet) pipeline which consists of attention-augmented CNNs. Two well-known attention modules, the Squeeze-and-Excitation Block (SE Block) and the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), were integrated into the backbone of YOLOv8 with an increased number of channels, and the MoonNet backbone obtained improved detection accuracy compared to the original YOLOv8. MoonNet further proved its adaptability and potential by achieving state-of-the-art performance on a tiny-object benchmark when integrated with the YOLC model.

- **Summary**: Accurate RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) crowd counting is crucial for public safety in challenging conditions. While recent Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global context, their inherent lack of spatial inductive bias causes attention to spread to irrelevant background regions, compromising crowd localization precision. Furthermore, effectively bridging the gap between these distinct modalities remains a major hurdle. To tackle this, we propose the Dual Modulation Framework, comprising two modules: Spatially Modulated Attention (SMA), which improves crowd localization by using a learnable Spatial Decay Mask to penalize attention between distant tokens and prevent focus from spreading to the background; and Adaptive Fusion Modulation (AFM), which implements a dynamic gating mechanism to prioritize the most reliable modality for adaptive cross-modal fusion. Extensive experiments on RGB-T crowd counting datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to previous works.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful alternative to NeRF-based approaches, enabling real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis through explicit, optimizable 3D Gaussians. However, 3DGS suffers from significant memory overhead due to its reliance on per-Gaussian parameters to model view-dependent effects and anisotropic shapes. While recent works propose compressing 3DGS with neural fields, these methods struggle to capture high-frequency spatial variations in Gaussian properties, leading to degraded reconstruction of fine details. We present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), a novel scene representation that combines the strengths of explicit Gaussians and neural fields. HyRF decomposes the scene into (1) a compact set of explicit Gaussians storing only critical high-frequency parameters and (2) grid-based neural fields that predict remaining properties. To enhance representational capacity, we introduce a decoupled neural field architecture, separately modeling geometry (scale, opacity, rotation) and view-dependent color. Additionally, we propose a hybrid rendering scheme that composites Gaussian splatting with a neural field-predicted background, addressing limitations in distant scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that HyRF achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing model size by over 20 times compared to 3DGS and maintaining real-time performance.

- **Summary**: Video action recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, but state-of-the-art models are often computationally expensive and rely on extensive video pre-training. In parallel, large-scale vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition. Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%) baselines. Our work provides a new, highly efficient baseline for video understanding that effectively bridges the gap between large static models and dynamic, low-cost motion cues.

- **Summary**: Detecting and localizing poultry is essential for advancing smart poultry farming. Despite the progress of detection-centric methods, challenges persist in free-range settings due to multiscale targets, obstructions, and complex or dynamic backgrounds. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an innovative poultry detection approach named SFN-YOLO that utilizes scale-aware fusion. This approach combines detailed local features with broader global context to improve detection in intricate environments. Furthermore, we have developed a new expansive dataset (M-SCOPE) tailored for varied free-range conditions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our model achieves an mAP of 80.7% with just 7.2M parameters, which is 35.1% fewer than the benchmark, while retaining strong generalization capability across different domains. The efficient and real-time detection capabilities of SFN-YOLO support automated smart poultry farming. The code and dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/chenjessiee/SFN-YOLO.

- **Summary**: Despite their generative power, diffusion models struggle to maintain style consistency across images conditioned on the same style prompt, hindering their practical deployment in creative workflows. While several training-free methods attempt to solve this, they are constrained to the U-Net architecture, which not only leads to low-quality results and artifacts like object repetition but also renders them incompatible with superior Diffusion Transformer (DiT). To address these issues, we introduce AlignedGen, a novel training-free framework that enhances style consistency across images generated by DiT models. Our work first reveals a critical insight: naive attention sharing fails in DiT due to conflicting positional signals from improper position embeddings. We introduce Shifted Position Embedding (ShiftPE), an effective solution that resolves this conflict by allocating a non-overlapping set of positional indices to each image. Building on this foundation, we develop Advanced Attention Sharing (AAS), a suite of three techniques meticulously designed to fully unleash the potential of attention sharing within the DiT. Furthermore, to broaden the applicability of our method, we present an efficient query, key, and value feature extraction algorithm, enabling our method to seamlessly incorporate external images as style references. Extensive experimental results validate that our method effectively enhances style consistency across generated images while maintaining precise text-to-image alignment.

- **Summary**: Uncertainty estimation has been widely studied in medical image segmentation as a tool to provide reliability, particularly in deep learning approaches. However, previous methods generally lack effective supervision in uncertainty estimation, leading to low interpretability and robustness of the predictions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to guide the learning of uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce three principles about the relationships between the uncertainty and the image gradients around boundaries and noise. Based on these principles, two uncertainty supervision losses are designed. These losses enhance the alignment between model predictions and human interpretation. Accordingly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics for evaluating the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method can achieve competitive segmentation performance and superior results in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios while significantly improving the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty estimation.

- **Summary**: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for surgical quality assessment promise to democratize access to expertise, with applications in training, guidance, and accreditation. This study presents the SAGES Critical View of Safety (CVS) Challenge, the first AI competition organized by a surgical society, using the CVS in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a universally recommended yet inconsistently performed safety step, as an exemplar of surgical quality assessment. A global collaboration across 54 institutions in 24 countries engaged hundreds of clinicians and engineers to curate 1,000 videos annotated by 20 surgical experts according to a consensus-validated protocol. The challenge addressed key barriers to real-world deployment in surgery, including achieving high performance, capturing uncertainty in subjective assessment, and ensuring robustness to clinical variability. To enable this scale of effort, we developed EndoGlacier, a framework for managing large, heterogeneous surgical video and multi-annotator workflows. Thirteen international teams participated, achieving up to a 17\% relative gain in assessment performance, over 80\% reduction in calibration error, and a 17\% relative improvement in robustness over the state-of-the-art. Analysis of results highlighted methodological trends linked to model performance, providing guidance for future research toward robust, clinically deployable AI for surgical quality assessment.

- **Summary**: Collaborative perception aims to extend sensing coverage and improve perception accuracy by sharing information among multiple agents. However, due to differences in viewpoints and spatial positions, agents often acquire heterogeneous observations. Existing intermediate fusion methods primarily focus on aligning similar features, often overlooking the perceptual diversity among agents. To address this limitation, we propose CoBEVMoE, a novel collaborative perception framework that operates in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space and incorporates a Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (DMoE) architecture. In DMoE, each expert is dynamically generated based on the input features of a specific agent, enabling it to extract distinctive and reliable cues while attending to shared semantics. This design allows the fusion process to explicitly model both feature similarity and heterogeneity across agents. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Expert Metric Loss (DEML) to enhance inter-expert diversity and improve the discriminability of the fused representation. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V and DAIR-V2X-C datasets demonstrate that CoBEVMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, it improves the IoU for Camera-based BEV segmentation by +1.5% on OPV2V and the AP@50 for LiDAR-based 3D object detection by +3.0% on DAIR-V2X-C, verifying the effectiveness of expert-based heterogeneous feature modeling in multi-agent collaborative perception.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image diffusion models can generate striking visuals from text prompts, but they often fail to maintain subject consistency across generations and contexts. One major limitation of current fine-tuning approaches is the inherent trade-off between quality and efficiency. Fine-tuning large models improves fidelity but is computationally expensive, while fine-tuning lightweight models improves efficiency but compromises image fidelity. Moreover, fine-tuning pre-trained models on a small set of images of the subject can damage the existing priors, resulting in suboptimal results. To this end, we present Stencil, a novel framework that jointly employs two diffusion models during inference. Stencil efficiently fine-tunes a lightweight model on images of the subject, while a large frozen pre-trained model provides contextual guidance during inference, injecting rich priors to enhance generation with minimal overhead. Stencil excels at generating high-fidelity, novel renditions of the subject in less than a minute, delivering state-of-the-art performance and setting a new benchmark in subject-driven generation.

- **Summary**: Industrial vision inspection requires high accuracy under stringent resource constraints, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) deliver strong reasoning capabilities but incur prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight edge models often fail on complex cases. In this paper, we present SAEC, a scene-aware enhanced edge-cloud collaborative industrial vision inspection framework with MLLM. The framework is composed of three synergistic components: (1) Efficient MLLM Fine-Tuning for Complex Defect Inspection, (2) Lightweight Multiscale Scene-Complexity Estimation, and (3) Adaptive Edge-Cloud Scheduler. Together, these modules enable robust defect detection by tailoring multimodal reasoning to scene complexity and dynamically balancing computation between edge and cloud resources. Experimental results on MVTec AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrate that SAEC attains 85.11% and 82.72% accuracy, surpassing Qwen by 22.1% and 20.8%, and LLaVA by 33.3% and 31.6%. It also reduces runtime by up to 22.4% and cuts energy per correct decision by 40%-74%. The code is available at https://github.com/YuHao-Tian/SAEC.

- **Summary**: Head and gaze dynamics are crucial in expressive 3D facial animation for conveying emotion and intention. However, existing methods frequently address facial components in isolation, overlooking the intricate coordination between gaze, head motion, and speech. The scarcity of high-quality gaze-annotated datasets hinders the development of data-driven models capable of capturing realistic, personalized gaze control. To address these challenges, we propose StyGazeTalk, an audio-driven method that generates synchronized gaze and head motion styles. We extract speaker-specific motion traits from gaze-head sequences with a multi-layer LSTM structure incorporating a style encoder, enabling the generation of diverse animation styles. We also introduce a high-precision multimodal dataset comprising eye-tracked gaze, audio, head pose, and 3D facial parameters, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluating head and gaze control models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates realistic, temporally coherent, and style-aware head-gaze motions, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in audio-driven facial animation.

- **Summary**: The automated prediction of facial beauty is a benchmark task in affective computing that requires a sophisticated understanding of both local aesthetic details (e.g., skin texture) and global facial harmony (e.g., symmetry, proportions). Existing models, based on either Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs), exhibit inherent architectural biases that limit their performance; CNNs excel at local feature extraction but struggle with long-range dependencies, while ViTs model global relationships at a significant computational cost. This paper introduces the \textbf{Mamba-Diffusion Network (MD-Net)}, a novel dual-stream architecture that resolves this trade-off by delegating specialized roles to state-of-the-art models. The first stream leverages a frozen U-Net encoder from a pre-trained latent diffusion model, providing a powerful generative prior for fine-grained aesthetic qualities. The second stream employs a Vision Mamba (Vim), a modern state-space model, to efficiently capture global facial structure with linear-time complexity. By synergistically integrating these complementary representations through a cross-attention mechanism, MD-Net creates a holistic and nuanced feature space for prediction. Evaluated on the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, MD-Net sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9235} and demonstrating the significant potential of hybrid architectures that fuse generative and sequential modeling paradigms for complex visual assessment tasks.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of medical images is challenging due to unclear lesion boundaries and mask variability. We introduce \emph{Segmentation Sch\"{o}dinger Bridge (SSB)}, the first application of Sch\"{o}dinger Bridge for ambiguous medical image segmentation, modelling joint image-mask dynamics to enhance performance. SSB preserves structural integrity, delineates unclear boundaries without additional guidance, and maintains diversity using a novel loss function. We further propose the \emph{Diversity Divergence Index} ($D_{DDI}$) to quantify inter-rater variability, capturing both diversity and consensus. SSB achieves state-of-the-art performance on LIDC-IDRI, COCA, and RACER (in-house) datasets.

- **Summary**: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality globally, and echocardiography is critical for diagnosis of both common and congenital cardiac conditions. However, echocardiographic data for certain pathologies are scarce, hindering the development of robust automated diagnosis models. In this work, we propose Echo-Path, a novel generative framework to produce echocardiogram videos conditioned on specific cardiac pathologies. Echo-Path can synthesize realistic ultrasound video sequences that exhibit targeted abnormalities, focusing here on atrial septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our approach introduces a pathology-conditioning mechanism into a state-of-the-art echo video generator, allowing the model to learn and control disease-specific structural and motion patterns in the heart. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the synthetic videos achieve low distribution distances, indicating high visual fidelity. Clinically, the generated echoes exhibit plausible pathology markers. Furthermore, classifiers trained on our synthetic data generalize well to real data and, when used to augment real training sets, it improves downstream diagnosis of ASD and PAH by 7\% and 8\% respectively.

- **Summary**: Analyzing cultural-heritage artifacts remains challenging for MLLMs: general models lack domain expertise, and SFT often overfits superficial patterns, yielding brittle reasoning for authentication and historical attribution. This raises the question of how to equip MLLMs with robust, expert-level reasoning for ancient Greek pottery. We present VaseVL, an SFT-then-RL system that turns evaluation into supervision: we construct a taxonomy of question types, probe the SFT model to localize type-specific performance gaps, and optimize with type-conditioned, compositionality-oriented rewards targeting those gaps. We also release VaseVQA, a comprehensive benchmark of 31,773 images designed to probe deep understanding. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on style classification and historical attribution with marked gains in compositional robustness over SFT-only baselines, validating diagnosis-guided, taxonomy-conditioned reward engineering and providing a reusable resource for future research. Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/VaseVQA.

- **Summary**: Generating realistic 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in remote sensing, robotics, and digital object modeling. Existing generative approaches primarily capture geometry, and when semantics are considered, they are typically imposed post hoc through external segmentation or clustering rather than integrated into the generative process itself. We propose a diffusion-based framework that embeds per-point semantic conditioning directly within generation. Each point is associated with a conditional variable corresponding to its semantic label, which guides the diffusion dynamics and enables the joint synthesis of geometry and semantics. This design produces point clouds that are both structurally coherent and segmentation-aware, with object parts explicitly represented during synthesis. Through a comparative analysis of guided and unguided diffusion processes, we demonstrate the significant impact of conditional variables on diffusion dynamics and generation quality. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, producing detailed and accurate 3D point clouds tailored to specific parts and features.

- **Summary**: Pre-training strategies play a critical role in advancing the performance of transformer-based models for 3D point cloud tasks. In this paper, we introduce Point-RTD (Replaced Token Denoising), a novel pretraining strategy designed to improve token robustness through a corruption-reconstruction framework. Unlike traditional mask-based reconstruction tasks that hide data segments for later prediction, Point-RTD corrupts point cloud tokens and leverages a discriminator-generator architecture for denoising. This shift enables more effective learning of structural priors and significantly enhances model performance and efficiency. On the ShapeNet dataset, Point-RTD reduces reconstruction error by over 93% compared to PointMAE, and achieves more than 14x lower Chamfer Distance on the test set. Our method also converges faster and yields higher classification accuracy on ShapeNet, ModelNet10, and ModelNet40 benchmarks, clearly outperforming the baseline Point-MAE framework in every case.

- **Summary**: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) are a natural implicit representation for open surfaces but, unlike Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), are challenging to triangulate into explicit meshes. This is especially true at high resolutions where neural UDFs exhibit higher noise levels, which makes it hard to capture fine details. Most current techniques perform within single voxels without reference to their neighborhood, resulting in missing surface and holes where the UDF is ambiguous or noisy. We show that this can be remedied by performing several passes and by reasoning on previously extracted surface elements to incorporate neighborhood information. Our key contribution is an iterative neural network that does this and progressively improves surface recovery within each voxel by spatially propagating information from increasingly distant neighbors. Unlike single-pass methods, our approach integrates newly detected surfaces, distance values, and gradients across multiple iterations, effectively correcting errors and stabilizing extraction in challenging regions. Experiments on diverse 3D models demonstrate that our method produces significantly more accurate and complete meshes than existing approaches, particularly for complex geometries, enabling UDF surface extraction at higher resolutions where traditional methods fail.

- **Summary**: This paper presents MirrorSAM2, the first framework that adapts Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to the task of RGB-D video mirror segmentation. MirrorSAM2 addresses key challenges in mirror detection, such as reflection ambiguity and texture confusion, by introducing four tailored modules: a Depth Warping Module for RGB and depth alignment, a Depth-guided Multi-Scale Point Prompt Generator for automatic prompt generation, a Frequency Detail Attention Fusion Module to enhance structural boundaries, and a Mirror Mask Decoder with a learnable mirror token for refined segmentation. By fully leveraging the complementarity between RGB and depth, MirrorSAM2 extends SAM2's capabilities to the prompt-free setting. To our knowledge, this is the first work to enable SAM2 for automatic video mirror segmentation. Experiments on the VMD and DVMD benchmark demonstrate that MirrorSAM2 achieves SOTA performance, even under challenging conditions such as small mirrors, weak boundaries, and strong reflections.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a Diffusion Model-Optimized Neural Radiance Field (DT-NeRF) method, aimed at enhancing detail recovery and multi-view consistency in 3D scene reconstruction. By combining diffusion models with Transformers, DT-NeRF effectively restores details under sparse viewpoints and maintains high accuracy in complex geometric scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that DT-NeRF significantly outperforms traditional NeRF and other state-of-the-art methods on the Matterport3D and ShapeNet datasets, particularly in metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, Chamfer Distance, and Fidelity. Ablation experiments further confirm the critical role of the diffusion and Transformer modules in the model's performance, with the removal of either module leading to a decline in performance. The design of DT-NeRF showcases the synergistic effect between modules, providing an efficient and accurate solution for 3D scene reconstruction. Future research may focus on further optimizing the model, exploring more advanced generative models and network architectures to enhance its performance in large-scale dynamic scenes.

- **Summary**: We introduce SPFSplatV2, an efficient feed-forward framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training and inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a canonical space from unposed inputs. A masked attention mechanism is introduced to efficiently estimate target poses during training, while a reprojection loss enforces pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives, providing stronger geometric constraints. We further demonstrate the compatibility of our training framework with different reconstruction architectures, resulting in two model variants. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose supervision, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain novel view synthesis, even under extreme viewpoint changes and limited image overlap, and surpasses recent methods that rely on geometric supervision for relative pose estimation. By eliminating dependence on ground-truth poses, our method offers the scalability to leverage larger and more diverse datasets. Code and pretrained models will be available on our project page: https://ranrhuang.github.io/spfsplatv2/.

- **Summary**: Efficient data compression is crucial for the storage and transmission of visual data. However, in facial expression recognition (FER) tasks, lossy compression often leads to feature degradation and reduced accuracy. To address these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end model designed to preserve critical features and enhance both compression and recognition performance. A custom loss function is introduced to optimize the model, tailored to balance compression and recognition performance effectively. This study also examines the influence of varying loss term weights on this balance. Experimental results indicate that fine-tuning the compression model alone improves classification accuracy by 0.71% and compression efficiency by 49.32%, while joint optimization achieves significant gains of 4.04% in accuracy and 89.12% in efficiency. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that the jointly optimized classification model maintains high accuracy on both compressed and uncompressed data, while the compression model reliably preserves image details, even at high compression rates.

- **Summary**: One way illustrators engage in disciplined drawing - the process of drawing to improve technical skills - is through studying and replicating reference images. However, for many novice and intermediate digital artists, knowing how to approach studying a reference image can be challenging. It can also be difficult to receive immediate feedback on their works-in-progress. To help these users develop their professional vision, we propose ArtKrit, a tool that scaffolds the process of replicating a reference image into three main steps: composition, value, and color. At each step, our tool offers computational guidance, such as adaptive composition line generation, and automatic feedback, such as value and color accuracy. Evaluating this tool with intermediate digital artists revealed that ArtKrit could flexibly accommodate their unique workflows. Our code and supplemental materials are available at https://majiaju.io/artkrit .

- **Summary**: Real-time Three-dimensional (3D) scene representation is a foundational element that supports a broad spectrum of cutting-edge applications, including digital manufacturing, Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR), and the emerging metaverse. Despite advancements in real-time communication and computing, achieving a balance between timeliness and fidelity in 3D scene representation remains a challenge. This work investigates a wireless network where multiple homogeneous mobile robots, equipped with cameras, capture an environment and transmit images to an edge server over channels for 3D representation. We propose a contextual-bandit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework incorporating both Age of Information (AoI) and semantic information to optimize image selection for representation, balancing data freshness and representation quality. Two policies -- the $\omega$-threshold and $\omega$-wait policies -- together with two benchmark methods are evaluated, timeliness embedding and weighted sum, on standard datasets and baseline 3D scene representation models. Experimental results demonstrate improved representation fidelity while maintaining low latency, offering insight into the model's decision-making process. This work advances real-time 3D scene representation by optimizing the trade-off between timeliness and fidelity in dynamic environments.

- **Summary**: Building compliance checking (BCC) is a critical process for ensuring that constructed facilities meet regulatory standards. A core component of BCC is the accurate enumeration of facility types and their spatial distribution. Despite its importance, this problem has been largely overlooked in the literature, posing a significant challenge for BCC and leaving a critical gap in existing workflows. Performing this task manually is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance automation by combining visual recognition with reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a new task for BCC: automated facility enumeration, which involves validating the quantity of each facility type against statutory requirements. To address it, we propose a novel method that integrates door detection with LLM-based reasoning. We are the first to apply LLMs to this task and further enhance their performance through a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) pipeline. Our approach generalizes well across diverse datasets and facility types. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic floor plan data demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

- **Summary**: Visual teach-and-repeat navigation enables robots to autonomously traverse previously demonstrated paths by comparing current sensory input with recorded trajectories. However, conventional frame-based cameras fundamentally limit system responsiveness: their fixed frame rates (typically 30-60 Hz) create inherent latency between environmental changes and control responses. Here we present the first event-camera-based visual teach-and-repeat system. To achieve this, we develop a frequency-domain cross-correlation framework that transforms the event stream matching problem into computationally efficient Fourier space multiplications, capable of exceeding 300Hz processing rates, an order of magnitude faster than frame-based approaches. By exploiting the binary nature of event frames and applying image compression techniques, we further enhance the computational speed of the cross-correlation process without sacrificing localization accuracy. Extensive experiments using a Prophesee EVK4 HD event camera mounted on an AgileX Scout Mini robot demonstrate successful autonomous navigation across 4000+ meters of indoor and outdoor trajectories. Our system achieves ATEs below 24 cm while maintaining consistent high-frequency control updates. Our evaluations show that our approach achieves substantially higher update rates compared to conventional frame-based systems, underscoring the practical viability of event-based perception for real-time robotic navigation.
