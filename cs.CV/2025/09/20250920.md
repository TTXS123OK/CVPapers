- **Summary**: Handwriting is significantly affected by neurological disorders (ND) such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prior works have analyzed handwriting tasks using feature-based approaches or computer-vision techniques, but these methods have struggled to generalize across multiple datasets, particularly between temporal features represented as time-series and images. We propose a framework that leverages both time-series and images of handwriting through a joint classifier, based on a ResNet50 pretrained on ImageNet-1k. Binary classification experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performances on existing time-series and image datasets, with significant improvement on specific drawing and writing tasks from the NeuroLogical Signals (NLS) dataset. In particular, the proposed model demonstrates improved performance on Draw Clock and Spiral tasks. Additionally, cross-dataset and multi-dataset experiments were consistently able to achieve high F1 scores, up to 98 for PD detection, highlighting the potential of the proposed model to generalize over different forms of handwriting signals, and enhance the detection of motor deficits in ND.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deliver impressive performance in understanding visual content with language instructions. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs, which hinders real-time use on edge consumer devices such as AR/VR devices. Existing efficiency methods commonly prune visual tokens using learned saliency, sparse attention schedules, or controller policies, but they often require architectural modification or access to intermediate activations. These pipelines add inference-time modules that increase compute and memory and often lead to an accuracy trade-off. Moreover, they also suffer from misalignment between the prompts and the region of interest in the images. Without human guidance, the model may focus on the wrong regions and miss small, high-frequency details when prompts or scenes change. In this paper, we propose GazeVLM, a training-free framework that uses the human eye gaze as a natural supervisory signal to allocate computation where it matters. By extracting gaze-driven regions of interest (ROIs) and optionally combining them with a low-resolution global view, GazeVLM mimics fovea-periphery perception to cut redundant visual tokens while preserving task-relevant details. We evaluate the visual question answering tasks on Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B on the VOILA-COCO benchmark with human gaze. Quality of the answer is assessed by GPT-4o pairwise judging and a weighted score over coverage, accuracy, details, and fluency. Efficiency is measured by token counts and FLOPs. GazeVLM reduces visual tokens by up to 93.1%, total tokens by up to 59.6%, and FLOPs by 50%, while keeping better answer quality relative to full-resolution baselines. Our results show that aligning model computation with human gaze offers a simple, plug-and-play path toward efficient VLM inference on consumer devices.

- **Summary**: Falls among seniors are a major public health issue. Existing solutions using wearable sensors, ambient sensors, and RGB-based vision systems face challenges in reliability, user compliance, and practicality. Studies indicate that stakeholders, such as older adults and eldercare facilities, prefer non-wearable, passive, privacy-preserving, and real-time fall detection systems that require no user interaction. This study proposes an advanced thermal fall detection method using a Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (BiConvLSTM) model, enhanced with spatial, temporal, feature, self, and general attention mechanisms. Through systematic experimentation across hundreds of model variations exploring the integration of attention mechanisms, recurrent modules, and motion flow, we identified top-performing architectures. Among them, BiConvLSTM achieved state-of-the-art performance with a ROC-AUC of $99.7\%$ on the TSF dataset and demonstrated robust results on TF-66, a newly emerged, diverse, and privacy-preserving benchmark. These results highlight the generalizability and practicality of the proposed model, setting new standards for thermal fall detection and paving the way toward deployable, high-performance solutions.



### Octree Latent Diffusion for Semantic 3D Scene Generation and Completion

- **Summary**: The completion, extension, and generation of 3D semantic scenes are an interrelated set of capabilities that are useful for robotic navigation and exploration. Existing approaches seek to decouple these problems and solve them oneoff. Additionally, these approaches are often domain-specific, requiring separate models for different data distributions, e.g. indoor vs. outdoor scenes. To unify these techniques and provide cross-domain compatibility, we develop a single framework that can perform scene completion, extension, and generation in both indoor and outdoor scenes, which we term Octree Latent Semantic Diffusion. Our approach operates directly on an efficient dual octree graph latent representation: a hierarchical, sparse, and memory-efficient occupancy structure. This technique disentangles synthesis into two stages: (i) structure diffusion, which predicts binary split signals to construct a coarse occupancy octree, and (ii) latent semantic diffusion, which generates semantic embeddings decoded by a graph VAE into voxellevel semantic labels. To perform semantic scene completion or extension, our model leverages inference-time latent inpainting, or outpainting respectively. These inference-time methods use partial LiDAR scans or maps to condition generation, without the need for retraining or finetuning. We demonstrate highquality structure, coherent semantics, and robust completion from single LiDAR scans, as well as zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution LiDAR data. These results indicate that completion-through-generation in a dual octree graph latent space is a practical and scalable alternative to regression-based pipelines for real-world robotic perception tasks.

- **Summary**: Synthetic data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet current state-of-the-art video generation models, despite their visual realism, suffer from subtle geometric distortions that limit their utility for downstream perception tasks. We identify and quantify this critical issue, demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes, RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%, narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for AD development.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces CommonForms, a web-scale dataset for form field detection. It casts the problem of form field detection as object detection: given an image of a page, predict the location and type (Text Input, Choice Button, Signature) of form fields. The dataset is constructed by filtering Common Crawl to find PDFs that have fillable elements. Starting with 8 million documents, the filtering process is used to arrive at a final dataset of roughly 55k documents that have over 450k pages. Analysis shows that the dataset contains a diverse mixture of languages and domains; one third of the pages are non-English, and among the 14 classified domains, no domain makes up more than 25% of the dataset.   In addition, this paper presents a family of form field detectors, FFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, which attain a very high average precision on the CommonForms test set. Each model cost less than $500 to train. Ablation results show that high-resolution inputs are crucial for high-quality form field detection, and that the cleaning process improves data efficiency over using all PDFs that have fillable fields in Common Crawl. A qualitative analysis shows that they outperform a popular, commercially available PDF reader that can prepare forms. Unlike the most popular commercially available solutions, FFDNet can predict checkboxes in addition to text and signature fields. This is, to our knowledge, the first large scale dataset released for form field detection, as well as the first open source models. The dataset, models, and code will be released at https://github.com/jbarrow/commonforms

- **Summary**: Recently, latent diffusion models has demonstrated promising performance in real-world video super-resolution (VSR) task, which can reconstruct high-quality videos from distorted low-resolution input through multiple diffusion steps. Compared to image super-resolution (ISR), VSR methods needs to process each frame in a video, which poses challenges to its inference efficiency. However, video quality and inference efficiency have always been a trade-off for the diffusion-based VSR methods. In this work, we propose One-Step Diffusion model for real-world Video Super-Resolution, namely OS-DiffVSR. Specifically, we devise a novel adjacent frame adversarial training paradigm, which can significantly improve the quality of synthetic videos. Besides, we devise a multi-frame fusion mechanism to maintain inter-frame temporal consistency and reduce the flicker in video. Extensive experiments on several popular VSR benchmarks demonstrate that OS-DiffVSR can even achieve better quality than existing diffusion-based VSR methods that require dozens of sampling steps.



### SlowFast-SCI: Slow-Fast Deep Unfolding Learning for Spectral Compressive Imaging

- **Summary**: Humans learn in two complementary ways: a slow, cumulative process that builds broad, general knowledge, and a fast, on-the-fly process that captures specific experiences. Existing deep-unfolding methods for spectral compressive imaging (SCI) mirror only the slow component-relying on heavy pre-training with many unfolding stages-yet they lack the rapid adaptation needed to handle new optical configurations. As a result, they falter on out-of-distribution cameras, especially in bespoke spectral setups unseen during training. This depth also incurs heavy computation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we introduce SlowFast-SCI, a dual-speed framework seamlessly integrated into any deep unfolding network beyond SCI systems. During slow learning, we pre-train or reuse a priors-based backbone and distill it via imaging guidance into a compact fast-unfolding model. In the fast learning stage, lightweight adaptation modules are embedded within each block and trained self-supervised at test time via a dual-domain loss-without retraining the backbone. To the best of our knowledge, SlowFast-SCI is the first test-time adaptation-driven deep unfolding framework for efficient, self-adaptive spectral reconstruction. Its dual-stage design unites offline robustness with on-the-fly per-sample calibration-yielding over 70% reduction in parameters and FLOPs, up to 5.79 dB PSNR improvement on out-of-distribution data, preserved cross-domain adaptability, and a 4x faster adaptation speed. In addition, its modularity integrates with any deep-unfolding network, paving the way for self-adaptive, field-deployable imaging and expanded computational imaging modalities.

- **Summary**: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) have made substantial progress in various tasks that require a combined understanding of visual and textual content, particularly in cultural understanding tasks, with the emergence of new cultural datasets. However, these datasets frequently fall short of providing cultural reasoning while underrepresenting many cultures. In this paper, we introduce the Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB), focusing on cultural reasoning with a novel approach that requires VLMs to reason on culturally rich images in two stages: i) selecting the correct visual option with multiple-choice visual question answering (VQA), and ii) segmenting the relevant cultural artifact as evidence of reasoning. Visual options in the first stage are systematically organized into three types: those originating from the same country, those from different countries, or a mixed group. Notably, all options are derived from a singular category for each type. Progression to the second stage occurs only after a correct visual option is chosen. The SCB benchmark comprises 1,065 images that capture 138 cultural artifacts across five categories from seven Southeast Asia countries, whose diverse cultures are often overlooked, accompanied by 3,178 questions, of which 1,093 are unique and meticulously curated by human annotators. Our evaluation of various VLMs reveals the complexities involved in cross-modal cultural reasoning and highlights the disparity between visual reasoning and spatial grounding in culturally nuanced scenarios. The SCB serves as a crucial benchmark for identifying these shortcomings, thereby guiding future developments in the field of cultural reasoning. https://github.com/buraksatar/SeeingCulture

- **Summary**: Generating realistic videos with diffusion transformers demands significant computation, with attention layers the central bottleneck; even producing a short clip requires running a transformer over a very long sequence of embeddings, e.g., more than 30K embeddings for a 5-second video, incurring significant latency. Prior work aims to mitigate this bottleneck by exploiting sparsity in the attention layers to reduce computation. However, these works typically rely on block-sparse attention, which skips score computation only when all entries in a block of attention scores (corresponding to M queries and M keys, with M = 64 typically) are zero. This coarse-granular skipping of attention scores does not fully exploit sparsity in the attention map and leaves room for improvement. In this work, we propose FG-Attn, a sparse attention mechanism for long-context diffusion transformers that leverages sparsity at a fine granularity. Unlike block-sparse attention, which skips entire MxM blocks, our approach skips computations at the granularity of Mx1 slices of the attention map. Each slice is produced by query-key dot products between a block of query vectors and a single key. To implement our proposed sparse attention mechanism, we develop a new efficient bulk-load operation called asynchronous-gather load. This load operation gathers a sparse set of relevant key-value vectors from memory and arranges them into packed tiles in the GPU's shared memory. Only a sparse set of keys relevant to those queries are loaded into shared memory when computing attention for a block of queries, in contrast to loading full blocks of key tokens in block-sparse attention. Our fine-grained sparse attention, applied to video diffusion models, achieves an average 1.55X (up to 1.65X) speedup for 5 second, 480p videos, and an average 1.41X (up to 1.49X) for 5 second, 720p videos on a single H100 GPU.

- **Summary**: This work proposes the Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM) to learn real-world pixel dynamicity for visual tracking. LBM decomposes visual representations into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.

- **Summary**: Video captions offer concise snapshots of actors, objects, and actions within a video, serving as valuable assets for applications such as question answering and event localization. However, acquiring human annotations for video captions is costly or even impractical, especially when dealing with diverse video domains. Existing models trained on supervised datasets face challenges in evaluating performance across different domains due to the reliance on reference-based evaluation protocols, which necessitate ground truth captions. This assumption is unrealistic for evaluating videos in the wild. To address these limitations, we propose a reference-free evaluation framework that does not require ground truth captions, focusing on factual grounding to ensure accurate assessment of caption quality. We introduce VC-Inspector, a novel caption quality evaluator that is both reference-free and factually grounded. Utilizing large language models, we generate pseudo captions of varying quality based on supervised data, which are subsequently used to train a multimodal model (i.e., Qwen2.5-VL) as the evaluator. Our approach demonstrates superior alignment with human judgments on the VATEX-Eval dataset, outperforming existing methods. The performance also generalizes to image caption datasets, Flickr8K-Expert and Flickr8K-CF, when viewing images as 1-frame videos. Overall, VC-Inspector offers a scalable and generalizable solution for evaluating the factual accuracy of video captions, paving the way for more effective and objective assessment methodologies in diverse video domains.

- **Summary**: Image fusion is a fundamental and important task in computer vision, aiming to combine complementary information from different modalities to fuse images. In recent years, diffusion models have made significant developments in the field of image fusion. However, diffusion models often require complex computations and redundant inference time, which reduces the applicability of these methods. To address this issue, we propose RFfusion, an efficient one-step diffusion model for image fusion based on Rectified Flow. We incorporate Rectified Flow into the image fusion task to straighten the sampling path in the diffusion model, achieving one-step sampling without the need for additional training, while still maintaining high-quality fusion results. Furthermore, we propose a task-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture tailored for image fusion, where the fusion operation is embedded within the latent space to further reduce computational complexity. To address the inherent discrepancy between conventional reconstruction-oriented VAE objectives and the requirements of image fusion, we introduce a two-stage training strategy. This approach facilitates the effective learning and integration of complementary information from multi-modal source images, thereby enabling the model to retain fine-grained structural details while significantly enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both inference speed and fusion quality.

- **Summary**: 3D occupancy prediction is critical for comprehensive scene understanding in vision-centric autonomous driving. Recent advances have explored utilizing 3D semantic Gaussians to model occupancy while reducing computational overhead, but they remain constrained by insufficient multi-view spatial interaction and limited multi-frame temporal consistency. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Gaussian Splatting (ST-GS) framework to enhance both spatial and temporal modeling in existing Gaussian-based pipelines. Specifically, we develop a guidance-informed spatial aggregation strategy within a dual-mode attention mechanism to strengthen spatial interaction in Gaussian representations. Furthermore, we introduce a geometry-aware temporal fusion scheme that effectively leverages historical context to improve temporal continuity in scene completion. Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes occupancy prediction benchmark showcase that our proposed approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also delivers markedly better temporal consistency compared to existing Gaussian-based methods.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformer (ViT) based autoencoders often underutilize the global Class token and employ static attention mechanisms, limiting both generative control and optimization efficiency. This paper introduces ViTCAE, a framework that addresses these issues by re-purposing the Class token into a generative linchpin. In our architecture, the encoder maps the Class token to a global latent variable that dictates the prior distribution for local, patch-level latent variables, establishing a robust dependency where global semantics directly inform the synthesis of local details. Drawing inspiration from opinion dynamics, we treat each attention head as a dynamical system of interacting tokens seeking consensus. This perspective motivates a convergence-aware temperature scheduler that adaptively anneals each head's influence function based on its distributional stability. This process enables a principled head-freezing mechanism, guided by theoretically-grounded diagnostics like an attention evolution distance and a consensus/cluster functional. This technique prunes converged heads during training to significantly improve computational efficiency without sacrificing fidelity. By unifying a generative Class token with an adaptive attention mechanism rooted in multi-agent consensus theory, ViTCAE offers a more efficient and controllable approach to transformer-based generation.

- **Summary**: Human-Object Interaction Recognition (HOIR) and user identification play a crucial role in advancing augmented reality (AR)-based personalized assistive technologies. These systems are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes, human-centric environments such as aircraft cockpits, aerospace maintenance, and surgical procedures. This research introduces I2S (Interact2Sign), a multi stage framework designed for unobtrusive user identification through human object interaction recognition, leveraging 3D hand pose analysis in egocentric videos. I2S utilizes handcrafted features extracted from 3D hand poses and per forms sequential feature augmentation: first identifying the object class, followed by HOI recognition, and ultimately, user identification. A comprehensive feature extraction and description process was carried out for 3D hand poses, organizing the extracted features into semantically meaningful categories: Spatial, Frequency, Kinematic, Orientation, and a novel descriptor introduced in this work, the Inter-Hand Spatial Envelope (IHSE). Extensive ablation studies were conducted to determine the most effective combination of features. The optimal configuration achieved an impressive average F1-score of 97.52% for user identification, evaluated on a bimanual object manipulation dataset derived from the ARCTIC and H2O datasets. I2S demonstrates state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a lightweight model size of under 4 MB and a fast inference time of 0.1 seconds. These characteristics make the proposed framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device authentication in security-critical, AR-based systems.

- **Summary**: In text-video retrieval, auxiliary captions are often used to enhance video understanding, bridging the gap between the modalities. While recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot caption generation, we observe that such captions tend to be generic and indistinguishable across visually similar videos, limiting their utility for fine-grained retrieval. Moreover, conventional captioning approaches are typically evaluated using language generation metrics, such as BLEU, which are not typically tailored for retrieval tasks that require making discriminative distinctions between candidates. To address this, we propose $\textbf{CaRe-DPO}$, a retrieval framework that directly optimizes caption generation using retrieval relevance scores. At its core is Dual-Group Direct Preference Optimization (DG-DPO), a novel learning strategy that supervises captioning by modeling preferences across groups of distinct video and caption pairs. In addition, we present an MLLM-based retrieval model that incorporates role-embeddings to better distinguish between textual inputs with different functional roles, such as an auxiliary caption and a text query. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CaRe-DPO significantly enhances retrieval performance by effectively leveraging auxiliary knowledge to generate fine-grained captions for retrieval.

- **Summary**: Recent black-box counterfactual generation frameworks fail to take into account the semantic content of the proposed edits, while relying heavily on training to guide the generation process. We propose a novel, plug-and-play black-box counterfactual generation framework, which suggests step-by-step edits based on theoretical guarantees of optimal edits to produce human-level counterfactual explanations with zero training. Our framework utilizes a pre-trained image editing diffusion model, and operates without access to the internals of the classifier, leading to an explainable counterfactual generation process. Throughout our experimentation, we showcase the explanatory gap between human reasoning and neural model behavior by utilizing both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Vision Transformer (ViT) and Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) classifiers, substantiated through a comprehensive human evaluation.

- **Summary**: Bearing fault diagnosis in rotating machinery is critical for ensuring operational reliability, therefore early fault detection is essential to avoid catastrophic failures and expensive emergency repairs. Traditional methods like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) often fail to capture the complex, non-stationary nature of vibration signals. This study leverages the cyclostationary properties of vibration data through Spectral Correlation Density (SCD) images to enhance fault detection and apply deep learning for classification. Using a publicly available dataset with bearing faults seeded in two distinct housings (A and B) under varying load conditions (0 Nm, 2 Nm, 4 Nm), we processed vibration signals into 2D SCD images to reveal fault-specific periodicities, such as broadband spectra (2000--8000 Hz) for larger faults. Three convolutional neural network (CNN) models, Custom CNN, ResNet152V2, and EfficientNetB0, were developed to classify seven bearing conditions. The custom CNN achieved the highest accuracies of 96.58\% and 94.95\% on Housing A and B, respectively, followed by ResNet152V2 at 96.49\% and 95.35\%, and EfficientNetB0 at 94.16\% and 91.65\%, respectively. The models' high accuracies across different housings demonstrate a robust solution suitable for cost-effective condition monitoring deployable near sensing platforms, contributing to applied machine learning for edge intelligence and showcasing effective signal processing strategies for handling complex, potentially large-scale vibration data.

- **Summary**: Deep generative models have emerged as a transformative tool in medical imaging, offering substantial potential for synthetic data generation. However, recent empirical studies highlight a critical vulnerability: these models can memorize sensitive training data, posing significant risks of unauthorized patient information disclosure. Detecting memorization in generative models remains particularly challenging, necessitating scalable methods capable of identifying training data leakage across large sets of generated samples. In this work, we propose DeepSSIM, a novel self-supervised metric for quantifying memorization in generative models. DeepSSIM is trained to: i) project images into a learned embedding space and ii) force the cosine similarity between embeddings to match the ground-truth SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) scores computed in the image space. To capture domain-specific anatomical features, training incorporates structure-preserving augmentations, allowing DeepSSIM to estimate similarity reliably without requiring precise spatial alignment. We evaluate DeepSSIM in a case study involving synthetic brain MRI data generated by a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) trained under memorization-prone conditions, using 2,195 MRI scans from two publicly available datasets (IXI and CoRR). Compared to state-of-the-art memorization metrics, DeepSSIM achieves superior performance, improving F1 scores by an average of +52.03% over the best existing method. Code and data of our approach are publicly available at the following link: https://github.com/brAIn-science/DeepSSIM.

- **Summary**: Sparse Perception Models (SPMs) adopt a query-driven paradigm that forgoes explicit dense BEV or volumetric construction, enabling highly efficient computation and accelerated inference. In this paper, we introduce SQS, a novel query-based splatting pre-training specifically designed to advance SPMs in autonomous driving. SQS introduces a plug-in module that predicts 3D Gaussian representations from sparse queries during pre-training, leveraging self-supervised splatting to learn fine-grained contextual features through the reconstruction of multi-view images and depth maps. During fine-tuning, the pre-trained Gaussian queries are seamlessly integrated into downstream networks via query interaction mechanisms that explicitly connect pre-trained queries with task-specific queries, effectively accommodating the diverse requirements of occupancy prediction and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that SQS delivers considerable performance gains across multiple query-based 3D perception tasks, notably in occupancy prediction and 3D object detection, outperforming prior state-of-the-art pre-training approaches by a significant margin (i.e., +1.3 mIoU on occupancy prediction and +1.0 NDS on 3D detection).

- **Summary**: Multi-step or hybrid deepfakes, created by sequentially applying different deepfake creation methods such as Face-Swapping, GAN-based generation, and Diffusion methods, can pose an emerging and unforseen technical challenge for detection models trained on single-step forgeries. While prior studies have mainly focused on detecting isolated single manipulation, little is known about the detection model behavior under such compositional, hybrid, and complex manipulation pipelines. In this work, we introduce \textbf{FakeChain}, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1-, 2-, and 3-Step forgeries synthesized using five state-of-the-art representative generators. Using this approach, we analyze detection performance and spectral properties across hybrid manipulation at different step, along with varying generator combinations and quality settings. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that detection performance highly depends on the final manipulation type, with F1-score dropping by up to \textbf{58.83\%} when it differs from training distribution. This clearly demonstrates that detectors rely on last-stage artifacts rather than cumulative manipulation traces, limiting generalization. Such findings highlight the need for detection models to explicitly consider manipulation history and sequences. Our results highlight the importance of benchmarks such as FakeChain, reflecting growing synthesis complexity and diversity in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Accurately assessing image complexity (IC) is critical for computer vision, yet most existing methods rely solely on visual features and often neglect high-level semantic information, limiting their accuracy and generalization. We introduce vision-text fusion for IC modeling. This approach integrates visual and textual semantic features, increasing representational diversity. It also reduces the complexity of the hypothesis space, which enhances both accuracy and generalization in complexity assessment. We propose the D2S (Describe-to-Score) framework, which generates image captions with a pre-trained vision-language model. We propose the feature alignment and entropy distribution alignment mechanisms, D2S guides semantic information to inform complexity assessment while bridging the gap between vision and text modalities. D2S utilizes multi-modal information during training but requires only the vision branch during inference, thereby avoiding multi-modal computational overhead and enabling efficient assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that D2S outperforms existing methods on the IC9600 dataset and maintains competitiveness on no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) benchmark, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-modal fusion in complexity-related tasks.

- **Summary**: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans, cities require detailed air temperature data. However, predictive analytics methods based on conventional machine learning models and limited data infrastructure often provide inaccurate predictions, especially in underserved areas. In this context, geospatial foundation models trained on unstructured global data demonstrate strong generalization and require minimal fine-tuning, offering an alternative for predictions where traditional approaches are limited. This study fine-tunes a geospatial foundation model to predict urban land surface temperatures under future climate scenarios and explores its response to land cover changes using simulated vegetation strategies. The fine-tuned model achieved pixel-wise downscaling errors below 1.74 {\deg}C and aligned with ground truth patterns, demonstrating an extrapolation capacity up to 3.62 {\deg}C.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Visual Question Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA) has gained significant attention for its potential to assist medical students and junior doctors in understanding surgical scenes. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided more promising solutions for this task. However, current methods struggle to establish complex dependencies between text and visual details, and have difficulty perceiving the spatial information of surgical scenes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, Surgical-MambaLLM, which is the first to combine Mamba2 with LLM in the surgical domain, that leverages Mamba2's ability to effectively capture cross-modal dependencies and perceive spatial information in surgical scenes, thereby enhancing the LLMs' understanding of surgical images. Specifically, we propose the Cross-modal Bidirectional Mamba2 Integration (CBMI) module to leverage Mamba2 for effective multimodal fusion, with its cross-modal integration capabilities. Additionally, tailored to the geometric characteristics of surgical scenes, we design the Surgical Instrument Perception (SIP) scanning mode for Mamba2 to scan the surgical images, enhancing the model's spatial understanding of the surgical scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Surgical-MambaLLM model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the EndoVis17-VQLA and EndoVis18-VQLA datasets, significantly improving the performance of the Surgical-VQLA task.

- **Summary**: Skeleton-based gait emotion recognition has received significant attention due to its wide-ranging applications. However, existing methods primarily focus on extracting spatial and local temporal motion information, failing to capture long-range temporal representations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CGTGait}, a novel framework that collaboratively integrates graph convolution and transformers to extract discriminative spatiotemporal features for gait emotion recognition. Specifically, CGTGait consists of multiple CGT blocks, where each block employs graph convolution to capture frame-level spatial topology and the transformer to model global temporal dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a Bidirectional Cross-Stream Fusion (BCSF) module to effectively aggregate posture and motion spatiotemporal features, facilitating the exchange of complementary information between the two streams. We evaluate our method on two widely used datasets, Emotion-Gait and ELMD, demonstrating that our CGTGait achieves state-of-the-art or at least competitive performance while reducing computational complexity by approximately \textbf{82.2\%} (only requiring 0.34G FLOPs) during testing.

- **Summary**: In this study, we introduce Vision-Caption aware Supervised FineTuning (VCASFT), a novel learning paradigm designed to enhance the performance of smaller Vision Language Models(VLMs) on scientific visual question answering(VQA) tasks. VCASFT leverages image captions as zero-shot prompts alongside question-answer pairs and instruction-tunes models to yield significant performance improvements. To comprehensively evaluate VCASFT, we benchmark it on ScienceQA, which consists of questions across diverse languages, subjects, and fields, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness in a variety of educational contexts. Additionally, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique on lowresource languages, we developed HiSciVQA, a dataset comprising 2,245 high-quality, hand-annotated Hindi multimodal Q&A pairs. This dataset addresses the critical need for low-resource language Q&A datasets and serves as a foundation for testing VCASFT. Additionally, we introduce a novel LLM-based evaluation scheme to evaluate VLMs on HiSciVQA which offers deeper insights into model effectiveness surpassing traditional n-gram matching accuracy metrics. We are committed to advancing the field by open-sourcing all code files and the HiSciVQA dataset for the research community.

- **Summary**: We present Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster, an efficient diffusion-based framework for freestyle portrait animation driven by facial landmarks. The main challenges in this task are preserving the identity of the reference portrait, accurately transferring target expressions, and maintaining long-term temporal consistency while ensuring generation efficiency. To address identity preservation and accurate expression retargeting, we enhance Stable Diffusion with two key components: a expression-aware landmarks as explicit motion signals, which improve motion alignment, support exaggerated expressions, and reduce identity leakage; and a fine-grained facial loss that leverages both expression and facial masks to better capture subtle expressions and faithfully preserve the reference appearance. With these components, our model supports controllable and expressive animation across diverse portrait types, including real faces, cartoons, sculptures, and animals. However, diffusion-based frameworks typically struggle to efficiently generate long-term stable animation results, which remains a core challenge in this task. To address this, we propose a progressive generation strategy for stable long-term animation, and introduce a Taylor-interpolated cache, achieving a 2.6X lossless acceleration. These two strategies ensure that our method produces high-quality results efficiently, making it user-friendly and accessible. Finally, we introduce EmojiBench++, a more comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse portraits, driving videos, and landmark sequences. Extensive evaluations on EmojiBench++ demonstrate that Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster achieves superior performance in both animation quality and controllability. The code, training dataset and benchmark will be found in https://follow-your-emoji.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Few-shot font generation aims to create new fonts with a limited number of glyph references. It can be used to significantly reduce the labor cost of manual font design. However, due to the variety and complexity of font styles, the results generated by existing methods often suffer from visible defects, such as stroke errors, artifacts and blurriness. To address these issues, we propose DA-Font, a novel framework which integrates a Dual-Attention Hybrid Module (DAHM). Specifically, we introduce two synergistic attention blocks: the component attention block that leverages component information from content images to guide the style transfer process, and the relation attention block that further refines spatial relationships through interacting the content feature with both original and stylized component-wise representations. These two blocks collaborate to preserve accurate character shapes and stylistic textures. Moreover, we also design a corner consistency loss and an elastic mesh feature loss to better improve geometric alignment. Extensive experiments show that our DA-Font outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across diverse font styles and characters, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing structural integrity and local fidelity.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (L-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various vision and language tasks, including visual question answering (VQA). However, their high computational cost makes them impractical for resource-constrained settings and inference-heavy applications. In contrast, Small Vision-Language Models (S-VLMs) offer efficiency but suffer from a significant performance gap compared to their larger counterparts. In this work, we introduce the Model Parity Aligner (MPA), a novel framework designed to systematically improve S-VLMs by leveraging unlabeled images and effective knowledge transfer from L-VLMs. Instead of traditional knowledge distillation methods that rely on labeled training data, MPA employs a strategic parity-based approach that precisely identifies the knowledge disparities between S-VLMs and L-VLMs, and optimizes training by targeting only these disparities. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse VQA benchmarks, namely TextVQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, and OKVQA, each of which requires specialized reasoning capabilities such as text recognition, chart interpretation, and commonsense and factual understanding. Our results demonstrate that MPA consistently enhances the performance of S-VLMs on all benchmarks, reducing the performance gap while maintaining computational efficiency. We make our code publicly available.

- **Summary**: In real applications, person re-identification (ReID) is expected to retrieve the target person at any time, including both daytime and nighttime, ranging from short-term to long-term. However, existing ReID tasks and datasets can not meet this requirement, as they are constrained by available time and only provide training and evaluation for specific scenarios. Therefore, we investigate a new task called Anytime Person Re-identification (AT-ReID), which aims to achieve effective retrieval in multiple scenarios based on variations in time. To address the AT-ReID problem, we collect the first large-scale dataset, AT-USTC, which contains 403k images of individuals wearing multiple clothes captured by RGB and IR cameras. Our data collection spans 21 months, and 270 volunteers were photographed on average 29.1 times across different dates or scenes, 4-15 times more than current datasets, providing conditions for follow-up investigations in AT-ReID. Further, to tackle the new challenge of multi-scenario retrieval, we propose a unified model named Uni-AT, which comprises a multi-scenario ReID (MS-ReID) framework for scenario-specific features learning, a Mixture-of-Attribute-Experts (MoAE) module to alleviate inter-scenario interference, and a Hierarchical Dynamic Weighting (HDW) strategy to ensure balanced training across all scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our model leads to satisfactory results and exhibits excellent generalization to all scenarios.

- **Summary**: Point cloud analysis has evolved with diverse network architectures, while existing works predominantly focus on introducing novel structural designs. However, conventional point-based architectures - processing raw points through sequential sampling, grouping, and feature extraction layers - demonstrate underutilized potential. We notice that substantial performance gains can be unlocked through strategic module integration rather than structural modifications. In this paper, we propose the Grouping-Feature Coordination Module (GF-Core), a lightweight separable component that simultaneously regulates both grouping layer and feature extraction layer to enable more nuanced feature aggregation. Besides, we introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy specifically tailored for point-based inputs to enhance model robustness in complex point cloud analysis scenarios. On ModelNet40 dataset, our method elevates baseline networks to 94.0% accuracy, matching advanced frameworks' performance while preserving architectural simplicity. On three variants of the ScanObjectNN dataset, we obtain improvements of 2.96%, 6.34%, and 6.32% respectively.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their strong reasoning and planning capabilities, are widely used in embodied decision-making (EDM) tasks in embodied agents, such as autonomous driving and robotic manipulation. Recent research has increasingly explored adversarial attacks on VLMs to reveal their vulnerabilities. However, these attacks either rely on overly strong assumptions, requiring full knowledge of the victim VLM, which is impractical for attacking VLM-based agents, or exhibit limited effectiveness. The latter stems from disrupting most semantic information in the image, which leads to a misalignment between the perception and the task context defined by system prompts. This inconsistency interrupts the VLM's reasoning process, resulting in invalid outputs that fail to affect interactions in the physical world. To this end, we propose a fine-grained adversarial attack framework, ADVEDM, which modifies the VLM's perception of only a few key objects while preserving the semantics of the remaining regions. This attack effectively reduces conflicts with the task context, making VLMs output valid but incorrect decisions and affecting the actions of agents, thus posing a more substantial safety threat in the physical world. We design two variants of based on this framework, ADVEDM-R and ADVEDM-A, which respectively remove the semantics of a specific object from the image and add the semantics of a new object into the image. The experimental results in both general scenarios and EDM tasks demonstrate fine-grained control and excellent attack performance.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning, yet their applications in autonomous driving remain limited. In particular, the ability to understand road topology, a key requirement for safe navigation, has received relatively little attention. While some recent works have begun to explore VLMs in driving contexts, their performance on topology reasoning is far from satisfactory. In this work, we systematically evaluate VLMs' capabilities in road topology understanding. Specifically, multi-view images are projected into unified ground-plane coordinate system and fused into bird's-eye-view (BEV) lanes. Based on these BEV lanes, we formulate four topology-related diagnostic VQA tasks, which together capture essential components of spatial topology reasoning. Through extensive evaluation, we find that while frontier closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve relatively high accuracy in some tasks, they still fail in some temporal questions that humans can answer (e.g., GPT-4o achieve only 67.8% in vector, a two-class classification problem). Furthermore, we find open-source VLMs, even at 30B scale, struggle significantly. These results indicate that spatial reasoning remains a fundamental bottleneck for current VLMs. We also find that the model's capability is positively correlated with model size, length of reasoning tokens and shots provided as examples, showing direction for future research.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) is drawing increasing interest for its ability to minimize manual annotation requirements while enhancing semantic understanding in downstream tasks. However, its reliance on image-text datasets poses challenges due to privacy concerns and the high cost of obtaining paired annotations. Data augmentation emerges as a viable strategy to address this issue, yet existing methods often fall short of capturing the subtle and complex variations in medical data due to limited diversity. To this end, we propose MedCutMix, a novel multi-modal disease-centric data augmentation method. MedCutMix performs diagnostic sentence CutMix within medical reports and establishes the cross-attention between the diagnostic sentence and medical image to guide attentive manifold mix within the imaging modality. Our approach surpasses previous methods across four downstream radiology diagnosis datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing performance and generalizability in radiology VLP.

- **Summary**: Text-based Pedestrian Retrieval (TPR) aims to retrieve specific target pedestrians in visual scenes according to natural language descriptions. Although existing methods have achieved progress under constrained settings, interactive retrieval in the open-world scenario still suffers from limited model generalization and insufficient semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we propose FitPro, an open-world interactive zero-shot TPR framework with enhanced semantic comprehension and cross-scene adaptability. FitPro has three innovative components: Feature Contrastive Decoding (FCD), Incremental Semantic Mining (ISM), and Query-aware Hierarchical Retrieval (QHR). The FCD integrates prompt-guided contrastive decoding to generate high-quality structured pedestrian descriptions from denoised images, effectively alleviating semantic drift in zero-shot scenarios. The ISM constructs holistic pedestrian representations from multi-view observations to achieve global semantic modeling in multi-turn interactions,thereby improving robustness against viewpoint shifts and fine-grained variations in descriptions. The QHR dynamically optimizes the retrieval pipeline according to query types, enabling efficient adaptation to multi-modal and multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments on five public datasets and two evaluation protocols demonstrate that FitPro significantly overcomes the generalization limitations and semantic modeling constraints of existing methods in interactive retrieval, paving the way for practical deployment. The code and data will be released at https://github.com/ lilo4096/FitPro-Interactive-Person-Retrieval.

- **Summary**: Embodied intelligence relies on accurately segmenting objects actively involved in interactions. Action-based video object segmentation addresses this by linking segmentation with action semantics, but it depends on large-scale annotations and prompts that are costly, inconsistent, and prone to multimodal noise such as imprecise masks and referential ambiguity. To date, this challenge remains unexplored. In this work, we take the first step by studying action-based video object segmentation under label noise, focusing on two sources: textual prompt noise (category flips and within-category noun substitutions) and mask annotation noise (perturbed object boundaries to mimic imprecise supervision). Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce two types of label noises for the action-based video object segmentation task. Second, we build up the first action-based video object segmentation under a label noise benchmark ActiSeg-NL and adapt six label-noise learning strategies to this setting, and establish protocols for evaluating them under textual, boundary, and mixed noise. Third, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking noise types to failure modes and robustness gains, and we introduce a Parallel Mask Head Mechanism (PMHM) to address mask annotation noise. Qualitative evaluations further reveal characteristic failure modes, including boundary leakage and mislocalization under boundary perturbations, as well as occasional identity substitutions under textual flips. Our comparative analysis reveals that different learning strategies exhibit distinct robustness profiles, governed by a foreground-background trade-off where some achieve balanced performance while others prioritize foreground accuracy at the cost of background precision. The established benchmark and source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/mylwx/ActiSeg-NL.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation is widely utilized as an effective technique to enhance the generalization performance of deep models. However, data augmentation may inevitably introduce distribution shifts and noises, which significantly constrain the potential and deteriorate the performance of deep networks. To this end, we propose a novel information-preserving framework, namely IPF-RDA, to enhance the robustness of data augmentations in this paper. IPF-RDA combines the proposal of (i) a new class-discriminative information estimation algorithm that identifies the points most vulnerable to data augmentation operations and corresponding importance scores; And (ii) a new information-preserving scheme that preserves the critical information in the augmented samples and ensures the diversity of augmented data adaptively. We divide data augmentation methods into three categories according to the operation types and integrate these approaches into our framework accordingly. After being integrated into our framework, the robustness of data augmentation methods can be enhanced and their full potential can be unleashed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that although being simple, IPF-RDA consistently improves the performance of numerous commonly used state-of-the-art data augmentation methods with popular deep models on a variety of datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, CUHK03, Market1501, Oxford Flower, and MNIST, where its performance and scalability are stressed.

- **Summary**: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is increasingly used in diverse applications ranging from general visual reasoning to safety-critical domains such as medical imaging and autonomous systems, where models must provide not only accurate answers but also explanations that humans can easily understand and verify. Prototype-based modeling has shown promise for interpretability by grounding predictions in semantically meaningful regions for purely visual reasoning tasks, yet remains underexplored in the context of VQA. We present ProtoVQA, a unified prototypical framework that (i) learns question-aware prototypes that serve as reasoning anchors, connecting answers to discriminative image regions, (ii) applies spatially constrained matching to ensure that the selected evidence is coherent and semantically relevant, and (iii) supports both answering and grounding tasks through a shared prototype backbone. To assess explanation quality, we propose the Visual-Linguistic Alignment Score (VLAS), which measures how well the model's attended regions align with ground-truth evidence. Experiments on Visual7W show that ProtoVQA yields faithful, fine-grained explanations while maintaining competitive accuracy, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy VQA systems.

- **Summary**: Multi-view crowd counting and localization fuse the input multi-views for estimating the crowd number or locations on the ground. Existing methods mainly focus on accurately predicting on the crowd shown in the input views, which neglects the problem of choosing the `best' camera views to perceive all crowds well in the scene. Besides, existing view selection methods require massive labeled views and images, and lack the ability for cross-scene settings, reducing their application scenarios. Thus, in this paper, we study the view selection issue for better scene-level multi-view crowd counting and localization results with cross-scene ability and limited label demand, instead of input-view-level results. We first propose an independent view selection method (IVS) that considers view and scene geometries in the view selection strategy and conducts the view selection, labeling, and downstream tasks independently. Based on IVS, we also put forward an active view selection method (AVS) that jointly optimizes the view selection, labeling, and downstream tasks. In AVS, we actively select the labeled views and consider both the view/scene geometries and the predictions of the downstream task models in the view selection process. Experiments on multi-view counting and localization tasks demonstrate the cross-scene and the limited label demand advantages of the proposed active view selection method (AVS), outperforming existing methods and with wider application scenarios.

- **Summary**: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medicine is remarkable, offering advanced diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. However, the inherent opacity of complex AI models presents significant challenges to their clinical practicality. This paper focuses primarily on investigating the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, with the aim of making AI decisions transparent and interpretable. Our research focuses on implementing simulations using various medical datasets to elucidate the internal workings of the XAI model. These dataset-driven simulations demonstrate how XAI effectively interprets AI predictions, thus improving the decision-making process for healthcare professionals. In addition to a survey of the main XAI methods and simulations, ongoing challenges in the XAI field are discussed. The study highlights the need for the continuous development and exploration of XAI, particularly from the perspective of diverse medical datasets, to promote its adoption and effectiveness in the healthcare domain.

- **Summary**: In coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI), the captured measurement entangles spatial and spectral information, posing a severely ill-posed inverse problem for hyperspectral images (HSIs) reconstruction. Moreover, the captured radiance inherently depends on scene illumination, making it difficult to recover the intrinsic spectral reflectance that remains invariant to lighting conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a chromaticity-intensity decomposition framework, which disentangles an HSI into a spatially smooth intensity map and a spectrally variant chromaticity cube. The chromaticity encodes lighting-invariant reflectance, enriched with high-frequency spatial details and local spectral sparsity. Building on this decomposition, we develop CIDNet, a Chromaticity-Intensity Decomposition unfolding network within a dual-camera CASSI system. CIDNet integrates a hybrid spatial-spectral Transformer tailored to reconstruct fine-grained and sparse spectral chromaticity and a degradation-aware, spatially-adaptive noise estimation module that captures anisotropic noise across iterative stages. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world CASSI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both spectral and chromaticity fidelity. Code and models will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images. Recent advancements in Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation have leveraged positional conditions and textual descriptions to facilitate precise and controllable image synthesis. Despite overall progress, current L2I methods still exhibit suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose InstanceAssemble, a novel architecture that incorporates layout conditions via instance-assembling attention, enabling position control with bounding boxes (bbox) and multimodal content control including texts and additional visual content. Our method achieves flexible adaption to existing DiT-based T2I models through light-weighted LoRA modules. Additionally, we propose a Layout-to-Image benchmark, Denselayout, a comprehensive benchmark for layout-to-image generation, containing 5k images with 90k instances in total. We further introduce Layout Grounding Score (LGS), an interpretable evaluation metric to more precisely assess the accuracy of L2I generation. Experiments demonstrate that our InstanceAssemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance under complex layout conditions, while exhibiting strong compatibility with diverse style LoRA modules.

- **Summary**: Personalized animal image generation is challenging due to rich appearance cues and large morphological variability. Existing approaches often exhibit feature misalignment across domains, which leads to identity drift. We present AnimalBooth, a framework that strengthens identity preservation with an Animal Net and an adaptive attention module, mitigating cross domain alignment errors. We further introduce a frequency controlled feature integration module that applies Discrete Cosine Transform filtering in the latent space to guide the diffusion process, enabling a coarse to fine progression from global structure to detailed texture. To advance research in this area, we curate AnimalBench, a high resolution dataset for animal personalization. Extensive experiments show that AnimalBooth consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple benchmarks and improves both identity fidelity and perceptual quality.

- **Summary**: While significant advances exist in pseudo-label generation for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, pseudo-label selection remains understudied. Existing methods typically use fixed confidence thresholds to retain high-confidence predictions as pseudo-labels. However, these methods cannot cope with network overconfidence tendency, where correct and incorrect predictions overlap significantly in high-confidence regions, making separation challenging and amplifying model cognitive bias. Meanwhile, the direct discarding of low-confidence predictions disrupts spatial-semantic continuity, causing critical context loss. We propose Confidence Separable Learning (CSL) to address these limitations. CSL formulates pseudo-label selection as a convex optimization problem within the confidence distribution feature space, establishing sample-specific decision boundaries to distinguish reliable from unreliable predictions. Additionally, CSL introduces random masking of reliable pixels to guide the network in learning contextual relationships from low-reliability regions, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of discarding uncertain predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Pascal, Cityscapes, and COCO benchmarks show that CSL performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Enabling agents to understand and interact with complex 3D scenes is a fundamental challenge for embodied artificial intelligence systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in 2D image understanding, extending such capabilities to 3D scenes remains difficult: 1) 3D environment involves richer concepts such as spatial relationships, affordances, physics, layout, and so on, 2) the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language datasets has posed a significant obstacle. In this paper, we introduce Text-Scene, a framework that automatically parses 3D scenes into textual descriptions for scene understanding. Given a 3D scene, our model identifies object attributes and spatial relationships, and then generates a coherent summary of the whole scene, bridging the gap between 3D observation and language without requiring human-in-the-loop intervention. By leveraging both geometric analysis and MLLMs, Text-Scene produces descriptions that are accurate, detailed, and human-interpretable, capturing object-level details and global-level context. Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate that our textual parses can faithfully represent 3D scenes and benefit downstream tasks. To evaluate the reasoning capability of MLLMs, we present InPlan3D, a comprehensive benchmark for 3D task planning, consisting of 3174 long-term planning tasks across 636 indoor scenes. We emphasize clarity and accessibility in our approach, aiming to make 3D scene content understandable through language. Code and datasets will be released.

- **Summary**: Automated pain assessment from facial expressions is crucial for non-communicative patients, such as those with dementia. Progress has been limited by two challenges: (i) existing datasets exhibit severe demographic and label imbalance due to ethical constraints, and (ii) current generative models cannot precisely control facial action units (AUs), facial structure, or clinically validated pain levels.   We present 3DPain, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for automated pain assessment, featuring unprecedented annotation richness and demographic diversity. Our three-stage framework generates diverse 3D meshes, textures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to synthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU configurations, PSPI scores, and the first dataset-level annotations of pain-region heatmaps. The dataset comprises 82,500 samples across 25,000 pain expression heatmaps and 2,500 synthetic identities balanced by age, gender, and ethnicity.   We further introduce ViTPain, a Vision Transformer based cross-modal distillation framework in which a heatmap-trained teacher guides a student trained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical reliability. Together, 3DPain and ViTPain establish a controllable, diverse, and clinically grounded foundation for generalizable automated pain assessment.

- **Summary**: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continuously learn new categories while retaining the knowledge of old ones. Pre-trained models (PTMs) show promising capabilities in CIL. However, existing approaches that apply lightweight fine-tuning to backbones still induce parameter drift, thereby compromising the generalization capability of pre-trained models. Parameter drift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns learned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is not always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned from pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing appropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a margin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for CIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to mitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks. Specifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of new tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture of different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the intermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves state-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly outstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings. This shows the significant potential for beneficial noise in continual learning. Code is available at https://github.com/ASCIIJK/MiN-NeurIPS2025.

CAMBench-QR synthesizes QR/non-QR data with exact masks and controlled distortions, and reports structure-aware metrics (Finder/Timing Mass Ratios, Background Leakage, coverage AUCs, Distance-to-Structure) alongside causal occlusion, insertion/deletion faithfulness, robustness, and latency. We benchmark representative, efficient CAMs (LayerCAM, EigenGrad-CAM, XGrad-CAM) under two practical regimes of zero-shot and last-block fine-tuning. The benchmark, metrics, and training recipes provide a simple, reproducible yardstick for structure-aware evaluation of visual explanations. Hence we propose that CAMBENCH-QR can be used as a litmus test of whether visual explanations are truly structure-aware.

- **Summary**: Tri-plane-like representations have been widely adopted in 3D-aware GANs for head image synthesis and other 3D object/scene modeling tasks due to their efficiency. However, querying features via Cartesian coordinate projection often leads to feature entanglement, which results in mirroring artifacts. A recent work, SphereHead, attempted to address this issue by introducing spherical tri-planes based on a spherical coordinate system. While it successfully mitigates feature entanglement, SphereHead suffers from uneven mapping between the square feature maps and the spherical planes, leading to inefficient feature map utilization during rendering and difficulties in generating fine image details. Moreover, both tri-plane and spherical tri-plane representations share a subtle yet persistent issue: feature penetration across convolutional channels can cause interference between planes, particularly when one plane dominates the others. These challenges collectively prevent tri-plane-based methods from reaching their full potential. In this paper, we systematically analyze these problems for the first time and propose innovative solutions to address them. Specifically, we introduce a novel hybrid-plane (hy-plane for short) representation that combines the strengths of both planar and spherical planes while avoiding their respective drawbacks. We further enhance the spherical plane by replacing the conventional theta-phi warping with a novel near-equal-area warping strategy, which maximizes the effective utilization of the square feature map. In addition, our generator synthesizes a single-channel unified feature map instead of multiple feature maps in separate channels, thereby effectively eliminating feature penetration. With a series of technical improvements, our hy-plane representation enables our method, HyPlaneHead, to achieve state-of-the-art performance in full-head image synthesis.

- **Summary**: Numerous models have been developed for scanpath and saliency prediction, which are typically trained on scanpaths, which model eye movement as a sequence of discrete fixation points connected by saccades, while the rich information contained in the raw trajectories is often discarded. Moreover, most existing approaches fail to capture the variability observed among human subjects viewing the same image. They generally predict a single scanpath of fixed, pre-defined length, which conflicts with the inherent diversity and stochastic nature of real-world visual attention. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEye, a diffusion-based training framework designed to model continuous and diverse eye movement trajectories during free viewing of natural images. Our method builds on a diffusion model conditioned on visual stimuli and introduces a novel component, namely Corresponding Positional Embedding (CPE), which aligns spatial gaze information with the patch-based semantic features of the visual input. By leveraging raw eye-tracking trajectories rather than relying on scanpaths, DiffEye captures the inherent variability in human gaze behavior and generates high-quality, realistic eye movement patterns, despite being trained on a comparatively small dataset. The generated trajectories can also be converted into scanpaths and saliency maps, resulting in outputs that more accurately reflect the distribution of human visual attention. DiffEye is the first method to tackle this task on natural images using a diffusion model while fully leveraging the richness of raw eye-tracking data. Our extensive evaluation shows that DiffEye not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in scanpath generation but also enables, for the first time, the generation of continuous eye movement trajectories.

- **Summary**: Generative 3D modeling has advanced rapidly, driven by applications in VR/AR, metaverse, and robotics. However, most methods represent the target object as a closed mesh devoid of any structural information, limiting editing, animation, and semantic understanding. Part-aware 3D generation addresses this problem by decomposing objects into meaningful components, but existing pipelines face challenges: in existing methods, the user has no control over which objects are separated and how model imagine the occluded parts in isolation phase. In this paper, we introduce MMPart, an innovative framework for generating part-aware 3D models from a single image. We first use a VLM to generate a set of prompts based on the input image and user descriptions. In the next step, a generative model generates isolated images of each object based on the initial image and the previous step's prompts as supervisor (which control the pose and guide model how imagine previously occluded areas). Each of those images then enters the multi-view generation stage, where a number of consistent images from different views are generated. Finally, a reconstruction model converts each of these multi-view images into a 3D model.

- **Summary**: With the rapid increase in the number of artificial satellites, astronomical imaging is experiencing growing interference. When these satellites reflect sunlight, they produce streak-like artifacts in photometry images. Such satellite trails can introduce false sources and cause significant photometric errors. As a result, accurately identifying the positions of satellite trails in observational data has become essential. In this work, we propose a satellite trail detection model that combines the U-Net deep neural network for image segmentation with the Line Segment Detector (LSD) algorithm. The model is trained on 375 simulated images of satellite trails, generated using data from the Mini-SiTian Array. Experimental results show that for trails with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3, the detection rate exceeds 99. Additionally, when applied to real observational data from the Mini-SiTian Array, the model achieves a recall of 79.57 and a precision of 74.56.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks, particularly Visual Question Answering (VQA). While prior work has explored unimodal biases in VQA, the problem of selection bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where models may favor specific option tokens (e.g., "A") or positions, remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate both the presence and nature of selection bias in LVLMs through fine-grained MCQA benchmarks spanning easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels, defined by the semantic similarity of the options. We further propose an inference-time logit-level debiasing method that estimates an ensemble bias vector from general and contextual prompts and applies confidence-adaptive corrections to the model's output. Our method mitigates bias without retraining and is compatible with frozen LVLMs. Extensive experiments across several state-of-the-art models reveal consistent selection biases that intensify with task difficulty, and show that our mitigation approach significantly reduces bias while improving accuracy in challenging settings. This work offers new insights into the limitations of LVLMs in MCQA and presents a practical approach to improve their robustness in fine-grained visual reasoning.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal three-dimensional (3D) medical imaging data, derived from ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and potentially computed tomography (CT), provide a widely adopted approach for non-invasive anatomical visualization. Accurate modeling, registration, and visualization in this setting depend on surface reconstruction and frame-to-frame interpolation. Traditional methods often face limitations due to image noise and incomplete information between frames. To address these challenges, we present MedGS, a semi-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction framework that employs a Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based interpolation mechanism. In this framework, medical imaging data are represented as consecutive two-dimensional (2D) frames embedded in 3D space and modeled using Gaussian-based distributions. This representation enables robust frame interpolation and high-fidelity surface reconstruction across imaging modalities. As a result, MedGS offers more efficient training than traditional neural implicit methods. Its explicit GS-based representation enhances noise robustness, allows flexible editing, and supports precise modeling of complex anatomical structures with fewer artifacts. These features make MedGS highly suitable for scalable and practical applications in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Machine learning is gaining significant attention as a diagnostic tool in medical imaging, particularly in the analysis of retinal fundus images. However, this approach is not yet clinically applicable, as it still depends on human validation from a professional. Therefore, we present the design for a mobile application that monitors metrics related to retinal fundus images correlating to age-related conditions. The purpose of this platform is to observe for a change in these metrics over time, offering early insights into potential ocular diseases without explicitly delivering diagnostics. Metrics analysed include vessel tortuosity, as well as signs of glaucoma, retinopathy and macular edema. To evaluate retinopathy grade and risk of macular edema, a model was trained on the Messidor dataset and compared to a similar model trained on the MAPLES-DR dataset. Information from the DeepSeeNet glaucoma detection model, as well as tortuosity calculations, is additionally incorporated to ultimately present a retinal fundus image monitoring platform. As a result, the mobile application permits monitoring of trends or changes in ocular metrics correlated to age-related conditions with regularly uploaded photographs.

- **Summary**: Counterfactual explanations (CFE) for deep image classifiers aim to reveal how minimal input changes lead to different model decisions, providing critical insights for model interpretation and improvement. However, existing CFE methods often rely on additional image encoders and generative models to create plausible images, neglecting the classifier's own feature space and decision boundaries. As such, they do not explain the intrinsic feature space and decision boundaries learned by the classifier. To address this limitation, we propose Mirror-CFE, a novel method that generates faithful counterfactual explanations by operating directly in the classifier's feature space, treating decision boundaries as mirrors that ``reflect'' feature representations in the mirror. Mirror-CFE learns a mapping function from feature space to image space while preserving distance relationships, enabling smooth transitions between source images and their counterfactuals. Through extensive experiments on four image datasets, we demonstrate that Mirror-CFE achieves superior performance in validity while maintaining input resemblance compared to state-of-the-art explanation methods. Finally, mirror-CFE provides interpretable visualization of the classifier's decision process by generating step-wise transitions that reveal how features evolve as classification confidence changes.

- **Summary**: Accurate registration between LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds and semantic 3D city models is a fundamental topic in urban digital twinning and a prerequisite for downstream tasks, such as digital construction, change detection and model refinement. However, achieving accurate LiDAR-to-Model registration at individual building level remains challenging, particularly due to the generalization uncertainty in semantic 3D city models at the Level of Detail 2 (LoD2). This paper addresses this gap by proposing L2M-Reg, a plane-based fine registration method that explicitly accounts for model uncertainty. L2M-Reg consists of three key steps: establishing reliable plane correspondence, building a pseudo-plane-constrained Gauss-Helmert model, and adaptively estimating vertical translation. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that L2M-Reg is both more accurate and computationally efficient than existing ICP-based and plane-based methods. Overall, L2M-Reg provides a novel building-level solution regarding LiDAR-to-Model registration when model uncertainty is present.

- **Summary**: Once-for-All (OFA) training enables a single super-net to generate multiple sub-nets tailored to diverse deployment scenarios, supporting flexible trade-offs among accuracy, robustness, and model-size without retraining. However, as the number of supported sub-nets increases, excessive parameter sharing in the backbone limits representational capacity, leading to degraded calibration and reduced overall performance. To address this, we propose SOLAR (Switchable Output Layer for Accuracy and Robustness in Once-for-All Training), a simple yet effective technique that assigns each sub-net a separate classification head. By decoupling the logit learning process across sub-nets, the Switchable Output Layer (SOL) reduces representational interference and improves optimization, without altering the shared backbone. We evaluate SOLAR on five datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, STL-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet) using four super-net backbones (ResNet-34, WideResNet-16-8, WideResNet-40-2, and MobileNetV2) for two OFA training frameworks (OATS and SNNs). Experiments show that SOLAR outperforms the baseline methods: compared to OATS, it improves accuracy of sub-nets up to 1.26 %, 4.71 %, 1.67 %, and 1.76 %, and robustness up to 9.01 %, 7.71 %, 2.72 %, and 1.26 % on SVHN, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and CIFAR-100, respectively. Compared to SNNs, it improves TinyImageNet accuracy by up to 2.93 %, 2.34 %, and 1.35 % using ResNet-34, WideResNet-16-8, and MobileNetV2 backbones (with 8 sub-nets), respectively.
