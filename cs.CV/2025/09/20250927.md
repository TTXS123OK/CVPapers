- **Summary**: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image, conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.

- **Summary**: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction loss.

- **Summary**: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision, point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training' (DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes, generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model. Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model without reducing the performance of clean data sets.

- **Summary**: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

- **Summary**: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function. In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

- **Summary**: Data scarcity remains a fundamental challenge in robot learning. While human demonstrations benefit from abundant motion capture data and vast internet resources, robotic manipulation suffers from limited training examples. To bridge this gap between human and robot manipulation capabilities, we propose UniPrototype, a novel framework that enables effective knowledge transfer from human to robot domains via shared motion primitives. ur approach makes three key contributions: (1) We introduce a compositional prototype discovery mechanism with soft assignments, enabling multiple primitives to co-activate and thus capture blended and hierarchical skills; (2) We propose an adaptive prototype selection strategy that automatically adjusts the number of prototypes to match task complexity, ensuring scalable and efficient representation; (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments in both simulation environments and real-world robotic systems. Our results show that UniPrototype successfully transfers human manipulation knowledge to robots, significantly improving learning efficiency and task performance compared to existing approaches.The code and dataset will be released upon acceptance at an anonymous repository.



### Copyright Infringement Detection in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Differential Privacy

- **Summary**: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy (DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning. Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

- **Summary**: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization. In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

- **Summary**: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario, outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1: 0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1: 0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability constraints.



### GeLoc3r: Enhancing Relative Camera Pose Regression with Geometric Consistency Regularization

- **Summary**: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require 300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time, maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2 dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry, achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of correspondence methods.

- **Summary**: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR) technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals. Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

- **Summary**: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model \(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i) multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation; (ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp 0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small, human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

- **Summary**: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution, existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas. This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1 percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision (BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios (e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies. Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial, frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its effectiveness in tiny object detection.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2) Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models, particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/shenytzzz/Follow-Your-Preference.

- **Summary**: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

- **Summary**: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens. Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language, \textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+ 2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in zero-shot RIS.

Performance metrics, including validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, were measured, with special emphasis on how well each architecture managed imbalanced classes.   Results: ConvNeXt achieved the highest validation accuracy at 81.06, followed by BEiT at 80.00 and Swin Transformer at 79.73, all demonstrating strong F1-scores. ViT and DeiT achieved accuracies of 79.37 and 78.79, respectively, but both struggled particularly with Caries-related classes.   Conclusions: ConvNeXt, Swin Transformer, and BEiT showed reliable diagnostic performance, making them promising candidates for clinical application in dental imaging. These findings provide guidance for model selection in future AI-driven oral disease diagnostic tools and highlight the importance of addressing data imbalance in real-world scenarios

- **Summary**: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations. We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards efficient deep learning architectures.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment. However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning, thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric, which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

- **Summary**: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality. By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across 13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks. AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc with additional alignment losses.

- **Summary**: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost. Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization. Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

- **Summary**: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is essential for rapid stroke diagnosis but is limited by low image contrast and signal to noise ratio. We address this challenge by leveraging DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision transformer, to generate powerful feature representations for a comprehensive set of stroke analysis tasks. Our evaluation encompasses infarct and hemorrhage segmentation, anomaly classification (normal vs. stroke and normal vs. infarct vs. hemorrhage), hemorrhage subtype classification (EDH, SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS classification (<=6 vs. >6) on multiple public and private datasets. This study establishes strong benchmarks for these tasks and demonstrates the potential of advanced self-supervised models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT, providing a clear analysis of both the advantages and current constraints of the approach.

- **Summary**: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent. Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle, guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core, WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module} (LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation, enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)} module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to complex weather degradations.

- **Summary**: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures. Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications. As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual human animation, and immersive entertainment.

- **Summary**: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end, video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside infrastructure.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a $+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a $-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing SAM's encoder.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations. In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the target system.

- **Summary**: To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23% point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) is a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for studying speech articulation, motor control, and related disorders. However, real-time tongue contour segmentation remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, imaging variability, and computational demands. We propose UltraUNet, a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture optimized for real-time segmentation of tongue contours in ultrasound images. UltraUNet incorporates domain-specific innovations such as lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks, Group Normalization for small-batch stability, and summation-based skip connections to reduce memory and computational overhead. It achieves 250 frames per second and integrates ultrasound-specific augmentations like denoising and blur simulation. Evaluations on 8 datasets demonstrate high accuracy and robustness, with single-dataset Dice = 0.855 and MSD = 0.993px, and cross-dataset Dice averaging 0.734 and 0.761. UltraUNet provides a fast, accurate solution for speech research, clinical diagnostics, and analysis of speech motor disorders.

- **Summary**: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer, along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect, thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge. Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses, which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER, MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

- **Summary**: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods. Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

- **Summary**: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper published in IEEE Sensors Conference 2024. The final published version is available at 10.1109/SENSORS60989.2024.10785056.

- **Summary**: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs.

- **Summary**: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare, manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40 subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all 27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

- **Summary**: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our "propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the 3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss. Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

- **Summary**: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture, relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

- **Summary**: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large (Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

- **Summary**: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against misuse of I2V generation models.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/irissun9602/Defocus-Deepfake-Detection

- **Summary**: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution, shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras, spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction methods to become perceptible to the human eye.   However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work, we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval (ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature fusion module during the generation process.   Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of Diff-SPK.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However, pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

- **Summary**: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$ AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$ mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness and diversity evaluations.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network (BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution (S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can attain a promising performance.

- **Summary**: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning, strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial improvement in reasoning fidelity.

- **Summary**: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer. Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected robustness.

- **Summary**: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become the de facto standard for modeling the human visual system, primarily due to their success in predicting neural responses. However, with many models now achieving similar predictive accuracy, we need a stronger criterion. Here, we use small-scale adversarial probes to characterize the local representational geometry of many highly predictive ANN-based brain models. We report four key findings. First, we show that most contemporary ANN-based brain models are unexpectedly fragile. Despite high prediction scores, their response predictions are highly sensitive to small, imperceptible perturbations, revealing unreliable local coding directions. Second, we demonstrate that a model's sensitivity to adversarial probes can better discriminate between candidate neural encoding models than prediction accuracy alone. Third, we find that standard models rely on distinct local coding directions that do not transfer across model architectures. Finally, we show that adversarial probes from robustified models produce generalizable and semantically meaningful changes, suggesting that they capture the local coding dimensions of the visual system. Together, our work shows that local representational geometry provides a stronger criterion for brain model evaluation. We also provide empirical grounds for favoring robust models, whose more stable coding axes not only align better with neural selectivity but also generate concrete, testable predictions for future experiments.

- **Summary**: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10 benchmark.

- **Summary**: Simplified proxy models are commonly used to represent architectural structures, reducing storage requirements and enabling real-time rendering. However, the geometric simplifications inherent in proxies result in a loss of fine color and geometric details, making it essential for textures to compensate for the loss. Preserving the rich texture information from the original dense architectural reconstructions remains a daunting task, particularly when working with unordered RGB photographs. We propose an automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy models at the texel level from an unordered collection of registered photographs. Our approach establishes correspondences between texels on a UV map and pixels in the input images, with each texel's color computed as a weighted blend of associated pixel values. Using differentiable rendering, we optimize blending parameters to ensure photometric and perspective consistency, while maintaining seamless texture coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse architectural models and varying photographic conditions, enabling the creation of high-quality textures that preserve visual fidelity and structural detail.

- **Summary**: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network, increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis. DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of 110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36 diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946 patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12 senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios, including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

- **Summary**: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM) rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

- **Summary**: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution. Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

- **Summary**: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining, existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level. However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation, where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600), length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10.

- **Summary**: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

- **Summary**: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions, and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output. Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model, enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details, effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets. Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and distillation strategy.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data). UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations. This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods. Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

- **Summary**: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos; however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS). Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities. To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

- **Summary**: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis, traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for fracture detection, demonstrating significant potential in improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes an improved YOLO-based model, termed Fracture-YOLO, which integrates novel Critical-Region-Selector Attention (CRSelector) and Scale-Aware (ScA) heads to further enhance detection performance. Specifically, the CRSelector module utilizes global texture information to focus on critical features of fracture regions. Meanwhile, the ScA module dynamically adjusts the weights of features at different scales, enhancing the model's capacity to identify fracture targets at multiple scales. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline model, Fracture-YOLO achieves a significant improvement in detection precision, with mAP50 and mAP50-95 increasing by 4 and 3, surpassing the baseline model and achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical practice. Despite recent advancements, existing methods still struggle with detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC). Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with FracDetNet achieving a mAP$_{50-95}$ of 40.0\%, reflecting a \textbf{7.5\%} improvement over the baseline model. Furthermore, the mAP$_{50}$ reaches 63.9\%, representing an increase of \textbf{4.2\%}, with fracture-specific detection accuracy also enhanced by \textbf{2.9\%}.

- **Summary**: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable, surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream, identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs. SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can revise their understanding in response to new information.

- **Summary**: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR) networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks have become a cornerstone of medical image analysis due to their proficiency in learning hierarchical spatial features. However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global, holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer, which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to 5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11% accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm for medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image (T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE), an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% using only a single round of correction.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact, estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism. From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses, guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts. This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time optimization and the base T2I model.

- **Summary**: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation (DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

- **Summary**: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose 'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection. RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

- **Summary**: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data. In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters (\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when evaluating claims of such generalization.

- **Summary**: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos. While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex, region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time, space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

- **Summary**: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition, and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision, question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark design and evaluation.

- **Summary**: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module, iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

- **Summary**: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

- **Summary**: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three, and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-, three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking a significant advancement in the literature.
