- **Summary**: The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis, reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases. The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report generation: (1) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive medical reports; (2) Improved methods for medical keyword representation enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (3) Strategies to overcome RNN-based models' limitations, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies within medical descriptions; (4) Techniques to enhance the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.

- **Summary**: Adapting advertisements for multilingual audiences requires more than simple text translation; it demands preservation of visual consistency, spatial alignment, and stylistic integrity across diverse languages and formats. We introduce a structured framework that combines automated components with human oversight to address the complexities of advertisement localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate scene text detection, inpainting, machine translation (MT), and text reimposition specifically for accelerating ad localization evaluation workflows. Qualitative results across six locales demonstrate that our approach produces semantically accurate and visually coherent localized advertisements, suitable for deployment in real-world workflows.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships. While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging FL scenario.

- **Summary**: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media. To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents, equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the effectiveness and value of our framework.

- **Summary**: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks -- achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection, which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs. Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare classes.

- **Summary**: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

- **Summary**: We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters, making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically, LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9% improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge, LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks), adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them, thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials, thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

- **Summary**: The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments. Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However, prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations. Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension. Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Maps have always been an essential component of autonomous driving. With the advancement of autonomous driving technology, both the representation and production process of maps have evolved substantially. The article categorizes the evolution of maps into three stages: High-Definition (HD) maps, Lightweight (Lite) maps, and Implicit maps. For each stage, we provide a comprehensive review of the map production workflow, with highlighting technical challenges involved and summarizing relevant solutions proposed by the academic community. Furthermore, we discuss cutting-edge research advances in map representations and explore how these innovations can be integrated into end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks.

- **Summary**: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and 2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness and generalization.

- **Summary**: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM) dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

- **Summary**: Fontan palliation for univentricular congenital heart disease progresses to hemodynamic failure with complex flow patterns poorly characterized by conventional 2D imaging. Current assessment relies on fluoroscopic angiography, providing limited 3D geometric information essential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and surgical planning.   A multi-step AI pipeline was developed utilizing Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.5B parameters) for systematic, iterative processing of fluoroscopic angiograms through transformer-based neural architecture. The pipeline encompasses medical image preprocessing, vascular segmentation, contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and virtual hemodynamic flow visualization within 2D projections. Final views were processed through Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation.   The pipeline successfully generated geometrically optimized 2D projections from single-view angiograms after 16 processing steps using a custom web interface. Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features requiring iterative refinement to achieve anatomically faithful representations. Final projections demonstrated accurate preservation of complex Fontan geometry with enhanced contrast suitable for 3D conversion. AI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central connections and flow patterns in branch arteries. Complete processing required under 15 minutes with second-level API response times.   This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility of generating CFD-suitable geometries from routine angiographic data, enabling 3D generation and rapid virtual flow visualization for cursory insights prior to full CFD simulation. While requiring refinement cycles for accuracy, this establishes foundation for democratizing advanced geometric and hemodynamic analysis using readily available imaging data.

- **Summary**: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion (MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block (MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone navigation tasks.

- **Summary**: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20 classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly. Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision research.

- **Summary**: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic stereo dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios. Built on the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury, ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under realistic, diverse, and controllable settings, facilitating more robust depth perception systems for autonomous vehicles.

- **Summary**: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the public and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ncfjd/SmokeBench.

- **Summary**: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective: highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/SijuMa2003/RIS-FUSION.

- **Summary**: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives, \textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and \textit{open-world} settings.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection capabilities, vital for reliable AI systems. Despite this promising capability, a comprehensive understanding of (1) why they work so effectively, (2) what advantages do they have over single-modal methods, and (3) how is their behavioral robustness -- remains notably incomplete within the research community. This paper presents a systematic empirical analysis of VLM-based OOD detection using in-distribution (ID) and OOD prompts. (1) Mechanisms: We systematically characterize and formalize key operational properties within the VLM embedding space that facilitate zero-shot OOD detection. (2) Advantages: We empirically quantify the superiority of these models over established single-modal approaches, attributing this distinct advantage to the VLM's capacity to leverage rich semantic novelty. (3) Sensitivity: We uncovers a significant and previously under-explored asymmetry in their robustness profile: while exhibiting resilience to common image noise, these VLM-based methods are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing. Our findings contribute a more structured understanding of the strengths and critical vulnerabilities inherent in VLM-based OOD detection, offering crucial, empirically-grounded guidance for developing more robust and reliable future designs.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training. However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups. We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves 26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

- **Summary**: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models' abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception, environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for future methodological advances.

- **Summary**: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation. Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3) Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components: (1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

- **Summary**: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups. Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures, highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting (GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency, achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8 ``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks based on the ConvNeXt architecture.   For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered ``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.   This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or $l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned filters.   Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

- **Summary**: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy, compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together, these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal LLMs perceive images.

- **Summary**: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task, directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation, but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location. To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules: (1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA approaches.

- **Summary**: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc. However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field. Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality and TDOM geometric accuracy.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module (DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement. To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability. Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

- **Summary**: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential in medical AI. Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) offers a computationally efficient way to quantify model uncertainty alongside predictions, unlike traditional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout and Deep Ensembles (DE). However, all these methods often rely on a single expert's annotations as ground truth for model training, overlooking the inter-rater variability in healthcare. To address this issue, we propose MEGAN, a Multi-Expert Gating Network that aggregates uncertainty estimates and predictions from multiple AI experts via EDL models trained with diverse ground truths and modeling strategies. MEGAN's gating network optimally combines predictions and uncertainties from each EDL model, enhancing overall prediction confidence and calibration. We extensively benchmark MEGAN on endoscopy videos for Ulcerative colitis (UC) disease severity estimation, assessed by visual labeling of Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES), where inter-rater variability is prevalent. In large-scale prospective UC clinical trial, MEGAN achieved a 3.5% improvement in F1-score and a 30.5% reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to existing methods. Furthermore, MEGAN facilitated uncertainty-guided sample stratification, reducing the annotation burden and potentially increasing efficiency and consistency in UC trials.

- **Summary**: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

- **Summary**: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns language with image content at both global and regional levels. These contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2) the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation, connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

- **Summary**: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various applications.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex visual understanding across scientific and reasoning tasks. While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.

- **Summary**: Gestures are central to human communication, enriching interactions through non-verbal expression. Virtual avatars increasingly use AI-generated gestures to enhance life-likeness, yet evaluations have largely been confined to 2D. Virtual Reality (VR) provides an immersive alternative that may affect how gestures are perceived. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of computer-generated gestures in VR and 2D, examining three models from the 2023 GENEA Challenge. Results show that gestures viewed in VR were rated slightly higher on average, with the strongest effect observed for motion-capture "true movement." While model rankings remained consistent across settings, VR influenced participants' overall perception and offered unique benefits over traditional 2D evaluation.

- **Summary**: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck, particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$ to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly, which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps, contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency and model effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However, medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets, limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation. While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings, we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks. Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models. These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining, enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by utilizing in-domain data.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however, remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

- **Summary**: Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total. To benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be open-source.

- **Summary**: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications, offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000 synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation) diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations. These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques can be adapted to other fields.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function, combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1 substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks. These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be available at https://github.com/YBYBZhang/Tool-R1.

- **Summary**: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations. In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90% congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

- **Summary**: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2) Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM), which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various few-shot settings.

- **Summary**: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge. Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM, equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability.

- **Summary**: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb, target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1) inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally, comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities. To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

- **Summary**: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers, the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly. Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

- **Summary**: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast, and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images. Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities, attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities, attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection, semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

- **Summary**: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment, differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

- **Summary**: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations, dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies, resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion. Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions, strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations. These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1 FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains: compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and efficient solution for aerial object tracking.

- **Summary**: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels, significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from 26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

- **Summary**: Utilizing recently developed abstract notions of sectional curvature, we introduce a method for constructing a curvature-based geometric profile of discrete metric spaces. The curvature concept that we use here captures the metric relations between triples of points and other points. More significantly, based on this curvature profile, we introduce a quantitative measure to evaluate the effectiveness of data representations, such as those produced by dimensionality reduction techniques. Furthermore, Our experiments demonstrate that this curvature-based analysis can be employed to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of datasets. We use this to explore the large-scale geometry of empirical networks and to evaluate the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction techniques.

- **Summary**: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.

- **Summary**: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception, thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency, to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making.

- **Summary**: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a 4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale, generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations. Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics. While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation, creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects. This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

- **Summary**: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar, leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains. Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

- **Summary**: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives. These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training, and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review process.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario. Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities, an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to 1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

- **Summary**: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however, presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents (FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts, degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

- **Summary**: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9 participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics (Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

- **Summary**: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep neural network training.

  omnidirectional vision in the context of embodied AI
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception, omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems. Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.

- **Summary**: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/DR-MoE.



### Brought a Gun to a Knife Fight: Modern VFM Baselines Outgun Specialized Detectors on In-the-Wild AI Image Detection

- **Summary**: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.   Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder, Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date, ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection, the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the `craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history, including pre-training.

- **Summary**: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras (event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations that lack power infrastructure.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input, making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS) from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready 3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

- **Summary**: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities. However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient inference in HR-LVLMs.

- **Summary**: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS), Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM), which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes. Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation introduced in earlier stages.

- **Summary**: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at: https://github.com/YanXY000/LLFDisc

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings (e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

- **Summary**: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95) up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

- **Summary**: As a developing country, Fiji is facing rapid urbanisation, which is visible in the massive development projects that include housing, roads, and civil works. In this study, we present machine learning and remote sensing frameworks to compare land use and land cover change from 2013 to 2024 in Nadi, Fiji. The ultimate goal of this study is to provide technical support in land cover/land use modelling and change detection. We used Landsat-8 satellite image for the study region and created our training dataset with labels for supervised machine learning. We used Google Earth Engine and unsupervised machine learning via k-means clustering to generate the land cover map. We used convolutional neural networks to classify the selected regions' land cover types. We present a visualisation of change detection, highlighting urban area changes over time to monitor changes in the map.

- **Summary**: The detection of anomalies in automotive cabin sounds is critical for ensuring vehicle quality and maintaining passenger comfort. In many real-world settings, this task is more appropriately framed as an unsupervised learning problem rather than the supervised case due to the scarcity or complete absence of labeled faulty data. In such an unsupervised setting, the model is trained exclusively on healthy samples and detects anomalies as deviations from normal behavior. However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and the limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation reconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach for model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set to support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a high-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin sounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation, Whine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation. This dataset, generated using advanced sound synthesis techniques, and validated via expert jury assessments, has been made publicly available to facilitate further research. Experimental evaluations on the five fault cases demonstrate the selection of optimal models using proxy-anomalies, significantly outperform conventional model selection strategies.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of sophisticated deepfake technology poses significant challenges to digital security and authenticity. Detecting these forgeries, especially across a wide spectrum of manipulation techniques, requires robust and generalized models. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Deep Fusion Framework (HDFF), an ensemble-based deep learning architecture designed for high-performance facial forgery detection. Our framework integrates four diverse pre-trained sub-models, Swin-MLP, CoAtNet, EfficientNetV2, and DaViT, which are meticulously fine-tuned through a multi-stage process on the MultiFFDI dataset. By concatenating the feature representations from these specialized models and training a final classifier layer, HDFF effectively leverages their collective strengths. This approach achieved a final score of 0.96852 on the competition's private leaderboard, securing the 20th position out of 184 teams, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical fusion for complex image classification tasks.

- **Summary**: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations, and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

- **Summary**: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light, occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and the dataset have been made publicly available at https://github.com/zzh362/CRPS-D.

- **Summary**: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling, resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

- **Summary**: Recognizing textual attributes such as bold, italic, underline and strikeout is essential for understanding text semantics, structure, and visual presentation. These attributes highlight key information, making them crucial for document analysis. Existing methods struggle with computational efficiency or adaptability in noisy, multilingual settings. To address this, we introduce TexTAR, a multi-task, context-aware Transformer for Textual Attribute Recognition (TAR). Our novel data selection pipeline enhances context awareness, and our architecture employs a 2D RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding)-style mechanism to incorporate input context for more accurate attribute predictions. We also introduce MMTAD, a diverse, multilingual, multi-domain dataset annotated with text attributes across real-world documents such as legal records, notices, and textbooks. Extensive evaluations show TexTAR outperforms existing methods, demonstrating that contextual awareness contributes to state-of-the-art TAR performance.

- **Summary**: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a promising avenue for advancing video language models.

- **Summary**: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city, richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50 species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics, WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory. We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization, spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree asset management.

- **Summary**: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments) without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale "silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard" dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems.

- **Summary**: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal, since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

- **Summary**: Violence detection in public surveillance is critical for public safety. This study addresses challenges such as small-scale targets, complex environments, and real-time temporal analysis. We propose Vi-SAFE, a spatial-temporal framework that integrates an enhanced YOLOv8 with a Temporal Segment Network (TSN) for video surveillance. The YOLOv8 model is optimized with GhostNetV3 as a lightweight backbone, an exponential moving average (EMA) attention mechanism, and pruning to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy. YOLOv8 and TSN are trained separately on pedestrian and violence datasets, where YOLOv8 extracts human regions and TSN performs binary classification of violent behavior. Experiments on the RWF-2000 dataset show that Vi-SAFE achieves an accuracy of 0.88, surpassing TSN alone (0.77) and outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its effectiveness for public safety surveillance.

- **Summary**: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements, diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically, End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset will be released soon.



### Curriculum Multi-Task Self-Supervision Improves Lightweight Architectures for Onboard Satellite Hyperspectral Image Segmentation

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for real-world HSI applications.

- **Summary**: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open, lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician trust in clinical workflows.

- **Summary**: Ensuring consistent quality in vacuum thermoforming presents challenges due to variations in material properties and tooling configurations. This research introduces a vision-based quality control system to predict and optimise process parameters, thereby enhancing part quality with minimal data requirements. A comprehensive dataset was developed using visual data from vacuum-formed samples subjected to various process parameters, supplemented by image augmentation techniques to improve model training. A k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm was subsequently employed to identify adjustments needed in process parameters by mapping low-quality parts to their high-quality counterparts. The model exhibited strong performance in adjusting heating power, heating time, and vacuum time to reduce defects and improve production efficiency.

- **Summary**: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation, require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT) architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model. Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost (up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel three-stage framework for real-time foreign object intrusion (FOI) detection and tracking in power transmission systems. The framework integrates: (1) a YOLOv7 segmentation model for fast and robust object localization, (2) a ConvNeXt-based feature extractor trained with triplet loss to generate discriminative embeddings, and (3) a feature-assisted IoU tracker that ensures resilient multi-object tracking under occlusion and motion. To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's practicality and scalability for real-world edge applications.

- **Summary**: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports. Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated, AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners. In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to 17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases. RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable, feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI resources in education.

- **Summary**: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

- **Summary**: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated images and identifying visually inconsistent regions is crucial for practical use of AI-generated images and for improving photorealism of generative AI via realness feedback during training. This paper introduces a framework that accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

- **Summary**: Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision--language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise.   To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation, it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over time.   Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1), flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data. Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.

- **Summary**: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner, enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of 3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels, allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

- **Summary**: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings, which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth 3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric measurements.

- **Summary**: We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets, along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a universal 3D reconstruction backbone.

- **Summary**: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most commonly performed imaging investigation. In the UK, many centres experience reporting delays due to radiologist workforce shortages. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of distinguishing normal from abnormal CXRs have emerged as a potential solution. If normal CXRs could be safely identified and reported without human input, a substantial portion of radiology workload could be reduced.   This article examines the feasibility and implications of autonomous AI reporting of normal CXRs. Key issues include defining normal, ensuring generalisability across populations, and managing the sensitivity-specificity trade-off. It also addresses legal and regulatory challenges, such as compliance with IR(ME)R and GDPR, and the lack accountability frameworks for errors. Further considerations include the impact on radiologists practice, the need for robust post-market surveillance, and incorporation of patient perspectives. While the benefits are clear, adoption must be cautious.

- **Summary**: Ensuring accurate localization of robots in environments without GPS capability is a challenging task. Visual Place Recognition (VPR) techniques can potentially achieve this goal, but existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to changes in illumination, weather, and other seasonal changes. Existing cross-modal localization methods leverage the geometric properties of RGB images and 3D LiDAR maps to reduce the sensitivity issues highlighted above. Currently, state-of-the-art methods struggle in complex scenes, fine-grained or high-resolution matching, and situations where changes can occur in viewpoint. In this work, we introduce a framework we call Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal Place Recognition (SCM-PR) that combines high-level semantics utilizing RGB images for robust localization in LiDAR maps. Our proposed method introduces: a VMamba backbone for feature extraction of RGB images; a Semantic-Aware Feature Fusion (SAFF) module for using both place descriptors and segmentation masks; LiDAR descriptors that incorporate both semantics and geometry; and a cross-modal semantic attention mechanism in NetVLAD to improve matching. Incorporating the semantic information also was instrumental in designing a Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching and a Semantic Consistency Loss, both in a contrastive learning framework. Our experimental work on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets show that SCM-PR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other cross-modal place recognition methods.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is rapidly gaining popularity for its photorealistic rendering quality and real-time performance, but it generates massive amounts of data. Hence compressing 3DGS data is necessary for the cost effectiveness of 3DGS models. Recently, several anchor-based neural compression methods have been proposed, achieving good 3DGS compression performance. However, they all rely on uniform scalar quantization (USQ) due to its simplicity. A tantalizing question is whether more sophisticated quantizers can improve the current 3DGS compression methods with very little extra overhead and minimal change to the system. The answer is yes by replacing USQ with lattice vector quantization (LVQ). To better capture scene-specific characteristics, we optimize the lattice basis for each scene, improving LVQ's adaptability and R-D efficiency. This scene-adaptive LVQ (SALVQ) strikes a balance between the R-D efficiency of vector quantization and the low complexity of USQ. SALVQ can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS compression architectures, enhancing their R-D performance with minimal modifications and computational overhead. Moreover, by scaling the lattice basis vectors, SALVQ can dynamically adjust lattice density, enabling a single model to accommodate multiple bit rate targets. This flexibility eliminates the need to train separate models for different compression levels, significantly reducing training time and memory consumption.

- **Summary**: Understanding group-level social interactions in public spaces is crucial for urban planning, informing the design of socially vibrant and inclusive environments. Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage of real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Bias discovery is critical for black-box generative models, especiall text-to-image (TTI) models. Existing works predominantly focus on output-level demographic distributions, which do not neces- sarily guarantee concept representations to be disentangled post- mitigation. We propose BiasMap, a model-agnostic framework for uncovering latent concept-level representational biases in stable dif- fusion models. BiasMap leverages cross-attention attribution maps to reveal structural entanglements between demographics (e.g., gender, race) and semantics (e.g., professions), going deeper into representational bias during the image generation. Using attribu- tion maps of these concepts, we quantify the spatial demographics- semantics concept entanglement via Intersection over Union (IoU), offering a lens into bias that remains hidden in existing fairness dis- covery approaches. In addition, we further utilize BiasMap for bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion sampling that directly modifies latent noise space and minimizes the expected SoftIoU dur- ing the denoising process. Our findings show that existing fairness interventions may reduce the output distributional gap but often fail to disentangle concept-level coupling, whereas our mitigation method can mitigate concept entanglement in image generation while complementing distributional bias mitigation.

- **Summary**: The lack of flexible annotation tools has hindered the deployment of AI models in some scientific areas. Most existing image annotation software requires users to upload a precollected dataset, which limits support for on-demand pipelines and introduces unnecessary steps to acquire images. This constraint is particularly problematic in laboratory environments, where real-time data acquisition from instruments such as microscopes is increasingly common. In this work, we introduce \texttt{LivePixel}, a Python-based graphical user interface that integrates with imaging systems, such as webcams, microscopes, and others, to enable real-time image annotation. LivePyxel is designed to be easy to use through a simple interface that allows users to precisely delimit areas for annotation using tools commonly found in commercial graphics editing software. Of particular interest is the availability of B\'ezier splines and binary masks, and the software's capacity to work with non-destructive layers that enable high-performance editing. LivePyxel also integrates a wide compatibility across video devices, and it's optimized for object detection operations via the use of OpenCV in combination with high-performance libraries designed to handle matrix and linear algebra operations via Numpy effectively. LivePyxel facilitates seamless data collection and labeling, accelerating the development of AI models in experimental workflows. LivePyxel freely available at https://github.com/UGarCil/LivePyxel

- **Summary**: Diffusion models enable high-quality virtual try-on (VTO) with their established image synthesis abilities. Despite the extensive end-to-end training of large pre-trained models involved in current VTO methods, real-world applications often prioritize limited training and inference, serving, and deployment budgets for VTO. To solve this obstacle, we apply Doob's h-transform efficient fine-tuning (DEFT) for adapting large pre-trained unconditional models for downstream image-conditioned VTO abilities. DEFT freezes the pre-trained model's parameters and trains a small h-transform network to learn a conditional h-transform. The h-transform network allows training only 1.42 percent of the frozen parameters, compared to a baseline of 5.52 percent in traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).   To further improve DEFT's performance and decrease existing models' inference time, we additionally propose an adaptive consistency loss. Consistency training distills slow but high-performing diffusion models into a fast one while retaining performance by enforcing consistencies along the inference path. Inspired by constrained optimization, instead of distillation, we combine the consistency loss and the denoising score matching loss in a data-adaptive manner for fine-tuning existing VTO models at a low cost. Empirical results show the proposed DEFT-VTON method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTO tasks, with as few as 15 denoising steps, while maintaining competitive results.

- **Summary**: In the autonomous driving area synthetic data is crucial for cover specific traffic scenarios which autonomous vehicle must handle. This data commonly introduces domain gap between synthetic and real domains. In this paper we deploy data augmentation to generate custom traffic scenarios with VRUs in order to improve pedestrian recognition. We provide a pipeline for augmentation of the Cityscapes dataset with virtual pedestrians. In order to improve augmentation realism of the pipeline we reveal a novel generative network architecture for adversarial learning of the data-set lighting conditions. We also evaluate our approach on the tasks of semantic and instance segmentation.

- **Summary**: Medical image enhancement and segmentation are critical yet challenging tasks in modern clinical practice, constrained by artifacts and complex anatomical variations. Traditional deep learning approaches often rely on complex architectures with limited interpretability. While Kolmogorov-Arnold networks offer interpretable solutions, their reliance on flattened feature representations fundamentally disrupts the intrinsic spatial structure of imaging data. To address this issue we propose a Functional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (FunKAN) -- a novel interpretable neural framework, designed specifically for image processing, that formally generalizes the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem onto functional spaces and learns inner functions using Fourier decomposition over the basis Hermite functions. We explore FunKAN on several medical image processing tasks, including Gibbs ringing suppression in magnetic resonance images, benchmarking on IXI dataset. We also propose U-FunKAN as state-of-the-art binary medical segmentation model with benchmarks on three medical datasets: BUSI (ultrasound images), GlaS (histological structures) and CVC-ClinicDB (colonoscopy videos), detecting breast cancer, glands and polyps, respectively. Experiments on those diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other KAN-based backbones in both medical image enhancement (PSNR, TV) and segmentation (IoU, F1). Our work bridges the gap between theoretical function approximation and medical image analysis, offering a robust, interpretable solution for clinical applications.

- **Summary**: Hateful videos present serious risks to online safety and real-world well-being, necessitating effective detection methods. Although multimodal classification approaches integrating information from several modalities outperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful content defines a video's category. Specifically, they generally treat all content uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally, existing multimodal methods cannot systematically capture structured information in videos, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal dual-stream graph neural network model. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given video into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a complementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features, highlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are combined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to systematically model structured relationships within and across modalities. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is state-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional (3D) scene understanding in colonoscopy presents significant challenges that necessitate automated methods for accurate depth estimation. However, existing depth estimation models for endoscopy struggle with temporal consistency across video sequences, limiting their applicability for 3D reconstruction. We present ColonCrafter, a diffusion-based depth estimation model that generates temporally consistent depth maps from monocular colonoscopy videos. Our approach learns robust geometric priors from synthetic colonoscopy sequences to generate temporally consistent depth maps. We also introduce a style transfer technique that preserves geometric structure while adapting real clinical videos to match our synthetic training domain. ColonCrafter achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the C3VD dataset, outperforming both general-purpose and endoscopy-specific approaches. Although full trajectory 3D reconstruction remains a challenge, we demonstrate clinically relevant applications of ColonCrafter, including 3D point cloud generation and surface coverage assessment.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made a significant impact on rendering and reconstruction techniques. Current research predominantly focuses on improving rendering performance and reconstruction quality using high-performance desktop GPUs, largely overlooking applications for embedded platforms like micro air vehicles (MAVs). These devices, with their limited computational resources and memory, often face a trade-off between system performance and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we improve existing methods in terms of GPU memory usage while enhancing rendering quality. Specifically, to address redundant 3D Gaussian primitives in SLAM, we propose merging them in voxel space based on geometric similarity. This reduces GPU memory usage without impacting system runtime performance. Furthermore, rendering quality is improved by initializing 3D Gaussian primitives via Patch-Grid (PG) point sampling, enabling more accurate modeling of the entire scene. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our improvements.

- **Summary**: Central airway obstruction (CAO) is a life-threatening condition with increasing incidence, caused by tumors in and outside of the airway. Traditional treatment methods such as bronchoscopy and electrocautery can be used to remove the tumor completely; however, these methods carry a high risk of complications. Recent advances allow robotic interventions with lesser risk. The combination of robot interventions with scene understanding and mapping also opens up the possibilities for automation. We present a novel pipeline that enables real-time, semantically informed 3D reconstructions of the central airway using monocular endoscopic video.   Our approach combines DROID-SLAM with a segmentation model trained to identify obstructive tissues. The SLAM module reconstructs the 3D geometry of the airway in real time, while the segmentation masks guide the annotation of obstruction regions within the reconstructed point cloud. To validate our pipeline, we evaluate the reconstruction quality using ex vivo models.   Qualitative and quantitative results show high similarity between ground truth CT scans and the 3D reconstructions (0.62 mm Chamfer distance). By integrating segmentation directly into the SLAM workflow, our system produces annotated 3D maps that highlight clinically relevant regions in real time. High-speed capabilities of the pipeline allows quicker reconstructions compared to previous work, reflecting the surgical scene more accurately.   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate semantic segmentation with real-time monocular SLAM for endoscopic CAO scenarios. Our framework is modular and can generalize to other anatomies or procedures with minimal changes, offering a promising step toward autonomous robotic interventions.

- **Summary**: Sparse-View CT (SVCT) reconstruction enhances temporal resolution and reduces radiation dose, yet its clinical use is hindered by artifacts due to view reduction and domain shifts from scanner, protocol, or anatomical variations, leading to performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this work, we propose a Cross-Distribution Diffusion Priors-Driven Iterative Reconstruction (CDPIR) framework to tackle the OOD problem in SVCT. CDPIR integrates cross-distribution diffusion priors, derived from a Scalable Interpolant Transformer (SiT), with model-based iterative reconstruction methods. Specifically, we train a SiT backbone, an extension of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, to establish a unified stochastic interpolant framework, leveraging Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) across multiple datasets. By randomly dropping the conditioning with a null embedding during training, the model learns both domain-specific and domain-invariant priors, enhancing generalizability. During sampling, the globally sensitive transformer-based diffusion model exploits the cross-distribution prior within the unified stochastic interpolant framework, enabling flexible and stable control over multi-distribution-to-noise interpolation paths and decoupled sampling strategies, thereby improving adaptation to OOD reconstruction. By alternating between data fidelity and sampling updates, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior detail preservation in SVCT reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDPIR significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly under OOD conditions, highlighting its robustness and potential clinical value in challenging imaging scenarios.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably face distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation, trajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study formulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing formal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms [1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces adaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving environments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals that prediction errors--even on in-distribution samples--exhibit mode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific dynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates. Comprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.

- **Summary**: The Amazon rain forest is a vital ecosystem that plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and providing habitat for countless species. Deforestation in the Amazon is a major concern as it has a significant impact on global carbon emissions and biodiversity. In this paper, we present a method for detecting deforestation in the Amazon using image pairs from Earth observation satellites. Our method leverages deep learning techniques to compare the images of the same area at different dates and identify changes in the forest cover. We also propose a visual semantic model that automatically annotates the detected changes with relevant keywords. The candidate annotation for images are extracted from scientific documents related to the Amazon region. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of Amazon image pairs and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting deforestation and generating relevant annotations. Our method provides a useful tool for monitoring and studying the impact of deforestation in the Amazon. While we focus on environment applications of our work by using images of deforestation in the Amazon rain forest to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, it is generic enough to be applied to other domains.

- **Summary**: Robust object pose estimation is essential for manipulation and interaction tasks in robotics, particularly in scenarios where visual data is limited or sensitive to lighting, occlusions, and appearances. Tactile sensors often offer limited and local contact information, making it challenging to reconstruct the pose from partial data. Our approach uses sensorimotor exploration to actively control a robot hand to interact with the object. We train with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to explore and collect tactile data. The collected 3D point clouds are used to iteratively refine the object's shape and pose. In our setup, one hand holds the object steady while the other performs active exploration. We show that our method can actively explore an object's surface to identify critical pose features without prior knowledge of the object's geometry.
