- **Summary**: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks, significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns, researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms, ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis, and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks, offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of generative models.

- **Summary**: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging, particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning (GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP (+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations.

- **Summary**: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels, capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model, crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods. This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems with stronger perceptual capabilities.



### ER-LoRA: Effective-Rank Guided Adaptation for Weather-Generalized Depth Estimation

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog, snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data. Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to achieve weather-generalized depth estimation by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small amount of high-visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored for geometry -- centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge. To this end, we introduce the Selecting-Tuning-Maintaining (STM) strategy, which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds of effective ranks (entropy-rank and stable-rank). In the tuning phase, we adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task-aware singular directions for initialization, based on the entropy-rank and full-tuned weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction regularization based on the stable-rank. This design guarantees flexible task adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmarks across diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing PEFT methods and full fine-tuning but also surpasses methods trained with adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model



### LLaVA-Critic-R1: Your Critic Model is Secretly a Strong Policy Model

- **Summary**: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model, producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly, LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B). Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale. Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable, self-improving multimodal systems.

- **Summary**: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result, modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization, but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba (CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of reducing the network training burden.

- **Summary**: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition. Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release our code and model checkpoints.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets (rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM training with limited aligned data.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.



### EVENT-Retriever: Event-Aware Multimodal Image Retrieval for Realistic Captions

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search, Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/vdkhoi20/EVENT-Retriever.

- **Summary**: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks: image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval. Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of 0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical settings.

- **Summary**: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined message. We propose the first generalizable watermarking framework that enables efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views.

- **Summary**: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI) detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline. To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

- **Summary**: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes. Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed, existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse objects and scenes.

- **Summary**: Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset) presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything) have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g., Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition. Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require highly efficient matrix multiplication engines for complex computations. This paper presents a systolic array architecture incorporating novel exact and approximate processing elements (PEs), designed using energy-efficient positive partial product and negative partial product cells, termed as PPC and NPPC, respectively. The proposed 8-bit exact and approximate PE designs are employed in a 8x8 systolic array, which achieves a energy savings of 22% and 32%, respectively, compared to the existing design. To demonstrate their effectiveness, the proposed PEs are integrated into a systolic array (SA) for Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) computation, achieving high output quality with a PSNR of 38.21,dB. Furthermore, in an edge detection application using convolution, the approximate PE achieves a PSNR of 30.45,dB. These results highlight the potential of the proposed design to deliver significant energy efficiency while maintaining competitive output quality, making it well-suited for error-resilient image and vision processing applications.

- **Summary**: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and (ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is available at https://github.com/LLiDaBao/AAGLSD.

- **Summary**: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and natural language explanations, generated through a novel hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

- **Summary**: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

- **Summary**: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues, however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI, particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy, combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

- **Summary**: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters, transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories, the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under real-world image quality variations.

- **Summary**: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels' probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP) masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics. Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

- **Summary**: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3 backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width, and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks. This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however, atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically, on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse remote sensing applications.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

- **Summary**: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data, while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method, FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and OOD image classification tasks.

- **Summary**: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5 Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.

In contrast, pose data provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050 adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA) module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://zhouzi180.github.io/Scoliosis1K/.

- **Summary**: As early detection of breast cancer strongly favors successful therapeutic outcomes, there is major commercial interest in optimizing breast cancer screening. However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance and do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was FDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an individual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT. Using an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients, we trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI DINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a patient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years. On a held-out test set, our best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.80 on predictions within 5 years. These findings reveal the high potential of DBT-based DL approaches to complement traditional risk assessment tools, and serve as a promising basis for additional investigation to validate and enhance our work.

- **Summary**: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals, we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to 0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for our method will be available at https://github.com/greatest-gourmet/Spotlighter.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a promising alternative to neural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image quality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still struggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based accelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting operations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical trade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively reduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary rasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG groups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across tiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During rasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small tiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG enables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping tiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with the original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is a lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be seamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental results show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.

- **Summary**: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times, which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this, we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM 2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components, DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

- **Summary**: Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure, which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4. Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic heterogeneity.

- **Summary**: To develop and externally validate integrated ultrasound nomograms combining BIRADS features and quantitative morphometric characteristics, and to compare their performance with expert radiologists and state of the art large language models in biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction for breast lesions. In this retrospective multicenter, multinational study, 1747 women with pathologically confirmed breast lesions underwent ultrasound across three centers in Iran and Turkey. A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features were extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram integrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three radiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently interpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for biopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in internal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused nomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and malignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two tasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was significantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and both ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction. External validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different ultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric nomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in guiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy. These interpretable, externally validated tools have the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies and enhance personalized decision making in breast imaging.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more) elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

- **Summary**: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery (red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same, regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2) Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized, optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization, offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals, and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts. While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

- **Summary**: Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse, with climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution leading to a projected 70-90% loss of coral species within the next decade. Restoration efforts are crucial, but their success hinges on introducing automation to upscale efforts. We present automated deployment of coral re-seeding devices powered by artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. Specifically, we perform automated substrate classification, enabling detection of areas of the seafloor suitable for coral growth, thus significantly reducing reliance on human experts and increasing the range and efficiency of restoration. Real-world testing of the algorithms on the Great Barrier Reef leads to deployment accuracy of 77.8%, sub-image patch classification of 89.1%, and real-time model inference at 5.5 frames per second. Further, we present and publicly contribute a large collection of annotated substrate image data to foster future research in this area.

- **Summary**: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes, preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach, CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.
