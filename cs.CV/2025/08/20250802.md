- **Summary**: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction, advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective. However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth 3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

- **Summary**: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and 578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing (unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization, skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7% (image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA) methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset, indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its potential for real-world clinical applications.

- **Summary**: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding. OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement 17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process, adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://m-e-agi-lab.github.io/PSAlign/.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask. Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics. Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$ gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at https://github.com/XinyuYanTJU/LawDIS.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general applicability.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step. Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap. It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page: https://ranrhuang.github.io/spfsplat/.



### Large Language Models Facilitate Vision Reflection in Image Classification

- **Summary**: This paper presents several novel findings on the explainability of vision reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs). First, we show that prompting an LMM to verify the prediction of a specialized vision model can improve recognition accuracy, even on benchmarks like ImageNet, despite prior evidence that LMMs typically underperform dedicated vision encoders. Second, we analyze the internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language connector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the language model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense knowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens with only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers, suggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual representations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a training-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition tasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings offer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and suggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and interpretable visual recognition.



### Benchmarking and Bridging Emotion Conflicts for Multimodal Emotion Reasoning

- **Summary**: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under modality conflict conditions.

- **Summary**: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.

- **Summary**: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task. Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual, and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

- **Summary**: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%. This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to evaluating the pavement network in the future.

- **Summary**: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies provides effective information for the planning and control system of autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba. Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture. The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million samples.



### StyDeco: Unsupervised Style Transfer with Distilling Priors and Semantic Decoupling

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer, but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper, we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling (CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters. Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

- **Summary**: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc) has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty. In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness and accuracy.

- **Summary**: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process, relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world settings.

- **Summary**: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP, ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval. Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient, backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$ training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training regime.

- **Summary**: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128 Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to 18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

- **Summary**: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

- **Summary**: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples, we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

- **Summary**: This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to 200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).

- **Summary**: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method (ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates. Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6% with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

- **Summary**: Video-based behavior recognition is essential in fields such as public safety, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) effectively capture local spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The 3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity. Ablation studies further validate the complementary strengths of the two modules. This hybrid framework offers an effective and scalable solution for video-based behavior recognition.

- **Summary**: We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to understand and generate text-serialized 3D meshes. Our approach addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+ samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies, significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding, highlighting its great potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes.

- **Summary**: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net, a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy, thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and diffusion-based image generation techniques.

- **Summary**: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes, lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions. WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be released at \href{https://github.com/CVI-SZU/DisFaceRep}{\textcolor{cyan}{https://github.com/CVI-SZU/DisFaceRep}}.

- **Summary**: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV) object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers 18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement. In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads, unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger ViT-L/14.

- **Summary**: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness and calibration of point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy, calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement uncertainty.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored. Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships. Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision (PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality, but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%), while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks. However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically, the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence. Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss (WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2) a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at https://github.com/brAIn-science/CoCoLIT.

- **Summary**: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space (mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics. Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization performance of existing SM networks.

- **Summary**: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module, to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor (KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder. Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers previous category information and returns category-adaptive representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of 66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD, respectively.

Our method reformulates the problem into a quartic polynomial with coefficients that are analytically simple and computationally efficient. Despite its simplicity, the proposed solver achieves accuracy and runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets validate its robustness and efficiency. This combination of simplicity and performance makes our solver appealing for both real-time systems and educational contexts, where interpretability and reliability are critical.

- **Summary**: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1) functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world diagnostic settings.

- **Summary**: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is thus critical in both civilian and military applications. This study addresses the challenge of precisely IRSTD in complex backgrounds. Recent methods focus fundamental reliance on conventional convolution operations, which primarily capture local spatial patterns and struggle to distinguish the unique frequency-domain characteristics of small targets from intricate background clutter. To overcome these limitations, we proposed the Synergistic Wavelet-Attention Network (SWAN), a novel framework designed to perceive targets from both spatial and frequency domains. SWAN leverages a Haar Wavelet Convolution (HWConv) for a deep, cross-domain fusion of the frequency energy and spatial details of small target. Furthermore, a Shifted Spatial Attention (SSA) mechanism efficiently models long-range spatial dependencies with linear computational complexity, enhancing contextual awareness. Finally, a Residual Dual-Channel Attention (RDCA) module adaptively calibrates channel-wise feature responses to suppress background interference while amplifying target-pertinent signals. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SWAN surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness, particularly in complex challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction. In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics, achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory speed.

- **Summary**: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

- **Summary**: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors, suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through online platforms.

- **Summary**: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL) has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper, we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations. Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads, where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both detection and localization accuracy.

- **Summary**: Reliable and real-time detection of road speed bumps and potholes is crucial for anticipatory perception in advanced suspension systems, enabling timely and adaptive damping control. Achieving high accuracy and efficiency on embedded platforms remains challenging due to limited computational resources and the small scale of distant targets. This paper presents SBP-YOLO, a lightweight and high-speed detection framework tailored for bump and pothole recognition. Based on YOLOv11n, the model integrates GhostConv and VoVGSCSPC modules into the backbone and neck to reduce computation while enhancing multi-scale semantic features. To improve small-object detection, a P2-level branch is introduced with a lightweight and efficient detection head LEDH mitigating the added computational overhead without compromising accuracy. A hybrid training strategy combining NWD loss, backbone-level knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-driven augmentation further enhances localization precision and robustness. Experiments show that SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0 percent mAP, outperforming the YOLOv11n baseline by 5.8 percent. After TensorRT FP16 quantization, it runs at 139.5 FPS on Jetson AGX Xavier, delivering a 12.4 percent speedup over the P2-enhanced YOLOv11. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for fast and low-latency road condition perception in embedded suspension control systems.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do. Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame. This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both (\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction (RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction; (\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and training logs are available as the supplement.

- **Summary**: The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has greatly improved the interpretation of medical images. However, conventional CNNs typically demand extensive computational resources and large training datasets. To address these limitations, this study applied transfer learning to achieve strong classification performance using fewer training samples. Specifically, the study compared EfficientNetV2 with its predecessor, EfficientNet, and with ResNet50 in classifying brain tumors into three types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. Results showed that EfficientNetV2 delivered superior performance compared to the other models. However, this improvement came at the cost of increased training time, likely due to the model's greater complexity.

- **Summary**: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping, especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets: Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets, with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.

- **Summary**: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR). Current deep learning approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data classes, scarcity of moderate damage examples, and human inaccuracy in pixel labeling during HADR situations. To accommodate for these limitations and exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

- **Summary**: The reconstruction of multi-layer 3D garments typically requires expensive multi-view capture setups and specialized 3D editing efforts. To support the creation of life-like clothed human avatars, we introduce ReMu for reconstructing multi-layer clothed humans in a new setup, Image Layers, which captures a subject wearing different layers of clothing with a single RGB camera. To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified 3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner. Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our experiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D clothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to category-specific methods.

- **Summary**: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression. During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores, filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model, supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

- **Summary**: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms. Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT. Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO 2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is 5x that of MobileViT-X.

- **Summary**: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration, enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent, and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera intrinsics and extrinsics.

- **Summary**: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints, occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery. This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of 91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

- **Summary**: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval (OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues, regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories. Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

- **Summary**: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data (unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the ``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma parameters for the two domains.

- **Summary**: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

- **Summary**: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics, object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7 to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration. (3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6 FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers stable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at https://github.com/JiayuanWang-JW/RMT-PPAD.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,   holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,   segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on   non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance. However,   these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local self-similarity   tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To address   this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition for the first   time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity non-local   self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs   coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local   self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition builds   upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural information of the   image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices. The   fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local detail   information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This   architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local, and non-local   priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong   applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of missing   scenes such as pixels and stripes.

- **Summary**: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy, mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25 and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation, Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability, highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

- **Summary**: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space, scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes, making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment. Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and graph-based baselines.

- **Summary**: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community
