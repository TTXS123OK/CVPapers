- **Summary**: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations. Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM) and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality. Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique, applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the other methods.

  Breakthroughs and Future Horizon (DGEBF)
- **Summary**: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters: shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces; specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101, Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

- **Summary**: Modern action recognition models suffer from static bias, leading to reduced generalization performance. In this paper, we propose MoExDA, a lightweight domain adaptation between RGB and edge information using edge frames in addition to RGB frames to counter the static bias issue. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses static bias with a lower computational cost, allowing for more robust action recognition than previous approaches.

- **Summary**: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks, increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second, AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to 83% with superior speed and imperceptibility.

- **Summary**: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation, and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning, while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability. Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic segmentation task of domain generalization.

- **Summary**: Multimodal medical image fusion integrates complementary information from different imaging modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. While deep learning methods have advanced performance, existing approaches face critical limitations: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at local feature extraction but struggle to model global context effectively, while Transformers achieve superior long-range modeling at the cost of quadratic computational complexity, limiting clinical deployment. Recent State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling efficient long-range dependency modeling in linear time through selective scan mechanisms. Despite these advances, the extension to 3D volumetric data and the clinical validation of fused images remains underexplored. In this work, we propose ClinicalFMamba, a novel end-to-end CNN-Mamba hybrid architecture that synergistically combines local and global feature modeling for 2D and 3D images. We further design a tri-plane scanning strategy for effectively learning volumetric dependencies in 3D images. Comprehensive evaluations on three datasets demonstrate the superior fusion performance across multiple quantitative metrics while achieving real-time fusion. We further validate the clinical utility of our approach on downstream 2D/3D brain tumor classification tasks, achieving superior performance over baseline methods. Our method establishes a new paradigm for efficient multimodal medical image fusion suitable for real-time clinical deployment.

- **Summary**: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG. The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability. Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS, a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

- **Summary**: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals, promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face similarity.

- **Summary**: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and 3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors. To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos, establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research.

### Uncertainty-Guided Face Matting for Occlusion-Aware Face Transformation

- **Summary**: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However, their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation, we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at https://github.com/hyebin-c/FaceMat.git

- **Summary**: Point clouds have become an increasingly important representation for 3D medical imaging, offering a compact, surface-preserving alternative to traditional voxel or mesh-based approaches. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled rapid progress in extracting, modeling, and analyzing anatomical shapes directly from point cloud data. This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic survey of learning-based shape analysis for medical point clouds, focusing on three fundamental tasks: registration, reconstruction, and variation modeling. We review recent literature from 2021 to 2025, summarize representative methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and highlight clinical applications and unique challenges in the medical domain. Key trends include the integration of hybrid representations, large-scale self-supervised models, and generative techniques. We also discuss current limitations, such as data scarcity, inter-patient variability, and the need for interpretable and robust solutions for clinical deployment. Finally, future directions are outlined for advancing point cloud-based shape learning in medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization, which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

- **Summary**: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage, based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels. A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local information within global features is introduced to enhance learning comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels. Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision, Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution for the UDA in Person ReID.

- **Summary**: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba, a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Arbitrary-resolution super-resolution (ARSR) provides crucial flexibility for medical image analysis by adapting to diverse spatial resolutions. However, traditional CNN-based methods are inherently ill-suited for ARSR, as they are typically designed for fixed upsampling factors. While INR-based methods overcome this limitation, they still struggle to effectively process and leverage multi-modal images with varying resolutions and details. In this paper, we propose Nexus-INR, a Diverse Knowledge-guided ARSR framework, which employs varied information and downstream tasks to achieve high-quality, adaptive-resolution medical image super-resolution. Specifically, Nexus-INR contains three key components. A dual-branch encoder with an auxiliary classification task to effectively disentangle shared anatomical structures and modality-specific features; a knowledge distillation module using cross-modal attention that guides low-resolution modality reconstruction with high-resolution reference, enhanced by self-supervised consistency loss; an integrated segmentation module that embeds anatomical semantics to improve both reconstruction quality and downstream segmentation performance. Experiments on the BraTS2020 dataset for both super-resolution and downstream segmentation demonstrate that Nexus-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics.

- **Summary**: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward 3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views, enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across various types of degradations.

- **Summary**: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness. While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic attributes.

- **Summary**: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples (UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox: users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image (noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

- **Summary**: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name, thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We will release the code publicly.

- **Summary**: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping (TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks, outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and +4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.



### Causal Disentanglement and Cross-Modal Alignment for Enhanced Few-Shot Learning

- **Summary**: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining computational efficiency. Code will be available at https://github.com/tianjiao-j/CCA.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable 3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$ faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and DTU datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term, high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components: Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing $196,262$ image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA, comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and boosts VQA accuracy from 0.74 to 0.87.

- **Summary**: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods, such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates, whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

- **Summary**: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models, particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images, simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting real fire data. The dataset is available at https://github.com/boilermakerr/FireUnitData.

- **Summary**: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced, effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices, the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image. The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps: understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3. The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop. This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence, delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts. Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

- **Summary**: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose image editing.

- **Summary**: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific, dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However, hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images, which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs' final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and tasks.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency" artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix sort overhead without quality degradation.

- **Summary**: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of each proposed component.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector (DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance while notably reducing forgetting.

- **Summary**: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus, accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR) and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism, enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally, an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information and global context, effectively mitigating interference from category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG tasks.

- **Summary**: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues, we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating privacy concerns.

- **Summary**: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models. Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore, developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code is available in the supplementary materials.

- **Summary**: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance. To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e., ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos, called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically, ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\% success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of image generation. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30% of the computational resources and 20% GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.

- **Summary**: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting) and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

- **Summary**: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However, conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets - without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines, demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations, and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis, offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

- **Summary**: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression, undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

- **Summary**: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features, our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably.

- **Summary**: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN. Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss (LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

- **Summary**: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust 3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this, we propose a Robust single-stage fully Sparse 3D object Detection Network with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations. Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference, further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art detection.

- **Summary**: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality. To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO, that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2% and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation.

- **Summary**: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2) multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines, particularly in style reproduction and content preservation.

- **Summary**: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon (i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1) inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

- **Summary**: Galaxy image translation is an important application in galaxy physics and cosmology. With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has been performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information extraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the development of image translation models for scientific use.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy, ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot semantic segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/ROUJINN/SDGPA

- **Summary**: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

- **Summary**: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD) provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods, distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level, neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation). We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

- **Summary**: We introduce Skywork UniPic, a 1.5 billion-parameter autoregressive model that unifies image understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing within a single architecture-eliminating the need for task-specific adapters or inter-module connectors-and demonstrate that compact multimodal systems can achieve state-of-the-art performance on commodity hardware. Skywork UniPic achieves a GenEval score of 0.86, surpassing most existing unified models; sets a new DPG-Bench complex-generation record of 85.5; attains 5.83 on GEditBench-EN and 3.49 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing; and generates 1024 x 1024 images with under 15 GB of GPU memory (e.g., RTX 4090). (1) a decoupled encoding strategy that leverages a masked autoregressive encoder for synthesis and a SigLIP2 encoder for understanding, all feeding a shared autoregressive decoder; (2) a progressive, resolution-aware training schedule scaling from 256 x 256 to 1024 x 1024 while dynamically unfreezing parameters to balance capacity and stability; and (3) meticulously curated, 100 million-scale datasets augmented with task-specific reward models to refine generation and editing objectives. By demonstrating that high-fidelity multimodal integration need not incur prohibitive resource demands, Skywork UniPic establishes a practical paradigm for deployable, high-fidelity multimodal AI.

- **Summary**: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding. These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based HGR.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease detection requires expensive neuroimaging or invasive procedures, limiting accessibility. This study explores whether deep learning can enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting analysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting data. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical issues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable directions for future research.

- **Summary**: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516 meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution.

- **Summary**: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL) for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning. Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments. Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated videos and comparison results are in our project page.

- **Summary**: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with minimal computational overhead.

- **Summary**: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution. Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective, still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon publication.

- **Summary**: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility, hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior, encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook. Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable convolution techniques.

- **Summary**: Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps. This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness. Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability, enables efficient generalization across diverse robotic hands, and overcomes annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping.

- **Summary**: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment. To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information. (3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving 17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

- **Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining. While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models (LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.}, limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs. However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations. Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows, conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients. Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process: first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy, and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while assuming limited-resource clients.

- **Summary**: Chest X-Ray (CXR) imaging for pulmonary diagnosis raises significant challenges, primarily because bone structures can obscure critical details necessary for accurate diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly with diffusion models, offer significant promise for effectively minimizing the visibility of bone structures in CXR images, thereby improving clarity and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, existing diffusion-based methods for bone suppression in CXR imaging struggle to balance the complete suppression of bones with preserving local texture details. Additionally, their high computational demand and extended processing time hinder their practical use in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we introduce a Global-Local Latent Consistency Model (GL-LCM) architecture. This model combines lung segmentation, dual-path sampling, and global-local fusion, enabling fast high-resolution bone suppression in CXR images. To tackle potential boundary artifacts and detail blurring in local-path sampling, we further propose Local-Enhanced Guidance, which addresses these issues without additional training. Comprehensive experiments on a self-collected dataset SZCH-X-Rays, and the public dataset JSRT, reveal that our GL-LCM delivers superior bone suppression and remarkable computational efficiency, significantly outperforming several competitive methods.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details. The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method, Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models. Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then, parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

- **Summary**: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates anatomical context.

- **Summary**: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt, which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks, thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

- **Summary**: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements. Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated characterization.

- **Summary**: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation \textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}). Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively addressing the ETTA challenge.

- **Summary**: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations, and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

- **Summary**: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51 styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks, we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications. This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV) constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery. Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

- **Summary**: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists, remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks. To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e., planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code will be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/MACT.git.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task, especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running 1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video segmentation models.

- **Summary**: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics, including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and qualitative output.

- **Summary**: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved. However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention. Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph, input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework.

- **Summary**: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy.

- **Summary**: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated, with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for classification.

- **Summary**: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image (SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality, robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative models.

- **Summary**: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis (CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling. Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism, extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and medical datasets.

- **Summary**: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus (retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture, so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in image-customized tasks. Prior works have achieved notable progress on human-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware inpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving human-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background interferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as existing datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and diverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances cannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In this work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with diverse pose variations and complex backgrounds. We then propose Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD), a novel strategy that decomposes generation into semantically separated pathways for each instance and the background. To enhance human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance, integrating pose, parsing, and spatial relations. We further present Spatially-Modulated Attention to better guide attention flow. Extensive experiments show that MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging human erasing benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

- **Summary**: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images, dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network (AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI) module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling, sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales, thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Accurate preoperative prediction of erectile dysfunction (ED) is important for counseling patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. While clinical features are established predictors, the added value of preoperative MRI remains underexplored. We investigate whether MRI provides additional predictive value for ED at 12 months post-surgery, evaluating four modeling strategies: (1) a clinical-only baseline, representing current state-of-the-art; (2) classical models using handcrafted anatomical features derived from MRI; (3) deep learning models trained directly on MRI slices; and (4) multimodal fusion of imaging and clinical inputs. Imaging-based models (maximum AUC 0.569) slightly outperformed handcrafted anatomical approaches (AUC 0.554) but fell short of the clinical baseline (AUC 0.663). Fusion models offered marginal gains (AUC 0.586) but did not exceed clinical-only performance. SHAP analysis confirmed that clinical features contributed most to predictive performance. Saliency maps from the best-performing imaging model suggested a predominant focus on anatomically plausible regions, such as the prostate and neurovascular bundles. While MRI-based models did not improve predictive performance over clinical features, our findings suggest that they try to capture patterns in relevant anatomical structures and may complement clinical predictors in future multimodal approaches.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows, yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost. Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient framework applicable to various models.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity. Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models without requiring additional fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories. Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors; (2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ, and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

- **Summary**: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

- **Summary**: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery, where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible. Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite different from the learning database.

- **Summary**: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced, multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization. Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing.

- **Summary**: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains, which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1) K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2 feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three medical datasets without any additional training compared with several conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model.

- **Summary**: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge: balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information. Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects: specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning, both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next, we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA) mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally, distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center, improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation, inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art in correct boundary matches.

- **Summary**: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore, inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/yuankaishen2001/CoEmoGen.

- **Summary**: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits, applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for statistical significance.   Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes independent of disease status or treatment effects.

- **Summary**: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized dataset will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations. Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian, drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28% vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI, with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

- **Summary**: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape. Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects. This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones, minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity: naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM, except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife density estimation.

- **Summary**: Predicting user intentions in virtual reality (VR) is crucial for creating immersive experiences, particularly in tasks involving complex grasping motions where accurate haptic feedback is essential. In this work, we leverage time-series data from hand movements to evaluate both classification and regression approaches across 810 trials with varied object types, sizes, and manipulations. Our findings reveal that classification models struggle to generalize across users, leading to inconsistent performance. In contrast, regression-based approaches, particularly those using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate more robust performance, with timing errors within 0.25 seconds and distance errors around 5-20 cm in the critical two-second window before a grasp. Despite these improvements, predicting precise hand postures remains challenging. Through a comprehensive analysis of user variability and model interpretability, we explore why certain models fail and how regression models better accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of user behavior in VR. Our results underscore the potential of machine learning models to enhance VR interactions, particularly through adaptive haptic feedback, and lay the groundwork for future advancements in real-time prediction of user actions in VR.

- **Summary**: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However, most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

- **Summary**: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6 inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co. Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25 inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the Great Famine period.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/WZH0120/SAM2-UNeXT.

- **Summary**: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving, illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy, multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26 three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals, with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021. As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification, resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

- **Summary**: Applying machine learning to real-world medical data, e.g. from hospital archives, has the potential to revolutionize disease detection in brain images. However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration; differences between the original and restored images highlight potential abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans, which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities in heterogeneous cohorts.

- **Summary**: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently, with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses (micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution. However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics. MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment (OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF) distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines, DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95 across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and autonomous systems.

- **Summary**: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery, we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water indices such as NDVI and NDWI. We employed a novel multi-stage training approach based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge, are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically unavailable or unreliable

- **Summary**: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces, built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem (facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database, significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

- **Summary**: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures. Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.

- **Summary**: We present Attention Zoom, a modular and model-agnostic spatial attention mechanism designed to improve feature extraction in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Unlike traditional attention approaches that require architecture-specific integration, our method introduces a standalone layer that spatially emphasizes high-importance regions in the input. We evaluated Attention Zoom on multiple CNN backbones using CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, showing consistent improvements in Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy. Visual analyses using Grad-CAM and spatial warping reveal that our method encourages fine-grained and diverse attention patterns. Our results confirm the effectiveness and generality of the proposed layer for improving CCNs with minimal architectural overhead.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D scene reconstruction and understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/Uni3R.

- **Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880 pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4 document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness. Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4 MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new benchmarks on an annual basis.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency, making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

- **Summary**: Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that involves a disparity between literal and intended meanings, making it challenging for sentiment analysis and other emotion-sensitive tasks. While traditional sarcasm detection methods primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The code is available at https://github.com/cp-cp/LVLM-MSA.

- **Summary**: Evaluating text-to-image generation models requires alignment with human perception, yet existing human-centric metrics are constrained by limited data coverage, suboptimal feature extraction, and inefficient loss functions. To address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1) We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating 1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images. (2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

- **Summary**: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website: https://tri-ml.github.io/omnishape

- **Summary**: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially, complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion; and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism (CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency, while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

- **Summary**: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids, overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

- **Summary**: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency: 1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals, complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100 high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments, each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and quality.

- **Summary**: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits), Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym.

- **Summary**: The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a widely used imaging device in scientific research and industrial applications. Conventional two-dimensional (2D) SEM images do not directly reveal the three-dimensional (3D) topography of micro samples, motivating the development of SEM 3D surface reconstruction methods. However, reconstruction of complex microstructures remains challenging for existing methods due to the limitations of discrete 3D representations, the need for calibration with reference samples, and shadow-induced gradient errors. Here, we introduce NFH-SEM, a neural field-based hybrid SEM 3D reconstruction method that takes multi-view, multi-detector 2D SEM images as input and fuses geometric and photometric information into a continuous neural field representation. NFH-SEM eliminates the manual calibration procedures through end-to-end self-calibration and automatically disentangles shadows from SEM images during training, enabling accurate reconstruction of intricate microstructures. We validate the effectiveness of NFH-SEM on real and simulated datasets. Our experiments show high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse, challenging samples, including two-photon lithography microstructures, peach pollen, and silicon carbide particle surfaces, demonstrating precise detail and broad applicability.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of personalized image generation technologies, concerns about forgery attacks that infringe on portrait rights and privacy are growing. To address these concerns, protection perturbation algorithms have been developed to disrupt forgery generation. However, the protection algorithms would become ineffective when forgery attackers apply purification techniques to bypass the protection. To address this issue, we present a novel approach, Anti-Tamper Perturbation (ATP). ATP introduces a tamper-proof mechanism within the perturbation. It consists of protection and authorization perturbations, where the protection perturbation defends against forgery attacks, while the authorization perturbation detects purification-based tampering. Both protection and authorization perturbations are applied in the frequency domain under the guidance of a mask, ensuring that the protection perturbation does not disrupt the authorization perturbation. This design also enables the authorization perturbation to be distributed across all image pixels, preserving its sensitivity to purification-based tampering. ATP demonstrates its effectiveness in defending forgery attacks across various attack settings through extensive experiments, providing a robust solution for protecting individuals' portrait rights and privacy.

- **Summary**: Modern 3D semantic scene graph estimation methods utilize ground truth 3D annotations to accurately predict target objects, predicates, and relationships. In the absence of given 3D ground truth representations, we explore leveraging only multi-view RGB images to tackle this task. To attain robust features for accurate scene graph estimation, we must overcome the noisy reconstructed pseudo point-based geometry from predicted depth maps and reduce the amount of background noise present in multi-view image features. The key is to enrich node and edge features with accurate semantic and spatial information and through neighboring relations. We obtain semantic masks to guide feature aggregation to filter background features and design a novel method to incorporate neighboring node information to aid robustness of our scene graph estimates. Furthermore, we leverage on explicit statistical priors calculated from the training summary statistics to refine node and edge predictions based on their one-hop neighborhood. Our experiments show that our method outperforms current methods purely using multi-view images as the initial input. Our project page is available at https://qixun1.github.io/projects/SCRSSG.

- **Summary**: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in identifying large craters with high precision.

- **Summary**: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead. Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods. We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

- **Summary**: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at different locations from different images independently as well as concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy, especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human radiologists.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open classes.

- **Summary**: This work aims to overcome an assumption of conventional MR simulators: Individual isochromats should be simulated individually. To reduce the computational times of MR simulation, a new simulation method using grouped isochromats is proposed. When multiple isochromats are grouped before simulations, some parts of the simulation can be shared in each group. For a certain gradient type, the isochromats in the group can be easily chosen for ensuring that they behave the same. For example, the group can be defined as the isochromats whose locations along x-axis, T1, T2 and magnetic field inhomogeneity values are the same values. In such groups, simulations can be combined when a pulse sequence with the magnetic field gradient along x-axis only are processed. The processing times of the conventional and proposed methods were evaluated with several sequences including fast spin echo (FSE) and echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences. The simulation times of the proposed method were 3 to 72 times faster than those of the conventional methods. In the cases of 27.5 million isochromats using single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions and multi-threading, the conventional method simulated FSE and EPI sequences in 208.4 and 66.4 seconds, respectively. In the same cases, the proposed method simulated these sequences in 38.1 and 7.1 seconds, respectively.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%. RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.
