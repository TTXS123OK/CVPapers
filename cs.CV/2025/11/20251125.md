- **Summary**: As VLMs are deployed in safety-critical applications, their ability to abstain from answering when uncertain becomes crucial for reliability, especially in Scene Text Visual Question Answering (STVQA) tasks. For example, OCR errors like misreading "50 mph" as "60 mph" could cause severe traffic accidents. This leads us to ask: Can VLMs know when they can't see? Existing abstention methods suggest pessimistic answers: they either rely on miscalibrated output probabilities or require semantic agreement unsuitable for OCR tasks. However, this failure may indicate we are looking in the wrong place: uncertainty signals could be hidden in VLMs' internal representations.   Building on this insight, we propose Latent Representation Probing (LRP): training lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns. We explore three probe designs: concatenating representations across all layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling single layer probes by majority vote. Experiments on four benchmarks across image and video modalities show LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6\% over best baselines. Our analysis reveals: probes generalize across various uncertainty sources and datasets, and optimal signals emerge from intermediate rather than final layers. This establishes a principled framework for building deployment-ready AI systems by detecting confidence signals from internal states rather than unreliable outputs.

- **Summary**: Image diversity remains a fundamental challenge for text-to-image diffusion models. Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution. At the same time, the prompt-level space provides a global semantic constraint that regulates distribution shifts, preventing quality degradation while maintaining high fidelity. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show that TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points, without sacrificing image quality. Code will be released upon acceptance.



### CropVLM: Learning to Zoom for Fine-Grained Vision-Language Perception

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with tasks that require fine-grained image understanding, such as scene-text recognition or document analysis, due to perception limitations and visual fragmentation. To address these challenges, we introduce CropVLM as an external low-cost method for boosting performance, enabling VLMs to dynamically ''zoom in'' on relevant image regions, enhancing their ability to capture fine details. CropVLM is trained using reinforcement learning, without using human-labeled bounding boxes as a supervision signal, and without expensive synthetic evaluations. The model is trained once and can be paired with both open-source and proprietary VLMs to improve their performance. Our approach delivers significant improvements on tasks that require high-resolution image understanding, notably for benchmarks that are out-of-domain for the target VLM, without modifying or fine-tuning the VLM, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting.



### ReDirector: Creating Any-Length Video Retakes with Rotary Camera Encoding

- **Comment**: Project page: https://byeongjun-park.github.io/ReDirector/
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present ReDirector, a novel camera-controlled video retake generation method for dynamically captured variable-length videos. In particular, we rectify a common misuse of RoPE in previous works by aligning the spatiotemporal positions of the input video and the target retake. Moreover, we introduce Rotary Camera Encoding (RoCE), a camera-conditioned RoPE phase shift that captures and integrates multi-view relationships within and across the input and target videos. By integrating camera conditions into RoPE, our method generalizes to out-of-distribution camera trajectories and video lengths, yielding improved dynamic object localization and static background preservation. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements in camera controllability, geometric consistency, and video quality across various trajectories and lengths.



### Inferix: A Block-Diffusion based Next-Generation Inference Engine for World Simulation

- **Summary**: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.   Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods face dual challenges of limited clinical samples and low inter-class differentiation among Diffuse Cystic Lung Diseases (DCLDs) in advancing Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) diagnosis via Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate diagnostic potential fo such rare diseases, the absence of domain-specific knowledge and referable radiological features intensify hallucination risks. To address this problem, we propose BHD-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that integrates DCLD-specific expertise and clinical precedents with MLLMs to improve BHD diagnostic accuracy. BHDRAG employs: (1) a specialized agent generating imaging manifestation descriptions of CT images to construct a multimodal corpus of DCLDs cases. (2) a cosine similarity-based retriever pinpointing relevant imagedescription pairs for query images, and (3) an MLLM synthesizing retrieved evidence with imaging data for diagnosis. BHD-RAG is validated on the dataset involving four types of DCLDs, achieving superior accuracy and generating evidence-based descriptions closely aligned with expert insights.



### Rectified SpaAttn: Revisiting Attention Sparsity for Efficient Video Generation

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformers dominate video generation, but the quadratic complexity of attention computation introduces substantial latency. Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality. We release Rectified SpaAttn as open-source at https://github.com/BienLuky/Rectified-SpaAttn .



### 4DWorldBench: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for 3D/4D World Generation Models

- **Summary**: World Generation Models are emerging as a cornerstone of next-generation multimodal intelligence systems. Unlike traditional 2D visual generation, World Models aim to construct realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds from images, videos, or text. These models not only need to produce high-fidelity visual content but also maintain coherence across space, time, physics, and instruction control, enabling applications in virtual reality, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and content creation. However, prior benchmarks emphasize different evaluation dimensions and lack a unified assessment of world-realism capability. To systematically evaluate World Models, we introduce the 4DWorldBench, which measures models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency. The benchmark covers tasks such as Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D. Beyond these, we innovatively introduce adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, which not only integrates but also extends traditional evaluation paradigms. To accommodate different modality-conditioned inputs, we map all modality conditions into a unified textual space during evaluation, and further integrate LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based methods. This unified and adaptive design enables more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence. Preliminary human studies further demonstrate that our adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments. We hope this benchmark will serve as a foundation for objective comparisons and improvements, accelerating the transition from "visual generation" to "world generation."

### Face, Whole-Person, and Object Classification in a Unified Space Via The Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum

- **Summary**: Vision foundation models can perform generalized object classification in zero-shot mode, and face/person recognition when they are fine-tuned. However, fine-tuned models suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We create models that perform four tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high- and low-quality images, and person recognition from whole-body images) in a single embedding space -- without incurring substantial catastrophic forgetting. To accomplish this, we introduce two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC): a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes a foundation backbone simultaneously on all four tasks. The IMIC method proved effective with three foundation model bases: DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02. Two of these (EVA-02 and CLIP) performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans at multi-tasking across face, body, and object datasets. Further, we demonstrate that our approach does not substantially harm out-of-distribution generalization, thus maintaining a key property of foundation models. Analysis of the most accurate model variants (EVA-02 + IMIC A and B) showed linearly separable representations of the four tasks in the unified embedding space, but with substantial sharing of features across tasks. Fewer than 100 PCs calculated from any one task could perform all other tasks with nearly zero performance degradation.



### DOGE: Differentiable Bezier Graph Optimization for Road Network Extraction

- **Summary**: Automatic extraction of road networks from aerial imagery is a fundamental task, yet prevailing methods rely on polylines that struggle to model curvilinear geometry. We maintain that road geometry is inherently curve-based and introduce the Bézier Graph, a differentiable parametric curve-based representation. The primary obstacle to this representation is to obtain the difficult-to-construct vector ground-truth (GT). We sidestep this bottleneck by reframing the task as a global optimization problem over the Bézier Graph. Our framework, DOGE, operationalizes this paradigm by learning a parametric Bézier Graph directly from segmentation masks, eliminating the need for curve GT. DOGE holistically optimizes the graph by alternating between two complementary modules: DiffAlign continuously optimizes geometry via differentiable rendering, while TopoAdapt uses discrete operators to refine its topology. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale SpaceNet and CityScale benchmarks, presenting a new paradigm for generating high-fidelity vector maps of road networks. We will release our code and related data.



### STAvatar: Soft Binding and Temporal Density Control for Monocular 3D Head Avatars Reconstruction

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Reconstructing high-fidelity and animatable 3D head avatars from monocular videos remains a challenging yet essential task. Existing methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting typically bind Gaussians to mesh triangles and model deformations solely via Linear Blend Skinning, which results in rigid motion and limited expressiveness. Moreover, they lack specialized strategies to handle frequently occluded regions (e.g., mouth interiors, eyelids). To address these limitations, we propose STAvatar, which consists of two key components: (1) a UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that leverages both image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets within the UV space. This UV representation supports dynamic resampling, ensuring full compatibility with Adaptive Density Control (ADC) and enhanced adaptability to shape and textural variations. (2) a Temporal ADC strategy, which first clusters structurally similar frames to facilitate more targeted computation of the densification criterion. It further introduces a novel fused perceptual error as clone criterion to jointly capture geometric and textural discrepancies, encouraging densification in regions requiring finer details. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAvatar achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, especially in capturing fine-grained details and reconstructing frequently occluded regions. The code will be publicly available.



### Temporal-Visual Semantic Alignment: A Unified Architecture for Transferring Spatial Priors from Vision Models to Zero-Shot Temporal Tasks

- **Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in aligning and generating content across text and image modalities. However, the potential of using non-visual, continuous sequential, as a conditioning signal for high-fidelity image generation remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, existing methods that convert series into "pseudo-images" for temporal forecasting fail to establish semantic-level alignment. In this paper, we propose TimeArtist, a temporal-visual conversion framework that pioneers semantic-level alignment between time series fluctuations and visual concepts. It pioneers a "warmup-align" paradigm: first, a dual-autoencoder and shared quantizer are self-supervised trained on large-scale datasets to learn modality-shared representations. Then, the encoders and quantizer are frozen, and a projection is introduced to align temporal and visual samples at the representation level. TimeArtist establishes a versatile cross-modal framework, enabling high-quality, diverse image generation directly from time series, while capturing temporal fluctuation patterns to render images as styles transfer. Extensive experiments show that TimeArtist achieves satisfactory performance in image generation metrics, while also attaining superior results in zero-shot temporal tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal generation, bridging the gap between temporal dynamics and visual semantics.

- **Summary**: World models are emerging as a foundational paradigm for scalable, data-efficient embodied AI. In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions. Critically, VLA model (e.g., GigaBrain-0) trained on GigaWorld-0-generated data achieve strong real-world performance, significantly improving generalization and task success on physical robots without any real-world interaction during training.

- **Summary**: Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders globally. In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level. This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources. Experiments on the DAIC-WoZ dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, paving the way for broader clinical applications beyond mental health.



### MAPS: Preserving Vision-Language Representations via Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling for Better Vision-Language-Action Generalization

- **Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models inherit strong priors from pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but naive fine-tuning often disrupts these representations and harms generalization. Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%). Our findings highlight empirically guided proximity to pretrained VLMs as a simple yet powerful principle for preserving broad generalization in VLM-to-VLA transfer.

- **Summary**: Change detection (CD) in multitemporal remote sensing imagery presents significant challenges for fine-grained recognition, owing to heterogeneity and spatiotemporal misalignment. However, existing methodologies based on vision transformers or state-space models typically disrupt local structural consistency during temporal serialization, obscuring discriminative cues under misalignment and hindering reliable change localization. To address this, we introduce ChessMamba, a structure-aware framework leveraging interleaved state-space modeling for robust CD with multi-temporal inputs. ChessMamba integrates a SpatialMamba encoder with a lightweight cross-source interaction module, featuring two key innovations: (i) Chessboard interleaving with snake scanning order, which serializes multi-temporal features into a unified sequence within a single forward pass, thereby shortening interaction paths and enabling direct comparison for accurate change localization; and (ii) Structure-aware fusion via multi-dilated convolutions, selectively capturing center-and-corner neighborhood contexts within each mono-temporal. Comprehensive evaluations on three CD tasks, including binary CD, semantic CD and multimodal building damage assessment, demonstrate that ChessMamba effectively fuses heterogeneous features and achieves substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.The relevant code will be available at: github.com/DingLei14/ChessMamba.

- **Summary**: As deep image forgery powered by AI generative models, such as GANs, continues to challenge today's digital world, detecting AI-generated forgeries has become a vital security topic. Generalizability and robustness are two critical concerns of a forgery detector, determining its reliability when facing unknown GANs and noisy samples in an open world. Although many studies focus on improving these two properties, the root causes of these problems have not been fully explored, and it is unclear if there is a connection between them. Moreover, despite recent achievements in addressing these issues from image forensic or anti-forensic aspects, a universal method that can contribute to both sides simultaneously remains practically significant yet unavailable. In this paper, we provide a fundamental explanation of these problems from a frequency perspective. Our analysis reveals that the frequency bias of a DNN forgery detector is a possible cause of generalization and robustness issues. Based on this finding, we propose a two-step frequency alignment method to remove the frequency discrepancy between real and fake images, offering double-sided benefits: it can serve as a strong black-box attack against forgery detectors in the anti-forensic context or, conversely, as a universal defense to improve detector reliability in the forensic context. We also develop corresponding attack and defense implementations and demonstrate their effectiveness, as well as the effect of the frequency alignment method, in various experimental settings involving twelve detectors, eight forgery models, and five metrics.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) has proven highly effective for compressing large models and enhancing the performance of smaller ones. However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features. We also propose a scale consistency loss to address distributional shifts between modalities, and employ a shared classifier to unify feature spaces. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show our method substantially outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD approaches.

- **Summary**: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology can assist clinicians in evaluating liver lesions and intervening with treatment in time. Although CAD technology has advanced in recent years, the application scope of existing datasets remains relatively limited, typically supporting only single tasks, which has somewhat constrained the development of CAD technology. To address the above limitation, in this paper, we construct a multi-task liver dataset (LiMT) used for liver and tumor segmentation, multi-label lesion classification, and lesion detection based on arterial phase-enhanced computed tomography (CT), potentially providing an exploratory solution that is able to explore the correlation between tasks and does not need to worry about the heterogeneity between task-specific datasets during training. The dataset includes CT volumes from 150 different cases, comprising four types of liver diseases as well as normal cases. Each volume has been carefully annotated and calibrated by experienced clinicians. This public multi-task dataset may become a valuable resource for the medical imaging research community in the future. In addition, this paper not only provides relevant baseline experimental results but also reviews existing datasets and methods related to liver-related tasks.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for scientific applications, yet open-source models still struggle with Scientific Visual Question Answering (SVQA), namely answering questions about figures from scientific papers. A key bottleneck lies in the lack of public, large-scale, high-quality SVQA datasets. Although recent work uses LVLMs to synthesize data at scale, we identify systematic errors in their resulting QA pairs, stemming from LVLMs' inherent limitations and information asymmetry between figures and text. To address these challenges, we propose a verification-centric Generate-then-Verify framework that first generates QA pairs with figure-associated textual context, then applies cross-modal consistency checks against figures along with auxiliary filters to eliminate erroneous pairs. We instantiate this framework to curate VeriSciQA, a dataset of 20,351 QA pairs spanning 20 scientific domains and 12 figure types. VeriSciQA poses a challenging benchmark for open-source models, with a substantial accuracy gap between the leading open-source models (64%) and a proprietary model (82%). Moreover, models fine-tuned on VeriSciQA achieve consistent improvements on SVQA benchmarks, with performance gains that scale with data size and surpass models trained on existing datasets. Human evaluation further validates the superior correctness of VeriSciQA. Together, these evidences demonstrate that continued data expansion by our scalable framework can further advance SVQA capability in the open-source community.

- **Summary**: Vision-language agents have achieved remarkable progress in a variety of multimodal reasoning tasks; however, their learning remains constrained by the limitations of human-annotated supervision. Recent self-rewarding approaches attempt to overcome this constraint by allowing models to act as their own critics or reward providers. Yet, purely text-based self-evaluation struggles to verify complex visual reasoning steps and often suffers from evaluation hallucinations. To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning, we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning. Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair, enabling the model to introspect, verify, and refine its reasoning through evidence-grounded analysis. It unifies two synergistic roles within a single LVLM: a Solver that performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning, and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. These roles interact through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle, where tool-based verification and reinforcement learning jointly align the reasoning and evaluation distributions for stable self-improvement. Through this zero-external-reward evolution, Agent0-VL aligns its reasoning and verification behaviors without any human annotation or external reward models, achieving continual self-improvement. Experiments on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis show that Agent0-VL achieves an 12.5% improvement over the base model.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a multimodal approach for continuous sign recognition that first uses machine learning to detect the start and end frames of signs in videos of American Sign Language (ASL) sentences, and then recognizes the segmented signs. For improved robustness, we use 3D skeletal features extracted from sign language videos to capture the convergence of sign properties and their dynamics, which tend to cluster at sign boundaries. Another focus of this work is the incorporation of information from 3D handshape for boundary detection. To detect handshapes normally expected at the beginning and end of signs, we pretrain a handshape classifier for 87 linguistically defined canonical handshape categories using a dataset that we created by integrating and normalizing several existing datasets. A multimodal fusion module is then used to unify the pretrained sign video segmentation framework and the handshape classification models. Finally, the estimated boundaries are used for sign recognition, where the recognition model is trained on a large database containing both citation-form isolated signs and signs pre-segmented (based on manual annotations) from continuous signing, as such signs often differ in certain respects. We evaluate our method on the ASLLRP corpus and demonstrate significant improvements over previous work.

- **Summary**: We present Motion Marionette, a zero-shot framework for rigid motion transfer from monocular source videos to single-view target images. Previous works typically employ geometric, generative, or simulation priors to guide the transfer process, but these external priors introduce auxiliary constraints that lead to trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. To address these limitations, we propose guiding the motion transfer process through an internal prior that exclusively captures the spatial-temporal transformations and is shared between the source video and any transferred target video. Specifically, we first lift both the source video and the target image into a unified 3D representation space. Motion trajectories are then extracted from the source video to construct a spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior that is independent of object geometry and semantics, encoding relative spatial variations over time. This prior is further integrated with the target object to synthesize a controllable velocity field, which is subsequently refined using Position-Based Dynamics to mitigate artifacts and enhance visual coherence. The resulting velocity field can be flexibly employed for efficient video production. Empirical results demonstrate that Motion Marionette generalizes across diverse objects, produces temporally consistent videos that align well with the source motion, and supports controllable video generation.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of diffusion models, a variety of fine-tuning methods have been developed, enabling high-fidelity image generation with high similarity to the target content using only 3 to 5 training images. More recently, zero-shot generation methods have emerged, capable of producing highly realistic outputs from a single reference image without altering model weights. However, technological advancements have also introduced significant risks to facial privacy. Malicious actors can exploit diffusion model customization with just a few or even one image of a person to create synthetic identities nearly identical to the original identity. Although research has begun to focus on defending against diffusion model customization, most existing defense methods target fine-tuning approaches and neglect zero-shot generation defenses. To address this issue, this paper proposes Dual-Layer Anti-Diffusion (DLADiff) to defense both fine-tuning methods and zero-shot methods. DLADiff contains a dual-layer protective mechanism. The first layer provides effective protection against unauthorized fine-tuning by leveraging the proposed Dual-Surrogate Models (DSUR) mechanism and Alternating Dynamic Fine-Tuning (ADFT), which integrates adversarial training with the prior knowledge derived from pre-fine-tuned models. The second layer, though simple in design, demonstrates strong effectiveness in preventing image generation through zero-shot methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in defending against fine-tuning of diffusion models and achieves unprecedented performance in protecting against zero-shot generation.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown strong decision-making capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing VLAs often struggle with achieving efficient inference and generalizing to novel autonomous vehicle configurations and driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose Reasoning-VLA, a general and fast action-generation VLA framework. The proposed model employs a set of learnable action queries, initialized via Gaussian sampling from ground-truth trajectories within the training corpus. These learnable queries interact with reasoning-enhanced vision-language features to generate continuous action trajectories in parallel. To promote robust generalization, we consolidate eight publicly available autonomous driving datasets into a standardized, Chain-of-Thought reasoning-based, and easy-to-use data format for model training. Leveraging both supervised learning and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, extensive empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Reasoning-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, superior generalization capability, and the excellent inference speed reported to date.

- **Summary**: We present a framework that pioneers the prediction of photochemical conversion in complex three-dimensionally printed objects, introducing a challenging new computer vision task: predicting dense, non-visual volumetric physical properties from 3D visual data. This approach leverages the largest-ever optically printed 3D specimen dataset, comprising a large family of parametrically designed complex minimal surface structures that have undergone terminal chemical characterisation. Conventional vision models are ill-equipped for this task, as they lack an inductive bias for the coupled, non-linear interactions of optical physics (diffraction, absorption) and material physics (diffusion, convection) that govern the final chemical state. To address this, we propose Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation (C-PGA), a novel multimodal fusion architecture. Unlike standard concatenation, C-PGA explicitly models physical coupling by using sparse geometrical and process parameters (e.g., surface transport, print layer height) as a Query to dynamically gate and adapt the dense visual features via feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). This mechanism spatially modulates dual 3D visual streams-extracted by parallel 3D-CNNs processing raw projection stacks and their diffusion-diffraction corrected counterparts allowing the model to recalibrate its visual perception based on the physical context. This approach offers a breakthrough in virtual chemical characterisation, eliminating the need for traditional post-print measurements and enabling precise control over the chemical conversion state.



### Scale Where It Matters: Training-Free Localized Scaling for Diffusion Models

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have become the dominant paradigm in text-to-image generation, and test-time scaling (TTS) further improves quality by allocating more computation during inference. However, existing TTS methods operate at the full-image level, overlooking the fact that image quality is often spatially heterogeneous. This leads to unnecessary computation on already satisfactory regions and insufficient correction of localized defects. In this paper, we explore a new direction - Localized TTS - that adaptively resamples defective regions while preserving high-quality regions, thereby substantially reducing the search space. This paradigm poses two central challenges: accurately localizing defects and maintaining global consistency. We propose LoTTS, the first fully training-free framework for localized TTS. For defect localization, LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts (e.g., high-quality vs. low-quality) to identify defective regions, and then refines them into coherent masks. For consistency, LoTTS perturbs only defective regions and denoises them locally, ensuring that corrections remain confined while the rest of the image remains undisturbed. Extensive experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX demonstrate that LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance: it consistently improves both local quality and global fidelity, while reducing GPU cost by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling. These findings establish localized TTS as a promising new direction for scaling diffusion models at inference time.

- **Summary**: Conventional document layout analysis (DLA) traditionally depends on empirical priors or a fixed set of learnable queries executed in a single forward pass. While sufficient for early-generation documents with a small, predetermined number of regions, this paradigm struggles with contemporary documents, which exhibit diverse element counts and increasingly complex layouts. To address challenges posed by modern documents, we present HybriDLA, a novel generative framework that unifies diffusion and autoregressive decoding within a single layer. The diffusion component iteratively refines bounding-box hypotheses, whereas the autoregressive component injects semantic and contextual awareness, enabling precise region prediction even in highly varied layouts. To further enhance detection quality, we design a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder that captures both fine-grained and high-level visual cues. This architecture elevates performance to 83.5% mean Average Precision (mAP). Extensive experiments on the DocLayNet and M$^6$Doc benchmarks demonstrate that HybriDLA sets a state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous approaches. All data and models will be made publicly available at https://yufanchen96.github.io/projects/HybriDLA.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained image retrieval, which aims to find images containing specific object components and assess their detailed states, is critical in fields like security and industrial inspection. However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs. The framework pioneers a search-enhancement paradigm via a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector first conducts efficient, high-recall component-level screening to determine component presence; then, a VLM acts as a recall-enhancement unit, performing secondary verification for components missed by the detector. This architecture directly enables two advanced capabilities: 1) State Search: Guided by task-specific prompts, the VLM refines results by verifying component existence and executing sophisticated state judgments (e.g., "sun visor lowered"), allowing retrieval based on component state. 2) Zero-shot Search: The framework leverages the VLM's inherent zero-shot capability to recognize and retrieve images containing unseen components or attributes (e.g., "driver wearing a mask") without any task-specific training. Experiments on a vehicle component dataset show DetVLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall retrieval accuracy of 94.82\%, significantly outperforming detection-only baselines. It also attains 94.95\% accuracy in zero-shot search for driver mask-wearing and over 90\% average accuracy in state search tasks.

- **Summary**: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown significant advancements in video understanding, especially in feature alignment, event reasoning, and instruction-following tasks. However, their capability for counterfactual reasoning, inferring alternative outcomes under hypothetical conditions, remains underexplored. This capability is essential for robust video understanding, as it requires identifying underlying causal structures and reasoning about unobserved possibilities, rather than merely recognizing observed patterns. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels. Dataset and code will be further released.

- **Summary**: One-stream Transformer-based trackers have demonstrated remarkable performance by concatenating template and search region tokens, thereby enabling joint attention across all tokens. However, enabling an excessive proportion of background search tokens to attend to the target template tokens weakens the tracker's discriminative capability. Several token pruning methods have been proposed to mitigate background interference; however, they often remove tokens near the target, leading to the loss of essential contextual information and degraded tracking performance. Moreover, the presence of distractors within the search tokens further reduces the tracker's ability to accurately identify the target. To address these limitations, we propose CPDATrack, a novel tracking framework designed to suppress interference from background and distractor tokens while enhancing computational efficiency. First, a learnable module is integrated between two designated encoder layers to estimate the probability of each search token being associated with the target. Based on these estimates, less-informative background tokens are pruned from the search region while preserving the contextual cues surrounding the target. To further suppress background interference, a discriminative selective attention mechanism is employed that fully blocks search-to-template attention in the early layers. In the subsequent encoder layers, high-probability target tokens are selectively extracted from a localized region to attend to the template tokens, thereby reducing the influence of background and distractor tokens. The proposed CPDATrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly on GOT-10k, where it attains an average overlap of 75.1 percent.

- **Summary**: Image diffusion models, though originally developed for image generation, implicitly capture rich semantic structures that enable various recognition and localization tasks beyond synthesis. In this work, we investigate their self-attention maps can be reinterpreted as semantic label propagation kernels, providing robust pixel-level correspondences between relevant image regions. Extending this mechanism across frames yields a temporal propagation kernel that enables zero-shot object tracking via segmentation in videos. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of test-time optimization strategies-DDIM inversion, textual inversion, and adaptive head weighting-in adapting diffusion features for robust and consistent label propagation. Building on these findings, we introduce DRIFT, a framework for object tracking in videos leveraging a pretrained image diffusion model with SAM-guided mask refinement, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: High-resolution content creation is rapidly emerging as a central challenge in both the vision and graphics communities. While images serve as the most fundamental modality for visual expression, content generation that aligns with the user intent requires effective, controllable high-resolution image manipulation mechanisms. However, existing approaches remain limited to low-resolution settings, typically supporting only up to 1K resolution. In this work, we introduce the task of high-resolution image editing and propose a test-time optimization framework to address it. Our method performs patch-wise optimization on high-resolution source images, followed by a fine-grained detail transfer module and a novel synchronization strategy to maintain consistency across patches. Extensive experiments show that our method produces high-quality edits, facilitating the way toward high-resolution content creation.

- **Summary**: Accurate nuclear instance segmentation is a pivotal task in computational pathology, supporting data-driven clinical insights and facilitating downstream translational applications. While large vision foundation models have shown promise for zero-shot biomedical segmentation, most existing approaches still depend on dense supervision and computationally expensive fine-tuning. Consequently, training-free methods present a compelling research direction, yet remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce SPROUT, a fully training- and annotation-free prompting framework for nuclear instance segmentation. SPROUT leverages histology-informed priors to construct slide-specific reference prototypes that mitigate domain gaps. These prototypes progressively guide feature alignment through a partial optimal transport scheme. The resulting foreground and background features are transformed into positive and negative point prompts, enabling the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to produce precise nuclear delineations without any parameter updates. Extensive experiments across multiple histopathology benchmarks demonstrate that SPROUT achieves competitive performance without supervision or retraining, establishing a novel paradigm for scalable, training-free nuclear instance segmentation in pathology.

- **Summary**: 3D face recognition offers a robust biometric solution by capturing facial geometry, providing resilience to variations in illumination, pose changes, and presentation attacks. Its strong spoof resistance makes it suitable for high-security applications, but protecting stored biometric templates remains critical. We present GFT-GCN, a privacy-preserving 3D face recognition framework that combines spectral graph learning with diffusion-based template protection. Our approach integrates the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to extract compact, discriminative spectral features from 3D face meshes. To secure these features, we introduce a spectral diffusion mechanism that produces irreversible, renewable, and unlinkable templates. A lightweight client-server architecture ensures that raw biometric data never leaves the client device. Experiments on the BU-3DFE and FaceScape datasets demonstrate high recognition accuracy and strong resistance to reconstruction attacks. Results show that GFT-GCN effectively balances privacy and performance, offering a practical solution for secure 3D face authentication.

- **Summary**: Despite decades of progress, a truly input-size agnostic visual encoder-a fundamental characteristic of human vision-has remained elusive. We address this limitation by proposing \textbf{MambaEye}, a novel, causal sequential encoder that leverages the low complexity and causal-process based pure Mamba2 backbone. Unlike previous Mamba-based vision encoders that often employ bidirectional processing, our strictly unidirectional approach preserves the inherent causality of State Space Models, enabling the model to generate a prediction at any point in its input sequence. A core innovation is our use of relative move embedding, which encodes the spatial shift between consecutive patches, providing a strong inductive bias for translation invariance and making the model inherently adaptable to arbitrary image resolutions and scanning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a novel diffusion-inspired loss function that provides dense, step-wise supervision, training the model to build confidence as it gathers more visual evidence. We demonstrate that MambaEye exhibits robust performance across a wide range of image resolutions, especially at higher resolutions such as $1536^2$ on the ImageNet-1K classification task. This feat is achieved while maintaining linear time and memory complexity relative to the number of patches.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capability in generating high-quality images for simple prompts. However, when confronted with complex prompts involving multiple objects and hierarchical structures, existing models struggle to accurately follow instructions, leading to issues such as concept omission, confusion, and poor compositionality. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Compositional Generative framework (HiCoGen) built upon a novel Chain of Synthesis (CoS) paradigm. Instead of monolithic generation, HiCoGen first leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose complex prompts into minimal semantic units. It then synthesizes these units iteratively, where the image generated in each step provides crucial visual context for the next, ensuring all textual concepts are faithfully constructed into the final scene. To further optimize this process, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Crucially, we identify that the limited exploration of standard diffusion samplers hinders effective RL. We theoretically prove that sample diversity is maximized by concentrating stochasticity in the early generation stages and, based on this insight, propose a novel Decaying Stochasticity Schedule to enhance exploration. Our RL algorithm is then guided by a hierarchical reward mechanism that jointly evaluates the image at the global, subject, and relationship levels. We also construct HiCoPrompt, a new text-to-image benchmark with hierarchical prompts for rigorous evaluation. Experiments show our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both concept coverage and compositional accuracy.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing dynamic 4D scenes is challenging, as it requires robust disentanglement of dynamic objects from the static background. While 3D foundation models like VGGT provide accurate 3D geometry, their performance drops markedly when moving objects dominate. Existing 4D approaches often rely on external priors, heavy post-optimization, or require fine-tuning on 4D datasets. In this paper, we propose VGGT4D, a training-free framework that extends the 3D foundation model VGGT for robust 4D scene reconstruction. Our approach is motivated by the key finding that VGGT's global attention layers already implicitly encode rich, layer-wise dynamic cues. To obtain masks that decouple static and dynamic elements, we mine and amplify global dynamic cues via gram similarity and aggregate them across a temporal window. To further sharpen mask boundaries, we introduce a refinement strategy driven by projection gradient. We then integrate these precise masks into VGGT's early-stage inference, effectively mitigating motion interference in both pose estimation and geometric reconstruction. Across six datasets, our method achieves superior performance in dynamic object segmentation, camera pose estimation, and dense reconstruction. It also supports single-pass inference on sequences longer than 500 frames.

- **Summary**: Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an effective approach to incentivizing reasoning capability in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), while the underlying mechanisms behind this post-training paradigm are poorly understood. We begin by exploring how input activations are affected by RLVR through the perspective of logit lens. Our systematic investigations across multiple post-trained LMMs suggest that RLVR shifts low-entropy activations unexpectedly, while high-entropy ones are less affected. We further demonstrate that such phenomena are associated with LMM reasoning by controlled experiments, suggesting a potentially beneficial role of modulating low-entropy activations. To this end, we propose Activation Replay, a novel simple yet effective training-free approach that boosts multimodal reasoning of post-trained LMMs without requiring expensive policy optimization. Our design involves manipulation of visual tokens at test time, replaying low-entropy activations from the input context of base LMMs to regulating the RLVR counterparts. Activation Replay triggers better reasoning across diverse scenarios, including mathematics, o3-like visual agents, and video reasoning. We further show that Activation Replay boosts Pass@K and mitigates narrower reasoning coverage of RLVR. Our design is compared against alternative choices, such as replaying high-entropy activations instead of low-entropy ones, or direct cross-model intervention instead of manipulating input tokens, demonstrating the superiority of our implementation. Codes will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Continuous emotional image generation (C-EICG) is emerging rapidly due to its ability to produce images aligned with both user descriptions and continuous emotional values. However, existing approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images, limiting the control of emotional continuity. Additionally, their simple alignment between emotions and naively generated texts fails to adaptively adjust emotional prompts according to image content, leading to insufficient emotional fidelity. To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback$^2$) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates high-quality images with the desired emotions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in our custom dataset. The code and dataset will be released soon.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel training-free method for inpainting with off-the-shelf text-to-image models. While guidance-based methods in theory allow generic models to be used for inverse problems such as inpainting, in practice, their effectiveness is limited, leading to the necessity of specialized inpainting-specific models. In this work, we argue that the missing ingredient for training-free inpainting is the optimization (guidance) of the initial seed noise. We propose to optimize the initial seed noise to approximately match the unmasked parts of the data - with as few as a few tens of optimization steps. We then apply conventional training-free inpainting methods on top of our optimized initial seed noise. Critically, we propose two core ideas to effectively implement this idea: (i) to avoid the costly unrolling required to relate the initial noise and the generated outcome, we perform linear approximation; and (ii) to stabilize the optimization, we optimize the initial seed noise in the spectral domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various inpainting tasks, outperforming the state of the art. Project page: https://ubc-vision.github.io/sonic/

- **Summary**: Sparsity is essential for deploying large models on resource constrained edge platforms. However, optimizing sparsity patterns for individual tasks in isolation ignores the significant I/O overhead incurred during frequent task switching. We introduce an on-demand multi-task sparsity framework specifically designed to minimize switching costs by maximizing parameter reuse. Unlike monolithic approaches, we decompose weights into reusable block-granular units and align sparse structures across tasks to maximize overlap. By dynamically loading only the small differential set of blocks required for the next task, our method effectively mitigates the cold-start latency inherent in traditional monolithic approaches.Experiments on a real-world autonomous driving platform demonstrate that our framework achieves superior switching efficiency, accelerating task switching by over 6.6X on average compared to existing sparsity methods.

- **Summary**: Predicting gaze behavior in virtual reality environments remains a significant challenge with implications for rendering optimization and interface design. This paper introduces a multimodal approach to VR gaze prediction that combines temporal gaze patterns, head movement data, and visual scene information. By leveraging a gated fusion mechanism with cross-modal attention, the approach learns to adaptively weight gaze history, head movement, and scene content based on contextual relevance. Evaluations using a dataset spanning 22 VR scenes with 5.3M gaze samples demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy when combining modalities compared to using individual data streams alone. The results indicate that integrating past gaze trajectories with head orientation and scene content enhances prediction accuracy across 1-3 future frames. Cross-scene generalization testing shows consistent performance with 93.1% validation accuracy and temporal consistency in predicted gaze trajectories. These findings contribute to understanding attention mechanisms in virtual environments while suggesting potential applications in rendering optimization, interaction design, and user experience evaluation. The approach represents a step toward more efficient virtual reality systems that can anticipate user attention patterns without requiring expensive eye tracking hardware.

- **Summary**: Reference-guided image generation has progressed rapidly, yet current diffusion models still struggle to preserve fine-grained visual details when refining a generated image using a reference. This limitation arises because VAE-based latent compression inherently discards subtle texture information, causing identity- and attribute-specific cues to vanish. Moreover, post-editing approaches that amplify local details based on existing methods often produce results inconsistent with the original image in terms of lighting, texture, or shape. To address this, we introduce \ourMthd{}, a detail-aware refinement framework that performs two consecutive stages of reference-driven correction to enhance pixel-level consistency. We first adapt a single-image diffusion editor by fine-tuning it to jointly ingest the draft image and the reference image, enabling globally coherent refinement while maintaining structural fidelity. We then apply reinforcement learning to further strengthen localized editing capability, explicitly optimizing for detail accuracy and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ourMthd{} significantly improves reference alignment and fine-grained detail preservation, producing faithful and visually coherent edits that surpass both open-source and commercial models on challenging reference-guided restoration benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

- **Summary**: Creativity is a complex phenomenon. When it comes to representing and assessing creativity, treating it as a single undifferentiated quantity would appear naive and underwhelming. In this work, we learn the \emph{first type-specific creativity reward model}, coined CREward, which spans three creativity ``axes," geometry, material, and texture, to allow us to view creativity through the lens of the image formation pipeline. To build our reward model, we first conduct a human benchmark evaluation to capture human perception of creativity for each type across various creative images. We then analyze the correlation between human judgments and predictions by large vision-language models (LVLMs), confirming that LVLMs exhibit strong alignment with human perception. Building on this observation, we collect LVLM-generated labels to train our CREward model that is applicable to both evaluation and generation of creative images. We explore three applications of CREward: creativity assessment, explainable creativity, and creative sample acquisition for both human design inspiration and guiding creative generation through low-rank adaptation.

- **Summary**: Conventional adversarial attacks focus on manipulating a single decision of neural networks. However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.   This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying "non-motorized lane" signs as "motorized lane" and "pedestrian" as "plastic bag".   To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs. We overcome optimization challenges by developing an effective algorithm, which searches for perturbations in normalized space with a semantic separation strategy. To evaluate the practical threat of SAUPs, we present RIST, a new real-world image dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations. Extensive experiments on three multimodal large language models demonstrate their vulnerability, achieving a 70% attack success rate when controlling five distinct targets using just an adversarial frame.

- **Summary**: Conventional radar segmentation research has typically focused on learning category labels for different moving objects. Although fundamental differences between radar and optical sensors lead to differences in the reliability of predicting accurate and consistent category labels, a review of common radar perception tasks in automotive reveals that determining whether an object is moving or static is a prerequisite for most tasks. To fill this gap, this study proposes a neural network based solution that can simultaneously segment static and moving objects from radar point clouds. Furthermore, since the measured radial velocity of static objects is correlated with the motion of the radar, this approach can also estimate the instantaneous 2D velocity of the moving platform or vehicle (ego motion). However, despite performing dual tasks, the proposed method employs very simple yet effective building blocks for feature extraction: multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In addition to being the first of its kind in the literature, the proposed method also demonstrates the feasibility of extracting the information required for the dual task directly from unprocessed point clouds, without the need for cloud aggregation, Doppler compensation, motion compensation, or any other intermediate signal processing steps. To measure its performance, this study introduces a set of novel evaluation metrics and tests the proposed method using a challenging real world radar dataset, RadarScenes. The results show that the proposed method not only performs well on the dual tasks, but also has broad application potential in other radar perception tasks.

- **Summary**: This work investigates the zero-shot forecasting capability of time-series foundation models for Leaf Area Index (LAI) forecasting in agricultural monitoring. Using the HiQ dataset (U.S., 2000-2022), we systematically compare statistical baselines, a fully supervised LSTM, and the Sundial foundation model under multiple evaluation protocols. We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning. These results highlight the strong potential of pretrained time-series foundation models to serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications.

- **Summary**: Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is essential for the deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban environments. Ideal prediction provides AVs with critical environmental cues, thereby reducing the risk of pedestrian-related collisions. However, the prediction task is challenging due to the diverse nature of pedestrian behavior and its dependence on multiple contextual factors. This paper proposes a multimodal fusion network that leverages seven modality features from both visual and motion branches, aiming to effectively extract and integrate complementary cues across different modalities. Specifically, motion and visual features are extracted from the raw inputs using multiple Transformer-based extraction modules. Depth-guided attention module leverages depth information to guide attention towards salient regions in another modality through comprehensive spatial feature interactions. To account for the varying importance of different modalities and frames, modality attention and temporal attention are designed to selectively emphasize informative modalities and effectively capture temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on the JAAD dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, achieving superior performance compared to the baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is essential for autonomous vehicles to improve pedestrian safety and reduce traffic accidents. However, accurate pedestrian intention prediction in urban environments remains challenging due to the multitude of factors affecting pedestrian behavior. In this paper, we propose a multi-context fusion Transformer (MFT) that leverages diverse numerical contextual attributes across four key dimensions, encompassing pedestrian behavior context, environmental context, pedestrian localization context and vehicle motion context, to enable accurate pedestrian intention prediction. MFT employs a progressive fusion strategy, where mutual intra-context attention enables reciprocal interactions within each context, thereby facilitating feature sequence fusion and yielding a context token as a context-specific representation. This is followed by mutual cross-context attention, which integrates features across contexts with a global CLS token serving as a compact multi-context representation. Finally, guided intra-context attention refines context tokens within each context through directed interactions, while guided cross-context attention strengthens the global CLS token to promote multi-context fusion via guided information propagation, yielding deeper and more efficient integration. Experimental results validate the superiority of MFT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 73%, 93%, and 90% on the JAADbeh, JAADall, and PIE datasets, respectively. Extensive ablation studies are further conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the network architecture and contribution of different input context.

- **Summary**: Predicting pedestrian crossing intention is crucial for autonomous vehicles to prevent pedestrian-related collisions. However, effectively extracting and integrating complementary cues from different types of data remains one of the major challenges. This paper proposes an attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer (ACIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. ACIT leverages six visual and motion modalities, which are grouped into three interaction pairs: (1) Global semantic map and global optical flow, (2) Local RGB image and local optical flow, and (3) Ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian's bounding box. Within each visual interaction pair, a dual-path attention mechanism enhances salient regions within the primary modality through intra-modal self-attention and facilitates deep interactions with the auxiliary modality (i.e., optical flow) via optical flow-guided attention. Within the motion interaction pair, cross-modal attention is employed to model the cross-modal dynamics, enabling the effective extraction of complementary motion features. Beyond pairwise interactions, a multi-modal feature fusion module further facilitates cross-modal interactions at each time step. Furthermore, a Transformer-based temporal feature aggregation module is introduced to capture sequential dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that ACIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 70% and 89% on the JAADbeh and JAADall datasets, respectively. Extensive ablation studies are further conducted to investigate the contribution of different modules of ACIT.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong understanding of driving scenes, drawing interest in their application to autonomous driving. However, high-level reasoning in safety-critical scenarios, where avoiding one traffic risk can create another, remains a major challenge. Such reasoning is often infeasible with only a single front view and requires a comprehensive view of the environment, which we achieve through multi-view inputs. We define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task that leverages multi-view inputs to address this challenge. Then, we distill Safety-Critical Reasoning into two stages: first resolve the immediate risk, then mitigate the decision-induced downstream risks. To support this, we introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios. The dataset includes multiple-choice and open-ended formats across both image and video modalities. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs underperform in safety-critical scenarios compared to normal scenes, but fine-tuning with WaymoQA significantly improves their reasoning ability, highlighting the effectiveness of our dataset in developing safer and more reasoning-capable driving agents.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment and recognize objects universally. Trained on extensive high-quality segmentation data, the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable universal segmentation capabilities, offering valuable support for OVSS. Although previous methods have made progress in leveraging SAM for OVSS, there are still some challenges: (1) SAM's tendency to over-segment and (2) hard combinations between fixed masks and labels. This paper introduces a novel mask-injected framework, SAM-MI, which effectively integrates SAM with OVSS models to address these challenges. Initially, SAM-MI employs a Text-guided Sparse Point Prompter to sample sparse prompts for SAM instead of previous dense grid-like prompts, thus significantly accelerating the mask generation process. The framework then introduces Shallow Mask Aggregation (SMAgg) to merge partial masks to mitigate the SAM's over-segmentation issue. Finally, Decoupled Mask Injection (DMI) incorporates SAM-generated masks for guidance at low-frequency and high-frequency separately, rather than directly combining them with labels. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of SAM-MI. Notably, the proposed method achieves a 16.7% relative improvement in mIoU over Grounded-SAM on the MESS benchmark, along with a 1.6$\times$ speedup. We hope SAM-MI can serve as an alternative methodology to effectively equip the OVSS model with SAM.

- **Summary**: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

- **Summary**: Visual attention serves as the primary mechanism through which MLLMs interpret visual information; however, its limited localization capability often leads to hallucinations. We observe that although MLLMs can accurately extract visual semantics from visual tokens, they fail to fully leverage this advantage during subsequent inference. To address this limitation, we propose Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method that first constructs precise visual grounding by exploiting the semantic content of visual tokens, and then uses this grounding to guide the model's focus toward relevant visual regions. In image captioning, VGA further refines this guidance dynamically during generation by suppressing regions that have already been described. In VGA, each token undergoes only a single forward pass, introducing a negligible latency overhead of just 4.36\%. In addition, VGA is fully compatible with efficient attention implementations such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and multiple hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance. Further analysis confirms that explicit visual guidance plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs.

- **Summary**: Image vectorization aims to convert raster images into editable, scalable vector representations while preserving visual fidelity. Existing vectorization methods struggle to represent complex real-world images, often producing fragmented shapes at the cost of semantic conciseness. In this paper, we propose COVec, an illumination-aware vectorization framework inspired by the Clair-Obscur principle of light-shade contrast. COVec is the first to introduce intrinsic image decomposition in the vector domain, separating an image into albedo, shade, and light layers in a unified vector representation. A semantic-guided initialization and two-stage optimization refine these layers with differentiable rendering. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that COVec achieves higher visual fidelity and significantly improved editability compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: In recent years, point cloud generation has gained significant attention in 3D generative modeling. Among existing approaches, point-based methods directly generate point clouds without relying on other representations such as latent features, meshes, or voxels. These methods offer low training cost and algorithmic simplicity, but often underperform compared to representation-based approaches. In this paper, we propose MFM-Point, a multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation that substantially improves the scalability and performance of point-based methods while preserving their simplicity and efficiency. Our multi-scale generation algorithm adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, enhancing generation quality and scalability without incurring additional training or inference overhead. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework lies in preserving the geometric structure of unordered point clouds while ensuring smooth and consistent distributional transitions across resolutions. To address this, we introduce a structured downsampling and upsampling strategy that preserves geometry and maintains alignment between coarse and fine resolutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that MFM-Point achieves best-in-class performance among point-based methods and challenges the best representation-based methods. In particular, MFM-point demonstrates strong results in multi-category and high-resolution generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Planetary remote sensing images are affected by diverse and unknown degradations caused by imaging environments and hardware constraints. These factors limit image quality and hinder supervised blind super-resolution due to the lack of ground-truth images. This work presents History-Augmented Contrastive Blind Super-Resolution (HACBSR), an unsupervised framework for blind super-resolution that operates without ground-truth images and external kernel priors. HACBSR comprises two components: (1) a contrastive kernel sampling mechanism with kernel similarity control to mitigate distribution bias from Gaussian sampling, and (2) a history-augmented contrastive learning that uses historical models to generate negative samples to enable less greedy optimization and to induce strong convexity without ground-truth. A convergence analysis of the history-augmented contrastive learning is given in the Appendix. To support evaluation in planetary applications, we introduce Ceres-50, a dataset with diverse geological features simulated degradation patterns. Experiments show that HACBSR achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods across multiple upscaling factors. The code is available at https://github.com/2333repeat/HACBSR, and the dataset is available at https://github.com/2333repeat/Ceres-50.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation serves as a key task in the development of endoscopic navigation systems. However, performance degradation persists due to uneven illumination inherent in endoscopic images, particularly in low-intensity regions. Existing low-light enhancement techniques fail to effectively guide the depth network. Furthermore, solutions from other fields, like autonomous driving, require well-lit images, making them unsuitable and increasing data collection burdens. To this end, we present DeLight-Mono - a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework with illumination decoupling. Specifically, endoscopic images are represented by a designed illumination-reflectance-depth model, and are decomposed with auxiliary networks. Moreover, a self-supervised joint-optimizing framework with novel losses leveraging the decoupled components is proposed to mitigate the effects of uneven illumination on depth estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed methods was rigorously verified through extensive comparisons and an ablation study performed on two public datasets.

- **Summary**: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

- **Summary**: Point cloud compression methods jointly optimize bitrates and reconstruction distortion. However, balancing compression ratio and reconstruction quality is difficult because low-frequency and high-frequency components contribute differently at the same resolution. To address this, we propose FLaTEC, a frequency-aware compression model that enables the compression of a full scan with high compression ratios. Our approach introduces a frequency-aware mechanism that decouples low-frequency structures and high-frequency textures, while hybridizing latent triplanes as a compact proxy for point cloud. Specifically, we convert voxelized embeddings into triplane representations to reduce sparsity, computational cost, and storage requirements. We then devise a frequency-disentangling technique that extracts compact low-frequency content while collecting high-frequency details across scales. The decoupled low-frequency and high-frequency components are stored in binary format. During decoding, full-spectrum signals are progressively recovered via a modulation block. Additionally, to compensate for the loss of 3D correlation, we introduce an efficient frequency-based attention mechanism that fosters local connectivity and outputs arbitrary resolution points. Our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and outperforms the standard codecs by 78\% and 94\% in BD-rate on both SemanticKITTI and Ford datasets.

- **Summary**: Autoregressive (AR) image generation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for image synthesis. Leveraging the generation principle of large language models, they allow for efficiently generating deceptively real-looking images, further increasing the need for reliable detection methods. However, to date there is a lack of work specifically targeting the detection of images generated by AR image generators. In this work, we present PRADA (Probability-Ratio-Based Attribution and Detection of Autoregressive-Generated Images), a simple and interpretable approach that can reliably detect AR-generated images and attribute them to their respective source model. The key idea is to inspect the ratio of a model's conditional and unconditional probability for the autoregressive token sequence representing a given image. Whenever an image is generated by a particular model, its probability ratio shows unique characteristics which are not present for images generated by other models or real images. We exploit these characteristics for threshold-based attribution and detection by calibrating a simple, model-specific score function. Our experimental evaluation shows that PRADA is highly effective against eight class-to-image and four text-to-image models.

- **Summary**: Learning procedural-aware video representations is a key step towards building agents that can reason about and execute complex tasks. Existing methods typically address this problem by aligning visual content with textual descriptions at the task and step levels to inject procedural semantics into video representations. However, due to their high level of abstraction, 'task' and 'step' descriptions fail to form a robust alignment with the concrete, observable details in visual data. To address this, we introduce 'states', i.e., textual snapshots of object configurations, as a visually-grounded semantic layer that anchors abstract procedures to what a model can actually see. We formalize this insight in a novel Task-Step-State (TSS) framework, where tasks are achieved via steps that drive transitions between observable states. To enforce this structure, we propose a progressive pre-training strategy that unfolds the TSS hierarchy, forcing the model to ground representations in states while associating them with steps and high-level tasks. Extensive experiments on the COIN and CrossTask datasets show that our method outperforms baseline models on multiple downstream tasks, including task recognition, step recognition, and next step prediction. Ablation studies show that introducing state supervision is a key driver of performance gains across all tasks. Additionally, our progressive pretraining strategy proves more effective than standard joint training, as it better enforces the intended hierarchical structure.

- **Summary**: Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI enables molecular-level visualization of low-concentration metabolites by leveraging proton exchange dynamics. However, its clinical translation is hindered by inherent challenges: spatially varying noise arising from hardware limitations, and complex imaging protocols introduce heteroscedasticity in CEST data, perturbing the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping such as amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Traditional denoising methods are not designed for this complex noise and often alter the underlying information that is critical for biomedical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method. BALD exploits the self-similar nature of CEST data to derive an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform that equalizes the noise distributions across CEST pixels without prior knowledge of noise characteristics. Then, BALD performs two-stage denoising on a linear transformation of data to disentangle molecular signals from noise. A local SVD decomposition is used as a linear transform to prevent spatial and spectral denoising artifacts. We conducted extensive validation experiments on multiple phantoms and \textit{in vivo} CEST scans. In these experiments, BALD consistently outperformed state-of-the-art CEST denoisers in both denoising metrics and downstream tasks such as molecular concentration maps estimation and cancer detection.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) has gained significant attention due to its ability to identify anomalous images using only normal images during training. Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image. However, although these visual explanations can be helpful, they lack a direct and semantically meaningful interpretation for users. To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples. Our approach, Concept-Aware Visual Anomaly Detection (CONVAD), achieves performance comparable to classic VAD methods while providing richer, concept-driven explanations that enhance interpretability and trust in VAD systems.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in world models, which primarily aim to capture the spatio-temporal correlations between an agent's actions and the evolving environment. However, existing approaches often suffer from tight runtime coupling or depend on offline reward signals, resulting in substantial inference overhead or hindering end-to-end optimization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WPT, a World-to-Policy Transfer training paradigm that enables online distillation under the guidance of an end-to-end world model. Specifically, we develop a trainable reward model that infuses world knowledge into a teacher policy by aligning candidate trajectories with the future dynamics predicted by the world model. Subsequently, we propose policy distillation and world reward distillation to transfer the teacher's reasoning ability into a lightweight student policy, enhancing planning performance while preserving real-time deployability. Extensive experiments on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks show that our WPT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a simple policy architecture: it attains a 0.11 collision rate (open-loop) and achieves a 79.23 driving score (closed-loop) surpassing both world-model-based and imitation-learning methods in accuracy and safety. Moreover, the student sustains up to 4.9x faster inference, while retaining most of the gains.

- **Summary**: There have been many recent developments in the use of Deep Learning Neural Networks for fire detection. In this paper, we explore an early warning system for detection of forest fires. Due to the lack of sizeable datasets and models tuned for this task, existing methods suffer from missed detection. In this work, we first propose a dataset for early identification of forest fires through visual analysis. Unlike existing image corpuses that contain images of wide-spread fire, our dataset consists of multiple instances of smoke plumes and fire that indicates the initiation of fire. We obtained this dataset synthetically by utilising game simulators such as Red Dead Redemption 2. We also combined our dataset with already published images to obtain a more comprehensive set. Finally, we compared image classification and localisation methods on the proposed dataset. More specifically we used YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once) and different models of detection transformer.

- **Summary**: The healthcare industry has been revolutionized significantly by novel imaging technologies, not just in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases but also by the visualization of structural abnormalities like cardiomegaly. This article explains an integrated approach to the use of deep learning tools and attention mechanisms for automatic detection of cardiomegaly using X-ray images. The initiation of the project is grounded on a strong Data Collection phase and gathering the data of annotated X-ray images of various types. Then, while the Preprocessing module fine-tunes image quality, it is feasible to utilize the best out of the data quality in the proposed system. In our proposed system, the process is a CNN configuration leveraging the inception V3 model as one of the key blocks. Besides, we also employ a multilayer attention mechanism to enhance the strength. The most important feature of the method is the multi-head attention mechanism that can learn features automatically. By exact selective focusing on only some regions of input, the model can thus identify cardiomegaly in a sensitive manner. Attention rating is calculated, duplicated, and applied to enhance representation of main data, and therefore there is a successful diagnosis. The Evaluation stage will be extremely strict and it will thoroughly evaluate the model based on such measures as accuracy and precision. This will validate that the model can identify cardiomegaly and will also show the clinical significance of this method. The model has accuracy of 95.6, precision of 95.2, recall of 96.2, sensitivity of 95.7, specificity of 96.1 and an Area Under Curve(AUC) of 96.0 and their respective graphs are plotted for visualisation.

- **Summary**: Lung cancer risk estimation is gaining increasing importance as more countries introduce population-wide screening programs using low-dose CT (LDCT). As imaging volumes grow, scalable methods that can process entire lung volumes efficiently are essential to tap into the full potential of these large screening datasets. Existing approaches either over-rely on pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability, or analyze the lung in fragments, weakening performance. We present LungEvaty, a fully transformer-based framework for predicting 1-6 year lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan. The model operates on whole-lung inputs, learning directly from large-scale screening data to capture comprehensive anatomical and pathological cues relevant for malignancy risk. Using only imaging data and no region supervision, LungEvaty matches state-of-the-art performance, refinable by an optional Anatomically Informed Attention Guidance (AIAG) loss that encourages anatomically focused attention. In total, LungEvaty was trained on more than 90,000 CT scans, including over 28,000 for fine-tuning and 6,000 for evaluation. The framework offers a simple, data-efficient, and fully open-source solution that provides an extensible foundation for future research in longitudinal and multimodal lung cancer risk prediction.

- **Summary**: Despite advances, video diffusion transformers still struggle to generalize beyond their training length, a challenge we term video length extrapolation. We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation. Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from 2x to 4x. Remarkably, it improves Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233% and 40.5% over the previous best method at 4x extrapolation. Furthermore, our method generalizes seamlessly to downstream tasks such as controllable video synthesis and editing.

- **Summary**: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is essential in oncology, yet the rapid expansion of scanners has outpaced the availability of trained specialists, making automated PET/CT report generation (PETRG) increasingly important for reducing clinical workload. Compared with structural imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI), functional PET poses distinct challenges: metabolic patterns vary with tracer physiology, and whole-body 3D contextual information is required rather than local-region interpretation. To advance PETRG, we propose PETRG-3D, an end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework that separately encodes PET and CT volumes and incorporates style-adaptive prompts to mitigate inter-hospital variability in reporting practices. We construct PETRG-Lym, a multi-center lymphoma dataset collected from four hospitals (824 reports w/ 245,509 paired PET/CT slices), and construct AutoPET-RG-Lym, a publicly accessible PETRG benchmark derived from open imaging data but equipped with new expert-written, clinically validated reports (135 cases). To assess clinical utility, we introduce PETRG-Score, a lymphoma-specific evaluation protocol that jointly measures metabolic and structural findings across curated anatomical regions. Experiments show that PETRG-3D substantially outperforms existing methods on both natural language metrics (e.g., +31.49\% ROUGE-L) and clinical efficacy metrics (e.g., +8.18\% PET-All), highlighting the benefits of volumetric dual-modality modeling and style-aware prompting. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for future PET/CT-specific models emphasizing disease-aware reasoning and clinically reliable evaluation. Codes, models, and AutoPET-RG-Lym will be released.

- **Summary**: Learned image compression (LIC) has recently benefited from Transformer based and state space model (SSM) based architectures. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local high frequency details, whereas Transformers and SSMs provide strong long range modeling capabilities but may cause structural information loss or ignore frequency characteristics that are crucial for compression. In this work we propose HCFSSNet, a Hybrid Convolution and Frequency State Space Network for LIC. HCFSSNet uses CNNs to extract local high frequency structures and introduces a Vision Frequency State Space (VFSS) block that models long range low frequency information. The VFSS block combines an Omni directional Neighborhood State Space (VONSS) module, which scans features horizontally, vertically and diagonally, with an Adaptive Frequency Modulation Module (AFMM) that applies content adaptive weighting of discrete cosine transform frequency components for more efficient bit allocation. To further reduce redundancy in the entropy model, we integrate AFMM with a Swin Transformer to form a Frequency Swin Transformer Attention Module (FSTAM) for frequency aware side information modeling. Experiments on the Kodak, Tecnick and CLIC Professional Validation datasets show that HCFSSNet achieves competitive rate distortion performance compared with recent SSM based codecs such as MambaIC, while using significantly fewer parameters. On Kodak, Tecnick and CLIC, HCFSSNet reduces BD rate over the VTM anchor by 18.06, 24.56 and 22.44 percent, respectively, providing an efficient and interpretable hybrid architecture for future learned image compression systems.

- **Summary**: Flow matching has emerged as a promising generative approach that addresses the lengthy sampling times associated with state-of-the-art diffusion models and enables a more flexible trajectory design, while maintaining high-quality image generation. This capability makes it suitable as a generative prior for image restoration tasks. Although current methods leveraging flow models have shown promising results in restoration, some still suffer from long processing times or produce over-smoothed results. To address these challenges, we introduce Restora-Flow, a training-free method that guides flow matching sampling by a degradation mask and incorporates a trajectory correction mechanism to enforce consistency with degraded inputs. We evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets across several image restoration tasks involving a mask-based degradation, i.e., inpainting, super-resolution and denoising. We show superior perceptual quality and processing time compared to diffusion and flow matching-based reference methods.

- **Summary**: The uncertainty of clinical examinations frequently leads to irregular observation intervals in longitudinal imaging data, posing challenges for modeling disease progression.Most existing imaging-based disease prediction models operate in Euclidean space, which assumes a flat representation of data and fails to fully capture the intrinsic continuity and nonlinear geometric structure of irregularly sampled longitudinal images. To address the challenge of modeling Alzheimers disease (AD) progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) data, we propose a Riemannian manifold mapping, a Time-aware manifold Neural ordinary differential equation, and an Attention-based riemannian Gated recurrent unit (R-TNAG) framework. Our approach first projects features extracted from high-dimensional sMRI into a manifold space to preserve the intrinsic geometry of disease progression. On this representation, a time-aware Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TNODE) models the continuous evolution of latent states between observations, while an Attention-based Riemannian Gated Recurrent Unit (ARGRU) adaptively integrates historical and current information to handle irregular intervals. This joint design improves temporal consistency and yields robust AD trajectory prediction under irregular sampling.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both disease status prediction and cognitive score regression. Ablation studies verify the contributions of each module, highlighting their complementary roles in enhancing predictive accuracy. Moreover, the model exhibits stable performance across varying sequence lengths and missing data rates, indicating strong temporal generalizability. Cross-dataset validation further confirms its robustness and applicability in diverse clinical settings.

- **Summary**: Motion planning for autonomous driving must handle multiple plausible futures while remaining computationally efficient. Recent end-to-end systems and world-model-based planners predict rich multi-modal trajectories, but typically rely on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning to select a single best mode for training and control. This selection discards information about alternative futures and complicates optimization. We propose MAP-World, a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that couples masked action planning with a path-weighted world model. The Masked Action Planning (MAP) module treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion: past waypoints are encoded as visible tokens, future waypoints are represented as mask tokens, and a driving-intent path provides a coarse scaffold. A compact latent planning state is expanded into multiple trajectory queries with injected noise, yielding diverse, temporally consistent modes without anchor libraries or teacher policies. A lightweight world model then rolls out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory. During training, semantic losses are computed as an expectation over modes, using trajectory probabilities as discrete path weights, so the planner learns from the full distribution of plausible futures instead of a single selected path. On NAVSIM, our method matches anchor-based approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance among world-model-based methods, while avoiding reinforcement learning and maintaining real-time inference latency.

- **Summary**: Parametric 3D human models such as SMPL have driven significant advances in human pose and shape estimation, yet their simplified kinematics limit biomechanical realism. The recently proposed SKEL model addresses this limitation by re-rigging SMPL with an anatomically accurate skeleton. However, estimating SKEL parameters directly remains challenging due to limited training data, perspective ambiguities, and the inherent complexity of human articulation. We introduce SKEL-CF, a coarse-to-fine framework for SKEL parameter estimation. SKEL-CF employs a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder predicts coarse camera and SKEL parameters, and the decoder progressively refines them in successive layers. To ensure anatomically consistent supervision, we convert the existing SMPL-based dataset 4DHuman into a SKEL-aligned version, 4DHuman-SKEL, providing high-quality training data for SKEL estimation. In addition, to mitigate depth and scale ambiguities, we explicitly incorporate camera modeling into the SKEL-CF pipeline and demonstrate its importance across diverse viewpoints. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed design. On the challenging MOYO dataset, SKEL-CF achieves 85.0 MPJPE / 51.4 PA-MPJPE, significantly outperforming the previous SKEL-based state-of-the-art HSMR (104.5 / 79.6). These results establish SKEL-CF as a scalable and anatomically faithful framework for human motion analysis, bridging the gap between computer vision and biomechanics. Our implementation is available on the project page: https://pokerman8.github.io/SKEL-CF/.

- **Summary**: While continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) has shown promise in adapting multimodal large language models (MLLMs), existing studies predominantly focus on models without safety alignment. This critical oversight ignores the fact that real-world MLLMs inherently require such mechanisms to mitigate potential risks. In this work, we shift our focus to CVIT for safety-aligned MLLMs and observe that during continual adaptation, the model not only suffers from task forgetting but also exhibits degradation in its safety. Achieving a harmonious balance between safety and task performance remains a crucial challenge. To address this, we propose Harmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA), a post-training framework composed of focusing-based parameter partition, harmoniously balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter adjustment. Specifically, HPA partitions parameters into two types based on their focus on safety or task performance, and selects the focused ones to preserve from a balanced perspective. In addition, HPA imposes orthogonality constraints on parameter updates to further alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on the CVIT benchmark and safety evaluation datasets demonstrate that HPA better maintains high safety and mitigates forgetting than existing baselines.

- **Summary**: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) show increasing performance in realistic visual tasks for images and, more recently, for videos. For example, given a video sequence, such models are able to describe in detail objects, the surroundings and dynamic actions. In this study, we explored the extent to which these models ground their semantic understanding in the actual visual input. Specifically, given sequences of hands interacting with objects, we asked models when and where the interaction begins or ends. For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene. Our findings suggest that in struggling to pinpoint the moment and location of physical contact that defines the interaction, the models lack the perceptual grounding required for deeper understanding of dynamic scenes.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify defects using normal-only training data. Existing anomaly detection benchmarks (e.g., MVTec-AD with 15 categories) cover only a narrow range of categories, limiting the evaluation of cross-context generalization and scalability. We introduce ADNet, a large-scale, multi-domain benchmark comprising 380 categories aggregated from 49 publicly available datasets across Electronics, Industry, Agrifood, Infrastructure, and Medical domains. The benchmark includes a total of 196,294 RGB images, consisting of 116,192 normal samples for training and 80,102 test images, of which 60,311 are anomalous. All images are standardized with MVTec-style pixel-level annotations and structured text descriptions spanning both spatial and visual attributes, enabling multimodal anomaly detection tasks. Extensive experiments reveal a clear scalability challenge: existing state-of-the-art methods achieve 90.6% I-AUROC in one-for-one settings but drop to 78.5% when scaling to all 380 categories in a multi-class setting. To address this, we propose Dinomaly-m, a context-guided Mixture-of-Experts extension of Dinomaly that expands decoder capacity without increasing inference cost. It achieves 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches. ADNet is designed as a standardized and extensible benchmark, supporting the community in expanding anomaly detection datasets across diverse domains and providing a scalable foundation for future anomaly detection foundation models.

- **Summary**: Eye tracking is fundamental to numerous applications, yet achieving robust, high-frequency tracking with ultra-low power consumption remains challenging for wearable platforms. While event-based vision sensors offer microsecond resolution and sparse data streams, they have lacked fully integrated, low-power processing solutions capable of real-time inference. In this work, we present the first battery-powered, wearable pupil-center-tracking system with complete on-device integration, combining event-based sensing and neuromorphic processing on the commercially available Speck2f system-on-chip with lightweight coordinate decoding on a low-power microcontroller. Our solution features a novel uncertainty-quantifying spiking neural network with gated temporal decoding, optimized for strict memory and bandwidth constraints, complemented by systematic deployment mechanisms that bridge the reality gap. We validate our system on a new multi-user dataset and demonstrate a wearable prototype with dual neuromorphic devices achieving robust binocular pupil tracking at 100 Hz with an average power consumption below 5 mW per eye. Our work demonstrates that end-to-end neuromorphic computing enables practical, always-on eye tracking for next-generation energy-efficient wearable systems.

- **Summary**: Foundation video generation models such as WAN 2.2 exhibit strong text- and image-conditioned synthesis abilities but remain constrained to the same-view generation setting. In this work, we introduce Exo2EgoSyn, an adaptation of WAN 2.2 that unlocks Exocentric-to-Egocentric(Exo2Ego) cross-view video synthesis. Our framework consists of three key modules. Ego-Exo View Alignment(EgoExo-Align) enforces latent-space alignment between exocentric and egocentric first-frame representations, reorienting the generative space from the given exo view toward the ego view. Multi-view Exocentric Video Conditioning (MultiExoCon) aggregates multi-view exocentric videos into a unified conditioning signal, extending WAN2.2 beyond its vanilla single-image or text conditioning. Furthermore, Pose-Aware Latent Injection (PoseInj) injects relative exo-to-ego camera pose information into the latent state, guiding geometry-aware synthesis across viewpoints. Together, these modules enable high-fidelity ego view video generation from third-person observations without retraining from scratch. Experiments on ExoEgo4D validate that Exo2EgoSyn significantly improves Ego2Exo synthesis, paving the way for scalable cross-view video generation with foundation models. Source code and models will be released publicly.

- **Summary**: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) task aims to answer questions about videos by leveraging the visual text appearing within the videos. This task poses significant challenges, requiring models to accurately perceive and comprehend scene text that varies in scale, orientation, and clarity across frames, while effectively integrating temporal and semantic context to generate precise answers. Moreover, the model must identify question-relevant textual cues and filter out redundant or irrelevant information to ensure answering is guided by the most relevant and informative cues. To address these challenges, we propose SFA, a training-free framework and the first Video-LLM-based method tailored for Video TextVQA, motivated by the human process of answering questions. By adaptively scanning video frames, selectively focusing on key regions, and directly amplifying them, SFA effectively guides the Video-LLM's attention toward essential cues, enabling it to generate more accurate answers. SFA achieves new state-of-the-art results across several public Video TextVQA datasets and surpasses previous methods by a substantial margin, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.

- **Summary**: We propose GHR-VQA, Graph-guided Hierarchical Relational Reasoning for Video Question Answering (Video QA), a novel human-centric framework that incorporates scene graphs to capture intricate human-object interactions within video sequences. Unlike traditional pixel-based methods, each frame is represented as a scene graph and human nodes across frames are linked to a global root, forming the video-level graph and enabling cross-frame reasoning centered on human actors. The video-level graphs are then processed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), transforming them into rich, context-aware embeddings for efficient processing. Finally, these embeddings are integrated with question features in a hierarchical network operating across different abstraction levels, enhancing both local and global understanding of video content. This explicit human-rooted structure enhances interpretability by decomposing actions into human-object interactions and enables a more profound understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics. We validate our approach on the Action Genome Question Answering (AGQA) dataset, achieving significant performance improvements, including a 7.3% improvement in object-relation reasoning over the state of the art.

- **Summary**: Generative models have excelled in RGB synthesis, but real-world applications require RGBA manipulation. This has led to a fragmented landscape: specialized, single-task models handle alpha but lack versatility, while unified multi-task frameworks are confined to the RGB domain. To bridge this critical gap, we propose OmniAlpha, the first unified, multi-task generative framework for sequence-to-sequence RGBA image generation and editing. Its architecture features MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method with a bi-directionally extendable layer axis for its Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple input and target RGBA layers. To power this framework, we introduce AlphaLayers, a new dataset of 1,000 high-quality, multi-layer triplets, built via a novel automated synthesis and filter pipeline. Jointly training OmniAlpha on this dataset across a comprehensive suite of 21 diverse tasks, extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified approach consistently outperforms strong, specialized baselines. Most notably, OmniAlpha achieves a dramatic 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% of human preferences in layer-conditioned completion. Our work proves that a unified, multi-task model can learn a superior shared representation for RGBA, paving the way for more powerful, layer-aware generative systems.

- **Summary**: Existing navigation benchmarks focus on task success metrics while overlooking economic viability -- critical for commercial deployment of autonomous delivery robots. We introduce \emph{CostNav}, a \textbf{Micro-Navigation Economic Testbed} that evaluates embodied agents through comprehensive cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters. \textbf{To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability}, revealing that optimizing for task success fundamentally differs from optimizing for economic deployment. Our cost model uses parameters derived from industry data sources (energy rates, delivery service pricing), and we project from a reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries. Under this projection, the baseline achieves 43.0\% SLA compliance but is \emph{not} commercially viable: yielding a loss of \$30.009 per run with no finite break-even point, because operating costs are dominated by collision-induced maintenance, which accounts for 99.7\% of per-run costs and highlights collision avoidance as a key optimization target. We demonstrate a learning-based on-device navigation baseline and establish a foundation for evaluating rule-based navigation, imitation learning, and cost-aware RL training. CostNav bridges the gap between navigation research and commercial deployment, enabling data-driven decisions about economic trade-offs across navigation paradigms.

- **Summary**: Camouflage Images Generation (CIG) is an emerging research area that focuses on synthesizing images in which objects are harmoniously blended and exhibit high visual consistency with their surroundings. Existing methods perform CIG by either fusing objects into specific backgrounds or outpainting the surroundings via foreground object-guided diffusion. However, they often fail to obtain natural results because they overlook the logical relationship between camouflaged objects and background environments. To address this issue, we propose CT-CIG, a Controllable Text-guided Camouflage Images Generation method that produces realistic and logically plausible camouflage images. Leveraging Large Visual Language Models (VLM), we design a Camouflage-Revealing Dialogue Mechanism (CRDM) to annotate existing camouflage datasets with high-quality text prompts. Subsequently, the constructed image-prompt pairs are utilized to finetune Stable Diffusion, incorporating a lightweight controller to guide the location and shape of camouflaged objects for enhanced camouflage scene fitness. Moreover, we design a Frequency Interaction Refinement Module (FIRM) to capture high-frequency texture features, facilitating the learning of complex camouflage patterns. Extensive experiments, including CLIPScore evaluation and camouflage effectiveness assessment, demonstrate the semantic alignment of our generated text prompts and CT-CIG's ability to produce photorealistic camouflage images.

- **Summary**: The significant molecular and pathological heterogeneity of glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor, complicates diagnosis and patient stratification. While traditional histopathological assessment remains the standard, deep learning offers a promising path toward objective and automated analysis of whole slide images. For the BraTS-Path 2025 Challenge, we developed a method that fine-tunes a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a dedicated classification head on the official training dataset. Our model's performance on the online validation set, evaluated via the Synapse platform, yielded a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.7064 and an F1-score of 0.7676. On the final test set, the model achieved an MCC of 0.6509 and an F1-score of 0.5330, which secured our team second place in the BraTS-Pathology 2025 Challenge. Our results establish a solid baseline for ViT-based histopathological analysis, and future efforts will focus on bridging the performance gap observed on the unseen validation data.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks have evolved from simply disrupting predictions on conventional task-specific models to the more complex goal of manipulating image semantics on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept. By bypassing the entangled patch features, V-Attack achieves highly effective semantic control. Extensive experiments across diverse LVLMs, including LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL and GPT-4o, show that V-Attack improves the attack success rate by an average of 36% over state-of-the-art methods, exposing critical vulnerabilities in modern visual-language understanding.

- **Summary**: Existing deep learning methods in multimode fiber (MMF) imaging often focus on simpler datasets, limiting their applicability to complex, real-world imaging tasks. These models are typically data-intensive, a challenge that becomes more pronounced when dealing with diverse and complex images. In this work, we propose HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning architecture designed to reconstruct structurally rich medical images from MMF speckles. To build a clinically relevant dataset, we develop an optical setup that couples laser light through a spatial light modulator (SLM) into an MMF, capturing output speckle patterns corresponding to input OrganAMNIST images. Unlike previous MMF imaging approaches, which have not considered the underlying statistics of speckles and reconstructed images, we introduce a distribution-aware learning strategy. We employ a histogram-based mutual information loss to enhance model robustness and reduce reliance on large datasets. Our model includes a histogram computation unit that estimates smooth marginal and joint histograms for calculating mutual information loss. It also incorporates a unique Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module, which leads to multiscale Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss computation. Together, these two loss functions enhance both the structural fidelity and statistical alignment of the reconstructed images. Our experiments on the complex OrganAMNIST dataset demonstrate that HistoSpeckle-Net achieves higher fidelity than baseline models such as U-Net and Pix2Pix. It gives superior performance even with limited training samples and across varying fiber bending conditions. By effectively reconstructing complex anatomical features with reduced data and under fiber perturbations, HistoSpeckle-Net brings MMF imaging closer to practical deployment in real-world clinical environments.

- **Summary**: Medical AI systems face catastrophic forgetting when deployed in clinical settings, where models must learn new imaging protocols while retaining prior diagnostic capabilities. This challenge is particularly acute for medical vision-language models that must preserve complex cross-modal alignments between medical images and clinical terminology across diverse imaging modalities. We introduce Prompt- Aware Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation (PA-EWC), a novel continual learning approach that addresses catastrophic forgetting through prompt-guided parameter specialization. Our method systematically categorizes model parameters based on their functional roles in processing visual-descriptive, spatial-guided, and medical-semantic information, enabling targeted protection of critical knowledge while allowing adaptation to new clinical requirements. PA-EWC incorporates adaptive Fisher Information computation with gradient stability analysis and develops weighted complexity metrics based on medical terminology density. We evaluate our approach across five medical imaging datasets (Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2018, CheXlocalize, BUSI, CAMUS) representing diverse modalities including endoscopy, dermoscopy, radiography, and ultrasound. Experimental results demonstrate that PA-EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting by up to 17.58% compared to baseline methods, with performance improvements of 4.30% on chest X-ray pathology localization and 6.06% on polyp segmentation.

- **Summary**: Obtaining the precise 3D motion of a table tennis ball from standard monocular videos is a challenging problem, as existing methods trained on synthetic data struggle to generalize to the noisy, imperfect ball and table detections of the real world. This is primarily due to the inherent lack of 3D ground truth trajectories and spin annotations for real-world video. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates. By integrating a ball detector and a table keypoint detector, our approach transforms a proof-of-concept uplifting method into a practical, robust, and high-performing end-to-end application for 3D table tennis trajectory and spin analysis.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved remarkable visual outcomes through large-scale rectified flow models. However, how these models behave under long prompts remains underexplored. Long prompts encode rich content, spatial, and stylistic information that enhances fidelity but often suppresses diversity, leading to repetitive and less creative outputs. In this work, we systematically study this fidelity-diversity dilemma and reveal that state-of-the-art models exhibit a clear drop in diversity as prompt length increases. To enable consistent evaluation, we introduce LPD-Bench, a benchmark designed for assessing both fidelity and diversity in long-prompt generation. Building on our analysis, we develop a theoretical framework that increases sampling entropy through prompt reformulation and propose a training-free method, PromptMoG, which samples prompt embeddings from a Mixture-of-Gaussians in the embedding space to enhance diversity while preserving semantics. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art models, SD3.5-Large, Flux.1-Krea-Dev, CogView4, and Qwen-Image, demonstrate that PromptMoG consistently improves long-prompt generation diversity without semantic drifting.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection is fundamental for spatial understanding. Real-world environments demand models capable of recognizing diverse, previously unseen objects, which remains a major limitation of closed-set methods. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detectors relax annotation requirements but still depend on training scenes, either as point clouds or images. We take this a step further by introducing Zoo3D, the first training-free 3D object detection framework. Our method constructs 3D bounding boxes via graph clustering of 2D instance masks, then assigns semantic labels using a novel open-vocabulary module with best-view selection and view-consensus mask generation. Zoo3D operates in two modes: the zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$, which requires no training at all, and the self-supervised Zoo3D$_1$, which refines 3D box prediction by training a class-agnostic detector on Zoo3D$_0$-generated pseudo labels. Furthermore, we extend Zoo3D beyond point clouds to work directly with posed and even unposed images. Across ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks, both Zoo3D$_0$ and Zoo3D$_1$ achieve state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Remarkably, our zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$ outperforms all existing self-supervised methods, hence demonstrating the power and adaptability of training-free, off-the-shelf approaches for real-world 3D understanding.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery relies on endoscopic video as the sole intraoperative visual feedback. The DaVinci Xi system overlays a graphical user interface (UI) that indicates the state of each robotic arm, including the activation of the endoscope arm. Detecting this activation provides valuable metadata such as camera movement information, which can support downstream surgical data science tasks including tool tracking, skill assessment, or camera control automation.   Methods: We developed a lightweight pipeline based on a ResNet18 convolutional neural network to automatically identify the position of the camera tile and its activation state within the DaVinci Xi UI. The model was fine-tuned on manually annotated data from the SurgToolLoc dataset and evaluated across three public datasets comprising over 70,000 frames.   Results: The model achieved F1-scores between 0.993 and 1.000 for the binary detection of active cameras and correctly localized the camera tile in all cases without false multiple-camera detections.   Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables reliable, real-time extraction of camera activation metadata from surgical videos, facilitating automated preprocessing and analysis for diverse downstream applications. All code, trained models, and annotations are publicly available.

- **Summary**: A reliable reward function is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) in image generation. Most current RL approaches depend on pre-trained preference models that output scalar rewards to approximate human preferences. However, these rewards often fail to capture human perception and are vulnerable to reward hacking, where higher scores do not correspond to better images. To address this, we introduce Adv-GRPO, an RL framework with an adversarial reward that iteratively updates both the reward model and the generator. The reward model is supervised using reference images as positive samples and can largely avoid being hacked. Unlike KL regularization that constrains parameter updates, our learned reward directly guides the generator through its visual outputs, leading to higher-quality images. Moreover, while optimizing existing reward functions can alleviate reward hacking, their inherent biases remain. For instance, PickScore may degrade image quality, whereas OCR-based rewards often reduce aesthetic fidelity. To address this, we take the image itself as a reward, using reference images and vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) to provide rich visual rewards. These dense visual signals, instead of a single scalar, lead to consistent gains across image quality, aesthetics, and task-specific metrics. Finally, we show that combining reference samples with foundation-model rewards enables distribution transfer and flexible style customization. In human evaluation, our method outperforms Flow-GRPO and SD3, achieving 70.0% and 72.4% win rates in image quality and aesthetics, respectively. Code and models have been released.

- **Summary**: Weight Averaging (WA) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing generalization by promoting convergence to a flat loss landscape, which correlates with stronger out-of-distribution performance. However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts. MBCD begins with adaptive modality dropout in the student model to curb early-stage bias toward dominant modalities. A gradient consistency constraint then aligns learning signals between uni-modal branches and the fused representation, encouraging coordinated and smoother optimization. Finally, a WA-based teacher conducts cross-modal distillation by transferring fused knowledge to each uni-modal branch, which strengthens cross-modal interactions and steer convergence toward flatter solutions. Extensive experiments on MMDG benchmarks show that MBCD consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse unseen domains.

- **Summary**: Image classification is a well-studied task in computer vision, and yet it remains challenging under high-uncertainty conditions, such as when input images are corrupted or training data are limited. Conventional classification approaches typically train models to directly predict class labels from input images, but this might lead to suboptimal performance in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM), a novel framework that leverages a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on the input image. DiDiCM supports diffusion-based predictions either on class probabilities or on discrete class labels, providing flexibility in computation and memory trade-offs. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the superior performance of DiDiCM over standard classifiers, showing that a few diffusion iterations achieve higher classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to baselines, with accuracy gains increasing as the task becomes more challenging. We release our code at https://github.com/omerb01/didicm .

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection in industrial visual inspection is challenging due to the scarcity of defective samples. Most existing methods rely on unsupervised reconstruction using only normal data, often resulting in overfitting and poor detection of subtle defects. We propose a semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a neural batch sampler, an autoencoder, and a predictor. The RL-based sampler adaptively selects informative patches by balancing exploration and exploitation through a composite reward. The autoencoder generates loss profiles highlighting abnormal regions, while the predictor performs segmentation in the loss-profile space. This interaction enables the system to effectively learn both normal and defective patterns with limited labeled data. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy and better localization of subtle anomalies than recent state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining low complexity, yielding an average improvement of 0.15 in F1_max and 0.06 in AUC, with a maximum gain of 0.37 in F1_max in the best case.

- **Summary**: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become adept at recognizing objects, they often lack the intuitive, human-like understanding of the world's underlying physical and social principles. This high-level vision-grounded semantics, which we term visual knowledge, forms a bridge between perception and reasoning, yet remains an underexplored area in current MLLMs. To systematically evaluate this capability, we present VKnowU, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 1,680 questions in 1,249 videos, covering 8 core types of visual knowledge spanning both world-centric (e.g., intuitive physics) and human-centric (e.g., subjective intentions). Evaluation of 23 SOTA MLLMs reveals that leading models still fall short of human performance, with particularly notable gaps in the world-centric. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new dataset, VKnowQA, and VideoKnow+, a baseline model that explicitly incorporates visual knowledge into MLLMs. VideoKnow+ follows a structured See-Think-Answer paradigm and adopts reinforcement learning with visual knowledge reward, achieving a +3.7% improvement on VKnowU and consistent gains on MVBench, Video-MME, and MMVU. Our work highlights visual knowledge as a missing cornerstone for developing more generalizable MLLMs that can not only see but also truly understand our physical and social worlds.

- **Summary**: Until recently, the general corpus of CLIP-type fundamental models has widely explored either the retrieval of short descriptions or the classification of objects in the scene as SINGLE-object image classification task. The same holds for retrieving the image embedding (image retrieval task) given a text prompt. However, real-world scene images exhibit rich compositional structure involving multiple objects and actions. The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods. ScenarioCLIP demonstrates robust zero-shot and finetune performance on various domain-specific tasks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/scenario-clip/ScenarioCLIP

- **Summary**: Domain adaptive point cloud completion (DA PCC) aims to narrow the geometric and semantic discrepancies between the labeled source and unlabeled target domains. Existing methods either suffer from limited receptive fields or quadratic complexity due to using CNNs or vision Transformers. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the adaptability of State Space Models (SSMs) in DA PCC and find that directly applying SSMs to DA PCC will encounter several challenges: directly serializing 3D point clouds into 1D sequences often disrupts the spatial topology and local geometric features of the target domain. Besides, the overlook of designs in the learning domain-agnostic representations hinders the adaptation performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, DAPointMamba for DA PCC, that exhibits strong adaptability across domains and has the advantages of global receptive fields and efficient linear complexity. It has three novel modules. In particular, Cross-Domain Patch-Level Scanning introduces patch-level geometric correspondences, enabling effective local alignment. Cross-Domain Spatial SSM Alignment further strengthens spatial consistency by modulating patch features based on cross-domain similarity, effectively mitigating fine-grained structural discrepancies. Cross-Domain Channel SSM Alignment actively addresses global semantic gaps by interleaving and aligning feature channels. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DAPointMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with less computational complexity and inference latency.

- **Summary**: Despite progress toward end-to-end tracking with transformer architectures, poor detection performance and the conflict between detection and association in a joint architecture remain critical concerns. Recent approaches aim to mitigate these issues by (i) employing advanced denoising or label assignment strategies, or (ii) incorporating detection priors from external object detectors via distillation or anchor proposal techniques. Inspired by the success of integrating detection priors and by the key insight that MOTR-like models are secretly strong detection models, we introduce SelfMOTR, a novel tracking transformer that relies on self-generated detection priors. Through extensive analysis and ablation studies, we uncover and demonstrate the hidden detection capabilities of MOTR-like models, and present a practical set of tools for leveraging them effectively. On DanceTrack, SelfMOTR achieves strong performance, competing with recent state-of-the-art end-to-end tracking methods.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in video generation has led to impressive visual quality, yet current models still struggle to produce results that align with real-world physical principles. To this end, we propose an iterative self-refinement framework that leverages large language models and vision-language models to provide physics-aware guidance for video generation. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal chain-of-thought (MM-CoT) process that refines prompts based on feedback from physical inconsistencies, progressively enhancing generation quality. This method is training-free and plug-and-play, making it readily applicable to a wide range of video generation models. Experiments on the PhyIQ benchmark show that our method improves the Physics-IQ score from 56.31 to 62.38. We hope this work serves as a preliminary exploration of physics-consistent video generation and may offer insights for future research.

- **Summary**: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) are minimal and semantically meaningful modifications of the input of a model that alter the model predictions. They highlight the decisive features the model relies on, providing contrastive interpretations for classifiers. State-of-the-art visual counterfactual explanation methods are designed to explain image classifiers. The generation of CFEs for video classifiers remains largely underexplored. For the counterfactual videos to be useful, they have to be physically plausible, temporally coherent, and exhibit smooth motion trajectories. Existing CFE image-based methods, designed to explain image classifiers, lack the capacity to generate temporally coherent, smooth and physically plausible video CFEs. To address this, we propose Back To The Feature (BTTF), an optimization framework that generates video CFEs. Our method introduces two novel features, 1) an optimization scheme to retrieve the initial latent noise conditioned by the first frame of the input video, 2) a two-stage optimization strategy to enable the search for counterfactual videos in the vicinity of the input video. Both optimization processes are guided solely by the target classifier, ensuring the explanation is faithful. To accelerate convergence, we also introduce a progressive optimization strategy that incrementally increases the number of denoising steps. Extensive experiments on video datasets such as Shape-Moving (motion classification), MEAD (emotion classification), and NTU RGB+D (action classification) show that our BTTF effectively generates valid, visually similar and realistic counterfactual videos that provide concrete insights into the classifier's decision-making mechanism.

- **Summary**: Despite significant advancements in deep learning-based sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction algorithms, these methods still encounter two primary limitations: (i) It is challenging to explicitly prove that the prior networks of deep unfolding algorithms satisfy Lipschitz constraints due to their empirically designed nature. (ii) The substantial storage costs of training a separate model for each setting in the case of multiple views hinder practical clinical applications. To address these issues, we elaborate an explicitly provable Lipschitz-constrained network, dubbed LipNet, and integrate an explicit prompt module to provide discriminative knowledge of different sparse sampling settings, enabling the treatment of multiple sparse view configurations within a single model. Furthermore, we develop a storage-saving deep unfolding framework for multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, termed PromptCT, which embeds LipNet as its prior network to ensure the convergence of its corresponding iterative algorithm. In simulated and real data experiments, PromptCT outperforms benchmark reconstruction algorithms in multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, achieving higher-quality reconstructions with lower storage costs. On the theoretical side, we explicitly demonstrate that LipNet satisfies boundary property, further proving its Lipschitz continuity and subsequently analyzing the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms. The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/shibaoshun/PromptCT.

- **Summary**: In Remote Sensing (RS), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key approach to activate the generalizable representation ability of foundation models for downstream tasks. However, existing specialized PEFT methods often fail when applied to large-scale Earth observation tasks, as they are unable to fully handle the multifaceted and unpredictable domain gaps (\eg, spatial, semantic, and frequency shifts) inherent in RS data. To overcome this, we propose CrossEarth-Gate, which introduces two primary contributions. First, we establish a comprehensive RS module toolbox to address multifaceted domain gaps, comprising spatial, semantic, and frequency modules. Second, we develop a Fisher-guided adaptive selection mechanism that operates on this toolbox. This selection is guided by Fisher Information to quantify each module's importance by measuring its contribution to the task-specific gradient flow. It dynamically activates only the most critical modules at the appropriate layers, guiding the gradient flow to maximize adaptation effectiveness and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments validate the efficacy and generalizability of our method, where CrossEarth-Gate achieves state-of-the-art performance across 16 cross-domain benchmarks for RS semantic segmentation. The code of the work will be released.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes across bi-temporal satellite images. Most previous methods rely solely on mask supervision, which effectively guides spatial localization but provides limited constraints on the temporal semantic transitions. Consequently, they often produce spatially coherent predictions while still suffering from unresolved semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose TaCo, a spatio-temporal semantic consistent network, which enriches the existing mask-supervised framework with a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint. TaCo conceptualizes change as a semantic transition between bi-temporal states, in which one temporal feature representation can be derived from the other via dedicated transition features. To realize this, we introduce a Text-guided Transition Generator that integrates textual semantics with bi-temporal visual features to construct the cross-temporal transition features. In addition, we propose a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint consisting of bi-temporal reconstruct constraints and a transition constraint: the former enforces alignment between reconstructed and original features, while the latter enhances discrimination for changes. This design can yield substantial performance gains without introducing any additional computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments on six public datasets, spanning both binary and semantic change detection tasks, demonstrate that TaCo consistently achieves SOTA performance.

- **Summary**: Rectified Flow (RF) models have advanced high-quality image and video synthesis via optimal transport theory. However, when applied to image-to-image translation, they still depend on costly multi-step denoising, hindering real-time applications. Although the recent adversarial training paradigm, CycleGAN-Turbo, works in pretrained diffusion models for one-step image translation, we find that directly applying it to RF models leads to severe convergence issues. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and propose TReFT, a novel method to Tame Rectified Flow models for one-step image Translation. Unlike previous works, TReFT directly uses the velocity predicted by pretrained DiT or UNet as output-a simple yet effective design that tackles the convergence issues under adversarial training with one-step inference. This design is mainly motivated by a novel observation that, near the end of the denoising process, the velocity predicted by pretrained RF models converges to the vector from origin to the final clean image, a property we further justify through theoretical analysis. When applying TReFT to large pretrained RF models such as SD3.5 and FLUX, we introduce memory-efficient latent cycle-consistency and identity losses during training, as well as lightweight architectural simplifications for faster inference. Pretrained RF models finetuned with TReFT achieve performance comparable to sota methods across multiple image translation datasets while enabling real-time inference.

- **Summary**: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to low signal-to-noise ratios, complex backgrounds, and the absence of discernible target features. While deep learning-based encoder-decoder frameworks have advanced the field, their static pattern learning suffers from pattern drift across diverse scenarios (\emph{e.g.}, day/night variations, sky/maritime/ground domains), limiting robustness. To address this, we propose IrisNet, a novel meta-learned framework that dynamically adapts detection strategies to the input infrared image status. Our approach establishes a dynamic mapping between infrared image features and entire decoder parameters via an image-to-decoder transformer. More concretely, we represent the parameterized decoder as a structured 2D tensor preserving hierarchical layer correlations and enable the transformer to model inter-layer dependencies through self-attention while generating adaptive decoding patterns via cross-attention. To further enhance the perception ability of infrared images, we integrate high-frequency components to supplement target-position and scene-edge information. Experiments on NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K datasets demonstrate the superiority of our IrisNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: End-to-end models for autonomous driving hold the promise of learning complex behaviors directly from sensor data, but face critical challenges in safety and handling long-tail events. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising path to overcome these limitations, yet its success in autonomous driving has been elusive. We identify a fundamental flaw hindering this progress: a deep seated optimistic bias in the world models used for RL. To address this, we introduce a framework for post-training policy refinement built around an Impartial World Model. Our primary contribution is to teach this model to be honest about danger. We achieve this with a novel data synthesis pipeline, Counterfactual Synthesis, which systematically generates a rich curriculum of plausible collisions and off-road events. This transforms the model from a passive scene completer into a veridical forecaster that remains faithful to the causal link between actions and outcomes. We then integrate this Impartial World Model into our closed-loop RL framework, where it serves as an internal critic. During refinement, the agent queries the critic to ``dream" of the outcomes for candidate actions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, including on a new Risk Foreseeing Benchmark, that our model significantly outperforms baselines in predicting failures. Consequently, when used as a critic, it enables a substantial reduction in safety violations in challenging simulations, proving that teaching a model to dream of danger is a critical step towards building truly safe and intelligent autonomous agents.

- **Summary**: Interactive articulated manipulation requires long-horizon, multi-step interactions with appliances while maintaining physical consistency. Existing vision-language and diffusion-based policies struggle to generalize across parts, instances, and categories. We first introduce ArtiBench, a five-level benchmark covering kitchen, storage, office, and tool environments. ArtiBench enables structured evaluation from cross-part and cross-instance variation to long-horizon multi-object tasks, revealing the core generalization challenges of articulated object manipulation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ArtiBrain, a modular framework that unifies high-level reasoning with adaptive low-level control. ArtiBrain uses a VLM-based Task Reasoner (GPT-4.1) to decompose and validate subgoals, and employs a Hybrid Controller that combines geometry-aware keyframe execution with affordance-guided diffusion for precise and interpretable manipulation. An Affordance Memory Bank continually accumulates successful execution episodes and propagates part-level actionable affordances to unseen articulated parts and configurations. Extensive experiments on ArtiBench show that our ArtiBrain significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and diffusion-based methods in robustness and generalization. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Estimating homography from a single image remains a challenging yet practically valuable task, particularly in domains like retail, where only one viewpoint is typically available for shelf monitoring and product alignment. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework that predicts a 4-point parameterized homography matrix to rectify shelf images captured from arbitrary angles. Our model leverages a ConvNeXt-based backbone for enhanced feature representation and adopts normalized coordinate regression for improved stability. To address data scarcity and promote generalization, we introduce a novel augmentation strategy by modeling and sampling synthetic homographies. Our method achieves a mean corner error of 1.298 pixels on the test set. When compared with both classical computer vision and deep learning-based approaches, our method demonstrates competitive performance in both accuracy and inference speed. Together, these results establish our approach as a robust and efficient solution for realworld single-view rectification. To encourage further research in this domain, we will make our dataset, ShelfRectSet, and code publicly available

- **Summary**: We present AMB3R, a multi-view feed-forward model for dense 3D reconstruction on a metric-scale that addresses diverse 3D vision tasks. The key idea is to leverage a sparse, yet compact, volumetric scene representation as our backend, enabling geometric reasoning with spatial compactness. Although trained solely for multi-view reconstruction, we demonstrate that AMB3R can be seamlessly extended to uncalibrated visual odometry (online) or large-scale structure from motion without the need for task-specific fine-tuning or test-time optimization. Compared to prior pointmap-based models, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera pose, depth, and metric-scale estimation, 3D reconstruction, and even surpasses optimization-based SLAM and SfM methods with dense reconstruction priors on common benchmarks.

- **Summary**: 3D reconstruction for Digital Twins often relies on LiDAR-based methods, which provide accurate geometry but lack the semantics and textures naturally captured by cameras. Traditional LiDAR-camera fusion approaches require complex calibration and still struggle with certain materials like glass, which are visible in images but poorly represented in point clouds. We propose a camera-only pipeline that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extracts semantic material masks via vision models, converts Gaussian representations to mesh surfaces with projected material labels, and assigns physics-based material properties for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines and simulators. This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements. We validate our camera-only method using an internal dataset from an instrumented test vehicle, leveraging LiDAR as ground truth for reflectivity validation alongside image similarity metrics.

- **Summary**: Humans rely on the synergistic control of head (cephalomotor) and eye (oculomotor) to efficiently search for visual information in 360°. However, prior approaches to visual search are limited to a static image, neglecting the physical embodiment and its interaction with the 3D world. How can we develop embodied visual search agents as efficient as humans while bypassing the constraints imposed by real-world hardware? To this end, we propose humanoid visual search where a humanoid agent actively rotates its head to search for objects or paths in an immersive world represented by a 360° panoramic image. To study visual search in visually-crowded real-world scenarios, we build H* Bench, a new benchmark that moves beyond household scenes to challenging in-the-wild scenes that necessitate advanced visual-spatial reasoning capabilities, such as transportation hubs, large-scale retail spaces, urban streets, and public institutions. Our experiments first reveal that even top-tier proprietary models falter, achieving only ~30% success in object and path search. We then use post-training techniques to enhance the open-source Qwen2.5-VL, increasing its success rate by over threefold for both object search (14.83% to 47.38%) and path search (6.44% to 24.94%). Notably, the lower ceiling of path search reveals its inherent difficulty, which we attribute to the demand for sophisticated spatial commonsense. Our results not only show a promising path forward but also quantify the immense challenge that remains in building MLLM agents that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday human life.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in editing technologies for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made it simple to manipulate 3D scenes. However, these technologies raise concerns about potential malicious manipulation of 3D content. To avoid such malicious applications, localizing tampered regions becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose GS-Checker, a novel method for locating tampered areas in 3DGS models. Our approach integrates a 3D tampering attribute into the 3D Gaussian parameters to indicate whether the Gaussian has been tampered. Additionally, we design a 3D contrastive mechanism by comparing the similarity of key attributes between 3D Gaussians to seek tampering cues at 3D level. Furthermore, we introduce a cyclic optimization strategy to refine the 3D tampering attribute, enabling more accurate tampering localization. Notably, our approach does not require expensive 3D labels for supervision. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to locate the tampered 3DGS area.

- **Summary**: Image manipulation localization (IML) faces a fundamental trade-off between minimizing annotation cost and achieving fine-grained localization accuracy. Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that BoxPromptIML outperforms or rivals fully-supervised models, while maintaining strong generalization, low annotation cost, and efficient deployment characteristics.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing topologically consistent facial geometry is crucial for the digital avatar creation pipelines. Existing methods either require tedious manual efforts, lack generalization to in-the-wild data, or are constrained by the limited expressiveness of 3D Morphable Models. To address these limitations, we propose VGGTFace, an automatic approach that innovatively applies the 3D foundation model, i.e. VGGT, for topologically consistent facial geometry reconstruction from in-the-wild multi-view images captured by everyday users. Our key insight is that, by leveraging VGGT, our method naturally inherits strong generalization ability and expressive power from its large-scale training and point map representation. However, it is unclear how to reconstruct a topologically consistent mesh from VGGT, as the topology information is missing in its prediction. To this end, we augment VGGT with Pixel3DMM for injecting topology information via pixel-aligned UV values. In this manner, we convert the pixel-aligned point map of VGGT to a point cloud with topology. Tailored to this point cloud with known topology, we propose a novel Topology-Aware Bundle Adjustment strategy to fuse them, where we construct a Laplacian energy for the Bundle Adjustment objective. Our method achieves high-quality reconstruction in 10 seconds for 16 views on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and impressive generalization to in-the-wild data. Code is available at https://github.com/grignarder/vggtface.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art generation quality but require long sequential denoising trajectories, leading to high inference latency. Recent speculative inference methods enable lossless parallel sampling in U-Net-based diffusion models via a drafter-verifier scheme, but their acceleration is limited on DiTs due to insufficient draft accuracy during verification. To address this limitation, we analyze the DiTs' feature dynamics and find the features of the final transformer layer (top-block) exhibit strong temporal consistency and rich semantic abstraction. Based on this insight, we propose FREE, a novel framework that employs a lightweight drafter to perform feature-level autoregression with parallel verification, guaranteeing lossless acceleration with theoretical and empirical support. Meanwhile, prediction variance (uncertainty) of DiTs naturally increases in later denoising steps, reducing acceptance rates under speculative sampling. To mitigate this effect, we further introduce an uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy, forming FREE (relax), which dynamically adjusts the acceptance probability in response to uncertainty levels. Experiments on ImageNet-$512^2$ show that FREE achieves up to $1.86 \times$ acceleration, and FREE (relax) further reaches $2.25 \times$ speedup while maintaining high perceptual and quantitative fidelity in generation quality.

- **Summary**: Multi-ID customization is an interesting topic in computer vision and attracts considerable attention recently. Given the ID images of multiple individuals, its purpose is to generate a customized image that seamlessly integrates them while preserving their respective identities. Compared to single-ID customization, multi-ID customization is much more difficult and poses two major challenges. First, since the multi-ID customization model is trained to reconstruct an image from the cropped person regions, it often encounters the copy-paste issue during inference, leading to lower quality. Second, the model also suffers from inferior text controllability. The generated result simply combines multiple persons into one image, regardless of whether it is aligned with the input text. In this work, we propose MultiID to tackle this challenging task in a training-free manner. Since the existing single-ID customization models have less copy-paste issue, our key idea is to adapt these models to achieve multi-ID customization. To this end, we present an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism, injecting distinct ID embeddings into the corresponding image regions and thus generating multi-ID outputs. To enhance the generation controllability, we introduce three critical strategies, namely the local prompt, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention, making the results more consistent with the text prompts and ID images. We also carefully build a benchmark, called IDBench, for evaluation. The extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiID in solving the aforementioned two challenges. Its performance is comparable or even better than the training-based multi-ID customization methods.

- **Summary**: Timestep distillation is an effective approach for improving the generation efficiency of diffusion models. The Consistency Model (CM), as a trajectory-based framework, demonstrates significant potential due to its strong theoretical foundation and high-quality few-step generation. Nevertheless, current continuous-time consistency distillation methods still rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting their scalability to diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), which eliminates the dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory. Unlike conventional methods that require VAE encoding and large-scale datasets, our self-contained distillation paradigm significantly improves both efficiency and simplicity. Moreover, the trajectory-extracted samples naturally bridge the distribution gap between training and inference, thereby enabling more effective knowledge transfer. Empirically, TBCM achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k under one-step generation, while reducing training time by approximately 40% compared to Sana-Sprint and saving a substantial amount of GPU memory, demonstrating superior efficiency without sacrificing quality. We further reveal the diffusion-generation space discrepancy in continuous-time consistency distillation and analyze how sampling strategies affect distillation performance, offering insights for future distillation research.

- **Summary**: Generating realistic 3D cities is fundamental to world models, virtual reality, and game development, where an ideal urban scene must satisfy both stylistic diversity, fine-grained, and controllability. However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation. We expect our framework can inspire new avenues of research in 3D city generation. Our dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/MajutsuCity.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, where it is important to correctly detect objects and associate these detections across frames. Current approaches mainly focus on tracking objects in each frame of a video stream, making it almost impossible to run the model under conditions of limited computing resources. To address this issue, we propose StableTrack, a novel approach that stabilizes the quality of tracking on low-frequency detections. Our method introduces a new two-stage matching strategy to improve the cross-frame association between low-frequency detections. We propose a novel Bbox-Based Distance instead of the conventional Mahalanobis distance, which allows us to effectively match objects using the Re-ID model. Furthermore, we integrate visual tracking into the Kalman Filter and the overall tracking pipeline. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers in the case of low-frequency detections, achieving $\textit{11.6%}$ HOTA improvement at $\textit{1}$ Hz on MOT17-val, while keeping up with the best approaches on the standard MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks with full-frequency detections.

- **Summary**: Understanding the physical world requires perceptual models grounded in physical laws rather than mere statistical correlations. However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.

- **Summary**: Block-causal video generation faces a stark speed-quality trade-off: small 1.3B models manage only 16 FPS while large 14B models crawl at 4.5 FPS, forcing users to choose between responsiveness and quality. Block Cascading significantly mitigates this trade-off through training-free parallelization. Our key insight: future video blocks do not need fully denoised current blocks to begin generation. By starting block generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, we transform sequential pipelines into parallel cascades where multiple blocks denoise simultaneously. With 5 GPUs exploiting temporal parallelism, we achieve ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerate from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. Beyond inference speed, Block Cascading eliminates overhead from KV-recaching (of ~200ms) during context switches for interactive generation. Extensive evaluations validated against multiple block-causal pipelines demonstrate no significant loss in generation quality when switching from block-causal to Block Cascading pipelines for inference.

- **Summary**: Hirschsprung Disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. Therefore, their correct identification is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage segmentation framework based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework sequentially segments the muscularis propria, delineates the myenteric plexus, and identifies ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing expert manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells at varying levels of certainty. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For high-certainty ganglion cells, the model achieved 62.1% precision and 89.1% recall, while joint certainty scores yielded 67.0% precision. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.

- **Summary**: We propose BRIC, a novel test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that enables long-term human motion generation by resolving execution discrepancies between diffusion-based kinematic motion planners and reinforcement learning-based physics controllers. While diffusion models can generate diverse and expressive motions conditioned on text and scene context, they often produce physically implausible outputs, leading to execution drift during simulation. To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller to noisy motion plans at test time, while preserving pre-trained skills via a loss function that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. In addition, BRIC introduces a lightweight test-time guidance mechanism that steers the diffusion model in the signal space without updating its parameters. By combining both adaptation strategies, BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term executions across diverse environments in an effective and efficient manner. We validate the effectiveness of BRIC on a variety of long-term tasks, including motion composition, obstacle avoidance, and human-scene interaction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.

- **Summary**: In Vision Language Models (VLMs), vision tokens are quantity-heavy yet information-dispersed compared with language tokens, thus consume too much unnecessary computation. Pruning redundant vision tokens for high VLM inference efficiency has been continuously studied but all existing methods resort to indirect and non-guaranteed ways. We propose OC-VTP, a direct and guaranteed approach to select the most representative vision tokens for high-efficiency yet accuracy-preserving VLM inference. Our OC-VTP requires merely light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner, which can then be inserted into existing VLMs, without fine-tuning of any models on any datasets. It is gauranteed that the most representative vision tokens are kept by minimizing the error in reconstructing the original unpruned tokens from the selected ones. Across any vision pruning ratios, i.e., inference efficiency, our OC-VTP consistently helps mainstream VLMs to preserve the highest inference accuracy. Our pruning also demonstrates interesting interpretability. Our codes are available at https://github.com/GarryLarry010131/OC-VTP.

- **Summary**: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

- **Summary**: The way humans interact with each other, including interpersonal distances, spatial configuration, and motion, varies significantly across different situations. To enable machines to understand such complex, context-dependent behaviors, it is essential to model multiple people in relation to the surrounding scene context. In this paper, we present a novel research problem to model the correlations between two people engaged in a shared interaction involving an object. We refer to this formulation as Human-Human-Object Interactions (HHOIs). To overcome the lack of dedicated datasets for HHOIs, we present a newly captured HHOIs dataset and a method to synthesize HHOI data by leveraging image generative models. As an intermediary, we obtain individual human-object interaction (HOIs) and human-human interaction (HHIs) from the HHOIs, and with these data, we train an text-to-HOI and text-to-HHI model using score-based diffusion model. Finally, we present a unified generative framework that integrates the two individual model, capable of synthesizing complete HHOIs in a single advanced sampling process. Our method extends HHOI generation to multi-human settings, enabling interactions involving more than two individuals. Experimental results show that our method generates realistic HHOIs conditioned on textual descriptions, outperforming previous approaches that focus only on single-human HOIs. Furthermore, we introduce multi-human motion generation involving objects as an application of our framework.

- **Summary**: With advances in satellite constellations, sensor technologies, and imaging pipelines, ultra-high-resolution (Ultra-HR) remote sensing imagery is becoming increasingly widespread. However, current remote sensing foundation models are ill-suited to such inputs: full-image encoding exhausts token and memory budgets, while resize-based preprocessing loses fine-grained and answer-critical details. In this context, guiding the model look where it matters before prediction becomes crucial. Therefore, we present ZoomSearch, a training-free, plug-and-play pipeline that decouples 'where to look' from 'how to answer' for Ultra-HR Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RS-VQA). ZoomSearch combines Adaptive Multi-Branch Zoom Search, which performs a hierarchical search over image patches to localize query-relevant regions, with Layout-Aware Patch Reassembly, which reorganizes the selected patches into a compact, layout-faithful canvas. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Ultra-HR RS-VQA benchmarks MME-RealWorld-RS and LRS-VQA, comparing against (i) strong general foundation models, (ii) remote sensing foundation models, (iii) Ultra-HR RS-VQA methods, and (iv) plug-and-play search-based VQA methods. When integrated with LLaVA-ov, ZoomSearch attains state-of-the-art accuracy across diverse tasks, improving the LLaVA-ov baseline by 26.3% on LRS-VQA and 114.8\% on MME-RealWorld-RS. Meanwhile, it achieves much higher inference efficiency, outperforming prior search-based methods by 20%~44% in speed.

- **Summary**: Normalizing flows (NFs) are end-to-end likelihood-based generative models for continuous data, and have recently regained attention with encouraging progress on image generation. Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models.

- **Summary**: Dance is an essential component of human culture and serves as a tool for conveying emotions and telling stories. Identifying and distinguishing dance genres based on motion data is a complex problem in human activity recognition, as many styles share similar poses, gestures, and temporal motion patterns. This work presents a lightweight framework for classifying dance styles that determines motion characteristics based on pose estimates extracted from videos. We propose temporal-spatial descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis. These features capture local joint dynamics such as velocity, acceleration, and angular movement of the upper body, enabling a structured representation of spatial coordination. To further encode rhythmic and periodic aspects of movement, we integrate Fast Fourier Transform features that characterize movement patterns in the frequency domain. The proposed approach achieves robust classification of different dance styles with low computational effort, as complex model architectures are not required, and shows that interpretable motion representations can effectively capture stylistic nuances.

- **Summary**: Developing comprehensive assistive technologies requires the seamless integration of visual and auditory perception. This research evaluates the feasibility of a modular architecture inspired by core functionalities of perceptive systems like 'Smart Eye.' We propose and benchmark three independent sensing modules: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for eye state detection (drowsiness/attention), a deep CNN for facial expression recognition, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for voice-based speaker identification. Utilizing the Eyes Image, FER2013, and customized audio datasets, our models achieved accuracies of 93.0%, 97.8%, and 96.89%, respectively. This study demonstrates that lightweight, domain-specific models can achieve high fidelity on discrete tasks, establishing a validated foundation for future real-time, multimodal integration in resource-constrained assistive devices.

- **Summary**: Accurate extraction and segmentation of the cerebral arteries from digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences is essential for developing reliable clinical management models of complex cerebrovascular diseases. Conventional loss functions often rely solely on pixel-wise overlap, overlooking the geometric and physical consistency of vascular boundaries, which can lead to fragmented or unstable vessel predictions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Physics-Informed Loss} (PIL) that models the interaction between the predicted and ground-truth boundaries as an elastic process inspired by dislocation theory in materials physics. This formulation introduces a physics-based regularization term that enforces smooth contour evolution and structural consistency, allowing the network to better capture fine vascular geometry. The proposed loss is integrated into several segmentation architectures, including U-Net, U-Net++, SegFormer, and MedFormer, and evaluated on two public benchmarks: DIAS and DSCA. Experimental results demonstrate that PIL consistently outperforms conventional loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Dice, Active Contour, and Surface losses, achieving superior sensitivity, F1 score, and boundary coherence. These findings confirm that the incorporation of physics-based boundary interactions into deep neural networks improves both the precision and robustness of vascular segmentation in dynamic angiographic imaging. The implementation of the proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/irfantahir301/Physicsis_loss.

- **Summary**: Generative models, such as large language models and text-to-image diffusion models, are increasingly used to create visual designs like user interfaces (UIs) and presentation slides. Finetuning and benchmarking these generative models have often relied on datasets of human-annotated design preferences. Yet, due to the subjective and highly personalized nature of visual design, preference varies widely among individuals. In this paper, we study this problem by introducing DesignPref, a dataset of 12k pairwise comparisons of UI design generation annotated by 20 professional designers with multi-level preference ratings. We found that among trained designers, substantial levels of disagreement exist (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25 for binary preferences). Natural language rationales provided by these designers indicate that disagreements stem from differing perceptions of various design aspect importance and individual preferences. With DesignPref, we demonstrate that traditional majority-voting methods for training aggregated judge models often do not accurately reflect individual preferences. To address this challenge, we investigate multiple personalization strategies, particularly fine-tuning or incorporating designer-specific annotations into RAG pipelines. Our results show that personalized models consistently outperform aggregated baseline models in predicting individual designers' preferences, even when using 20 times fewer examples. Our work provides the first dataset to study personalized visual design evaluation and support future research into modeling individual design taste.

- **Summary**: Assessing image-text alignment models such as CLIP is crucial for bridging visual and linguistic representations. Yet existing benchmarks rely on rule-based perturbations or short captions, limiting their ability to measure fine-grained alignment. We introduce AlignBench, a benchmark that provides a new indicator of image-text alignment by evaluating detailed image-caption pairs generated by diverse image-to-text and text-to-image models. Each sentence is annotated for correctness, enabling direct assessment of VLMs as alignment evaluators. Benchmarking a wide range of decoder-based VLMs reveals three key findings: (i) CLIP-based models, even those tailored for compositional reasoning, remain nearly blind; (ii) detectors systematically over-score early sentences; and (iii) they show strong self-preference, favoring their own outputs and harming detection performance. Our project page will be available at https://dahlian00.github.io/AlignBench/.

- **Summary**: Recent unified models integrate understanding experts (e.g., LLMs) with generative experts (e.g., diffusion models), achieving strong multimodal performance. However, recent advanced methods such as BAGEL and LMFusion follow the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) paradigm, adopting a symmetric design that mirrors one expert to another for convenient initialization and fusion, which remains suboptimal due to inherent modality discrepancies. In this work, we propose HBridge, an asymmetric H-shaped architecture that enables heterogeneous experts to optimally leverage pretrained priors from their respective modality domains. Unlike prior dense fusion strategies that straightforwardly connect all layers between experts via shared attention, HBridge selectively bridges intermediate layers, reducing over 40% attention sharing, which improves efficiency and enhances generation quality. Shallow and deep layers, which capture modality-specific representations, are decoupled, while mid-layer bridging promotes semantic alignment. To further strengthen cross-modal coherence, we introduce semantic reconstruction tokens that explicitly guide the generative expert to reconstruct visual semantic tokens of the target image. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of HBridge, establishing a new paradigm for unified multimodal generation.

- **Summary**: We introduce Mistake Attribution (MATT), a task for fine-grained understanding of human mistakes in egocentric video. Unlike prior mistake understanding work, which lacks fine-grained output, MATT concretely attributes mistakes to the input instruction text or the attempt video. MATT determines what part of the instruction is violated (semantic role), when the deviation becomes irreversible (the Point-of-No-Return, PNR), and where the mistake appears in the PNR frame. We develop MisEngine, a data engine that automatically constructs attribution-rich mistake samples from existing datasets and inherits their annotations. Applied to large egocentric corpora, MisEngine yields EPIC-KITCHENS-M and Ego4D-M, two datasets that are up to two orders of magnitude larger than prior mistake datasets. We then present MisFormer, a unified attention-based model for mistake attribution across semantic (what), temporal (when), and spatial (where) dimensions, trained using MisEngine supervision. Experiments on our new datasets and prior benchmarks show that MisFormer outperforms strong video-language, temporal localization, hand-object interaction, and mistake-detection baselines.

- **Summary**: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are powerful generative tools but often produce factually inaccurate outputs due to a lack of robust reasoning capabilities. While extensive research has been conducted on integrating external knowledge for reasoning in large language models (LLMs), such efforts remain underexplored in VLMs, where the challenge is compounded by the need to bridge multiple modalities seamlessly. This work introduces a framework for knowledge-guided reasoning in VLMs, leveraging structured knowledge graphs for multi-hop verification using image-captioning task to illustrate our framework. Our approach enables systematic reasoning across multiple steps, including visual entity recognition, knowledge graph traversal, and fact-based caption refinement. We evaluate the framework using hierarchical, triple-based and bullet-point based knowledge representations, analyzing their effectiveness in factual accuracy and logical inference. Empirical results show that our approach improves factual accuracy by approximately 31% on preliminary experiments on a curated dataset of mixtures from Google Landmarks v2, Conceptual captions and Coco captions revealing key insights into reasoning patterns and failure modes. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating external knowledge for advancing reasoning in VLMs, paving the way for more reliable and knowledgable multimodal systems.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the critical need for automated crack detection in the preservation of cultural heritage through semantic segmentation. We present a comparative study of U-Net architectures, using various convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders, for pixel-level crack identification on statues and monuments. A comparative quantitative evaluation is performed on the test set of the OmniCrack30k dataset [1] using popular segmentation metrics including Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice coefficient, and Jaccard index. This is complemented by an out-of-distribution qualitative evaluation on an unlabeled test set of real-world cracked statues and monuments. Our findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of different CNN- based encoders for fine-grained crack segmentation. We show that the models exhibit promising generalization capabilities to unseen cultural heritage contexts, despite never having been explicitly trained on images of statues or monuments.

- **Summary**: While olfaction is central to how animals perceive the world, this rich chemical sensory modality remains largely inaccessible to machines. One key bottleneck is the lack of diverse, multimodal olfactory training data collected in natural settings. We present New York Smells, a large dataset of paired image and olfactory signals captured ``in the wild.'' Our dataset contains 7,000 smell-image pairs from 3,500 distinct objects across indoor and outdoor environments, with approximately 70$\times$ more objects than existing olfactory datasets. Our benchmark has three tasks: cross-modal smell-to-image retrieval, recognizing scenes, objects, and materials from smell alone, and fine-grained discrimination between grass species. Through experiments on our dataset, we find that visual data enables cross-modal olfactory representation learning, and that our learned olfactory representations outperform widely-used hand-crafted features.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Models have emerged as a leading class of generative models, yet their iterative sampling process remains computationally expensive. Timestep distillation is a promising technique to accelerate generation, but it often requires extensive training and leads to image quality degradation. Furthermore, fine-tuning these distilled models for specific objectives, such as aesthetic appeal or user preference, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously unstable and easily falls into reward hacking. In this work, we introduce Flash-DMD, a novel framework that enables fast convergence with distillation and joint RL-based refinement. Specifically, we first propose an efficient timestep-aware distillation strategy that significantly reduces training cost with enhanced realism, outperforming DMD2 with only $2.1\%$ its training cost. Second, we introduce a joint training scheme where the model is fine-tuned with an RL objective while the timestep distillation training continues simultaneously. We demonstrate that the stable, well-defined loss from the ongoing distillation acts as a powerful regularizer, effectively stabilizing the RL training process and preventing policy collapse. Extensive experiments on score-based and flow matching models show that our proposed Flash-DMD not only converges significantly faster but also achieves state-of-the-art generation quality in the few-step sampling regime, outperforming existing methods in visual quality, human preference, and text-image alignment metrics. Our work presents an effective paradigm for training efficient, high-fidelity, and stable generative models. Codes are coming soon.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in Unified Multimodal Models, yet a fundamental question remains: Does understanding truly inform generation? To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significant understanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions: reasoning generation and knowledge transfer. Specifically, for reasoning generation tasks, we observe that explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that a self-training approach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, for knowledge transfer tasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover that query-based architectures inherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer. UniSandbox provides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.

- **Summary**: While recent video generation models have achieved significant visual fidelity, they often suffer from the lack of explicit physical controllability and plausibility. To address this, some recent studies attempted to guide the video generation with physics-based rendering. However, these methods face inherent challenges in accurately modeling complex physical properties and effectively control ling the resulting physical behavior over extended temporal sequences. In this work, we introduce PhysChoreo, a novel framework that can generate videos with diverse controllability and physical realism from a single image. Our method consists of two stages: first, it estimates the static initial physical properties of all objects in the image through part-aware physical property reconstruction. Then, through temporally instructed and physically editable simulation, it synthesizes high-quality videos with rich dynamic behaviors and physical realism. Experimental results show that PhysChoreo can generate videos with rich behaviors and physical realism, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Transformers have significantly improved video fidelity and temporal coherence, however, practical controllability remains limited. Concise, ambiguous, and compositionally complex user inputs contrast with the detailed prompts used in training, yielding an intent-output mismatch. We propose ReaDe, a universal, model-agnostic interpreter that converts raw instructions into precise, actionable specifications for downstream video generators. ReaDe follows a reason-then-describe paradigm: it first analyzes the user request to identify core requirements and resolve ambiguities, then produces detailed guidance that enables faithful, controllable generation. We train ReaDe via a two-stage optimization: (i) reasoning-augmented supervision imparts analytic parsing with stepwise traces and dense captions, and (ii) a multi-dimensional reward assigner enables stable, feedback-driven refinement for natural-style captions. Experiments across single- and multi-condition scenarios show consistent gains in instruction fidelity, caption accuracy, and downstream video quality, with strong generalization to reasoning-intensive and unseen inputs. ReaDe offers a practical route to aligning controllable video generation with accurately interpreted user intent. Project Page: https://sqwu.top/ReaDe/.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in visual generation have highlighted the rise of Latent Generative Models (LGMs), which rely on effective visual tokenizers to bridge pixels and semantics. However, existing tokenizers are typically trained from scratch and struggle to balance semantic representation and reconstruction fidelity, particularly in high-dimensional latent spaces. In this work, we introduce DINO-Tok, a DINO-based visual tokenizer that unifies hierarchical representations into an information-complete latent space. By integrating shallow features that retain fine-grained details with deep features encoding global semantics, DINO-Tok effectively bridges pretrained representations and visual generation. We further analyze the challenges of vector quantization (VQ) in this high-dimensional space, where key information is often lost and codebook collapse occurs. We thus propose a global PCA reweighting mechanism to stabilize VQ and preserve essential information across dimensions. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, DINO-Tok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, reaching 28.54 PSNR for autoencoding and 23.98 PSNR for VQ-based modeling, significantly outperforming prior tokenizers and comparable to billion-level data trained models (such as Hunyuan and Wan). These results demonstrate that adapting powerful pretrained vision models like DINO for tokenization enables semantically aligned and high-fidelity latent representations, enabling next-generation visual generative models.

- **Summary**: This paper studies Visual Question-Visual Answering (VQ-VA): generating an image, rather than text, in response to a visual question -- an ability that has recently emerged in proprietary systems such as NanoBanana and GPT-Image. To also bring this capability to open-source models, we introduce VQ-VA World, a data-centric framework built around an agentic pipeline for large-scale, targeted data construction. Leveraging web-scale deployment, this pipeline crawls a massive amount of ~1.8M high-quality, interleaved image-text samples for model training. For evaluation, we further release IntelligentBench, a human-curated benchmark that systematically assesses VQ-VA along the aspects of world knowledge, design knowledge, and reasoning. Training with VQ-VA World data yields strong empirical gains: it helps LightFusion attain 53.06 on IntelligentBench, substantially surpassing the best prior open-source baselines (i.e., 7.78 from vanilla LightFusion; 1.94 from UniWorld-V1), and significantly narrowing the gap toward leading proprietary systems (e.g., 81.67 from NanoBanana; 82.64 from GPT-Image). By releasing the full suite of model weights, datasets, and pipelines, we hope to stimulate future research on VQ-VA.

- **Summary**: The recovery of training data from generative models (``model inversion'') has been extensively studied for diffusion models in the data domain. The encoder/decoder pair and corresponding latent codes have largely been ignored by inversion techniques applied to latent space generative models, e.g., Latent Diffusion models (LDMs). In this work we describe two key findings: (1) The diffusion model exhibits non-uniform memorization across latent codes, tending to overfit samples located in high-distortion regions of the decoder pullback metric. (2) Even within a single latent code, different dimensions contribute unequally to memorization. We introduce a principled method to rank latent dimensions by their per-dimensional contribution to the decoder pullback metric, identifying those most responsible for memorization. Empirically, removing less-memorizing dimensions when computing attack statistics for score-based membership inference attacker significantly improves performance, with average AUROC gains of 2.7\% and substantial increases in TPR@1\%FPR (6.42\%) across diverse datasets including CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet-1K, Pokémon, MS-COCO, and Flickr. This indicates stronger confidence in identifying members under extremely low false-positive tolerance. Our results highlight the overlooked influence of the auto-encoder geometry on LDM memorization and provide a new perspective for analyzing privacy risks in diffusion-based generative models.

- **Summary**: We study the optimization of functions with $n>2$ arguments that have a representation as a sum of several functions that have only $2$ of the $n$ arguments each, termed sums of bivariates, on finite domains. The complexity of optimizing sums of bivariates is shown to be NP-equivalent and it is shown that there exists free lunch in the optimization of sums of bivariates. Based on measure-valued extensions of the objective function, so-called relaxations, $\ell^2$-approximation, and entropy-regularization, we derive several tractable problem formulations solvable with linear programming, coordinate ascent as well as with closed-form solutions. The limits of applying tractable versions of such relaxations to sums of bivariates are investigated using general results for reconstructing measures from their bivariate marginals. Experiments in which the derived algorithms are applied to random functions, vertex coloring, and signal reconstruction problems provide insights into qualitatively different function classes that can be modeled as sums of bivariates.

- **Summary**: Previous works have explored various customized generation tasks given a reference image, but they still face limitations in generating consistent fine-grained details. In this paper, our aim is to solve the inconsistency problem of generated images by applying a reference-guided post-editing approach and present our ImageCritic. We first construct a dataset of reference-degraded-target triplets obtained via VLM-based selection and explicit degradation, which effectively simulates the common inaccuracies or inconsistencies observed in existing generation models. Furthermore, building on a thorough examination of the model's attention mechanisms and intrinsic representations, we accordingly devise an attention alignment loss and a detail encoder to precisely rectify inconsistencies. ImageCritic can be integrated into an agent framework to automatically detect inconsistencies and correct them with multi-round and local editing in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImageCritic can effectively resolve detail-related issues in various customized generation scenarios, providing significant improvements over existing methods.

- **Summary**: This study aimed to explore the application of deep neural networks for whole-body human posture prediction during dynamic load-reaching activities. Two time-series models were trained using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and transformer architectures. The dataset consisted of 3D full-body plug-in gait dynamic coordinates from 20 normal-weight healthy male individuals each performing 204 load-reaching tasks from different load positions while adapting various lifting and handling techniques. The model inputs consisted of the 3D position of the hand-load position, lifting (stoop, full-squat and semi-squat) and handling (one- and two-handed) techniques, body weight and height, and the 3D coordinate data of the body posture from the first 25% of the task duration. These inputs were used by the models to predict body coordinates during the remaining 75% of the task period. Moreover, a novel method was proposed to improve the accuracy of the previous and present posture prediction networks by enforcing constant body segment lengths through the optimization of a new cost function. The results indicated that the new cost function decreased the prediction error of the models by approximately 8% and 21% for the arm and leg models, respectively. We indicated that utilizing the transformer architecture, with a root-mean-square-error of 47.0 mm, exhibited ~58% more accurate long-term performance than the BLSTM-based model. This study merits the use of neural networks that capture time series dependencies in 3D motion frames, providing a unique approach for understanding and predict motion dynamics during manual material handling activities.

- **Summary**: Reproducible closed-loop evaluation remains a major bottleneck in Embodied AI such as visual navigation. A promising path forward is high-fidelity simulation that combines photorealistic sensor rendering with geometrically grounded interaction in complex, open-world urban environments. Although recent video-3DGS methods ease open-world scene capturing, they are still unsuitable for benchmarking due to large visual and geometric sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Wanderland, a real-to-sim framework that features multi-sensor capture, reliable reconstruction, accurate geometry, and robust view synthesis. Using this pipeline, we curate a diverse dataset of indoor-outdoor urban scenes and systematically demonstrate how image-only pipelines scale poorly, how geometry quality impacts novel view synthesis, and how all of these adversely affect navigation policy learning and evaluation reliability. Beyond serving as a trusted testbed for embodied navigation, Wanderland's rich raw sensor data further allows benchmarking of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models. Our work establishes a new foundation for reproducible research in open-world embodied AI. Project website is at https://ai4ce.github.io/wanderland/.

- **Summary**: Inspired by generative paradigms in image and video, 3D shape generation has made notable progress, enabling the rapid synthesis of high-fidelity 3D assets from a single image. However, current methods still face challenges, including the lack of intricate details, overly smoothed surfaces, and fragmented thin-shell structures. These limitations leave the generated 3D assets still one step short of meeting the standards favored by artists. In this paper, we present ShapeGen, which achieves high-quality image-to-3D shape generation through 3D representation and supervision improvements, resolution scaling up, and the advantages of linear transformers. These advancements allow the generated assets to be seamlessly integrated into 3D pipelines, facilitating their widespread adoption across various applications. Through extensive experiments, we validate the impact of these improvements on overall performance. Ultimately, thanks to the synergistic effects of these enhancements, ShapeGen achieves a significant leap in image-to-3D generation, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with reward models has advanced alignment of generative models to human aesthetic and perceptual preferences. However, jointly optimizing multiple rewards often incurs an alignment tax, improving one dimension while degrading others. To address this, we introduce two complementary methods: MapReduce LoRA and Reward-aware Token Embedding (RaTE). MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them to refine a shared base model; RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control. Experiments on Text-to-Image generation (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX.1-dev) show improvements of 36.1%, 4.6%, and 55.7%, and 32.7%, 4.3%, and 67.1% on GenEval, PickScore, and OCR, respectively. On Text-to-Video generation (HunyuanVideo), visual and motion quality improve by 48.1% and 90.0%, respectively. On the language task, Helpful Assistant, with Llama-2 7B, helpful and harmless improve by 43.4% and 136.7%, respectively. Our framework sets a new state-of-the-art multi-preference alignment recipe across modalities.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained video models learn powerful priors for generating high-quality, temporally coherent content. While these models excel at temporal coherence, their dynamics are often constrained by the continuous nature of their training data. We hypothesize that by injecting the rich and unconstrained content diversity from image data into this coherent temporal framework, we can generate image sets that feature both natural transitions and a far more expansive dynamic range. To this end, we introduce iMontage, a unified framework designed to repurpose a powerful video model into an all-in-one image generator. The framework consumes and produces variable-length image sets, unifying a wide array of image generation and editing tasks. To achieve this, we propose an elegant and minimally invasive adaptation strategy, complemented by a tailored data curation process and training paradigm. This approach allows the model to acquire broad image manipulation capabilities without corrupting its invaluable original motion priors. iMontage excels across several mainstream many-in-many-out tasks, not only maintaining strong cross-image contextual consistency but also generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional scopes.

- **Summary**: While generative video models have achieved remarkable fidelity and consistency, applying these capabilities to video editing remains a complex challenge. Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a "motion edit" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating "motion counterfactuals", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

- **Summary**: Long-tailed multi-label visual recognition poses a significant challenge, as images typically contain multiple labels with highly imbalanced class distributions, leading to biased models that favor head classes while underperforming on tail classes. Recent efforts have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, alongside long-tailed learning techniques to exploit rich visual-textual priors for improved performance. However, existing methods often derive semantic inter-class relationships directly from imbalanced datasets, resulting in unreliable correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity. Moreover, CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is optimized for single-label image-text matching, making it suboptimal for multi-label tasks. To address these issues, we propose the correlation adaptation prompt network (CAPNET), a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models label correlations from CLIP's textual encoder. The framework incorporates a graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation and learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings. It utilizes a distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting for optimized training under imbalance. Moreover, it improves generalization through test-time ensembling and realigns visual-textual modalities using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to avert overfitting on tail classes without compromising head class performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmarks including VOC-LT, COCO-LT, and NUS-WIDE demonstrate that CAPNET achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness for real-world long-tailed multi-label visual recognition.

- **Summary**: What data should a vision-language model be trained on? To answer this question, many data curation efforts center on the quality of a dataset. However, most of these existing methods are (i) offline, i.e. they produce a static dataset from a set of predetermined filtering criteria, and (ii) concept-agnostic, i.e. they use model-based filters which induce additional data biases. In this work, we go beyond such offline, concept-agnostic methods and advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation. Our first contribution is DataConcept, a collection of 128M web-crawled image-text pairs annotated with fine-grained details about their concept composition. Building on DataConcept, we introduce Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS), a simple yet effective batch sampling framework that flexibly constructs batches on-the-fly based on specific target distributions. We propose two variants: (i) Diversity Maximization (CABS-DM) to curate batches with a broad coverage of available concepts, and (ii) Frequency Maximization (CABS-FM) to curate batches with high object multiplicity. Through extensive evaluations across 28 benchmarks, we demonstrate that our CABS method significantly benefits CLIP/SigLIP model classes and yields highly performant models. Overall, CABS represents a strong open-source alternative to proprietary online data curation algorithms, enabling practitioners to define custom concept distributions that optimize for specific downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Spatial reasoning is a critical capability for intelligent robots, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) still fall short of human-level performance in video-based spatial reasoning. This gap mainly stems from two challenges: a semantic-geometric misalignment that prevents consistent 3D understanding, and the absence of persistent memory to retain 3D representation and understanding over time. To address these limitations, we present VLM$^2$, a Vision-Language Model with persistent Memory for spatial reasoning with a view-consistent, 3D-aware representation purely from 2D video. Specifically, to enhance long-horizon reasoning, we incorporate a dual-memory module, consisting of a working memory that operates as a sliding window to focus on immediate context, and an episodic memory that consolidates and stores critical long-term information. This design enables efficient and long-horizon spatial reasoning with a fixed computational cost. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that VLM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance among video-only models, significantly advancing the frontier of visual-spatial intelligence.

- **Summary**: Latent-space modeling has been the standard for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). However, it relies on a two-stage pipeline where the pretrained autoencoder introduces lossy reconstruction, leading to error accumulation while hindering joint optimization. To address these issues, we propose PixelDiT, a single-stage, end-to-end model that eliminates the need for the autoencoder and learns the diffusion process directly in the pixel space. PixelDiT adopts a fully transformer-based architecture shaped by a dual-level design: a patch-level DiT that captures global semantics and a pixel-level DiT that refines texture details, enabling efficient training of a pixel-space diffusion model while preserving fine details. Our analysis reveals that effective pixel-level token modeling is essential to the success of pixel diffusion. PixelDiT achieves 1.61 FID on ImageNet 256x256, surpassing existing pixel generative models by a large margin. We further extend PixelDiT to text-to-image generation and pretrain it at the 1024x1024 resolution in pixel space. It achieves 0.74 on GenEval and 83.5 on DPG-bench, approaching the best latent diffusion models.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenge of training a single network to jointly perform multiple dense prediction tasks, such as segmentation and depth estimation, i.e., multi-task learning (MTL). Current approaches mainly capture cross-task relations in the 2D image space, often leading to unstructured features lacking 3D-awareness. We argue that 3D-awareness is vital for modeling cross-task correlations essential for comprehensive scene understanding. We propose to address this problem by integrating correlations across views, i.e., cost volume, as geometric consistency in the MTL network. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Cross-view Module (CvM), shared across tasks, to exchange information across views and capture cross-view correlations, integrated with a feature from MTL encoder for multi-task predictions. This module is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to both single and multi-view data. Extensive results on NYUv2 and PASCAL-Context demonstrate that our method effectively injects geometric consistency into existing MTL methods to improve performance.

- **Summary**: While recent text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have achieved impressive quality and prompt alignment, they often produce low-diversity outputs when sampling multiple videos from a single text prompt. We tackle this challenge by formulating it as a set-level policy optimization problem, with the goal of training a policy that can cover the diverse range of plausible outcomes for a given prompt. To address this, we introduce DPP-GRPO, a novel framework for diverse video generation that combines Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) theories to enforce explicit reward on diverse generations. Our objective turns diversity into an explicit signal by imposing diminishing returns on redundant samples (via DPP) while supplies groupwise feedback over candidate sets (via GRPO). Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, and encourages diverse generations across visual appearance, camera motions, and scene structure without sacrificing prompt fidelity or perceptual quality. We implement our method on WAN and CogVideoX, and show that our method consistently improves video diversity on state-of-the-art benchmarks such as VBench, VideoScore, and human preference studies. Moreover, we release our code and a new benchmark dataset of 30,000 diverse prompts to support future research.

- **Summary**: To act in the world, a model must name what it sees and know where it is in 3D. Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 49.89 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +15.51 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes. It also generalizes zero-shot to held-out categories with strong robustness. By turning 3D detection into a disciplined next-token problem, LocateAnything3D offers a practical foundation for models to perceive in 3D.

- **Summary**: Current autoregressive video diffusion models are constrained by three core bottlenecks: (i) the finite temporal horizon imposed by the base model's 3D Rotary Positional Embedding (3D-RoPE), (ii) slow prompt responsiveness in maintaining fine-grained action control during long-form rollouts, and (iii) the inability to realize discontinuous cinematic transitions within a single generation stream. We introduce $\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.

- **Summary**: Traditional object detection models in medical imaging operate within a closed-set paradigm, limiting their ability to detect objects of novel labels. Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) addresses this limitation but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedROV, the first Real-time Open Vocabulary detection model for medical imaging. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we curate a large-scale dataset, Omnis, with 600K detection samples across nine imaging modalities and introduce a pseudo-labeling strategy to handle missing annotations from multi-source datasets. Additionally, we enhance generalization by incorporating knowledge from a large pre-trained foundation model. By leveraging contrastive learning and cross-modal representations, MedROV effectively detects both known and novel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MedROV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation model for medical image detection with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50, and surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS, setting a new benchmark in medical detection. Our source code, dataset, and trained model are available at https://github.com/toobatehreem/MedROV.

- **Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning text-to-image generative models with human preferences. A key challenge, however, lies in designing effective and interpretable rewards. Existing methods often rely on either composite metrics (e.g., CLIP, OCR, and realism scores) with fixed weights or a single scalar reward distilled from human preference models, which can limit interpretability and flexibility. We propose RubricRL, a simple and general framework for rubric-based reward design that offers greater interpretability, composability, and user control. Instead of using a black-box scalar signal, RubricRL dynamically constructs a structured rubric for each prompt--a decomposable checklist of fine-grained visual criteria such as object correctness, attribute accuracy, OCR fidelity, and realism--tailored to the input text. Each criterion is independently evaluated by a multimodal judge (e.g., o4-mini), and a prompt-adaptive weighting mechanism emphasizes the most relevant dimensions. This design not only produces interpretable and modular supervision signals for policy optimization (e.g., GRPO or PPO), but also enables users to directly adjust which aspects to reward or penalize. Experiments with an autoregressive text-to-image model demonstrate that RubricRL improves prompt faithfulness, visual detail, and generalizability, while offering a flexible and extensible foundation for interpretable RL alignment across text-to-image architectures.

- **Summary**: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

- **Summary**: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

- **Summary**: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

- **Summary**: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

- **Summary**: Liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification are critical for clinical assessment and diagnosis. However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors. The code is available at: https://github.com/xiaojiao929/MTI-Net.

- **Summary**: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

- **Summary**: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

- **Summary**: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

- **Summary**: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

- **Summary**: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

- **Summary**: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

- **Summary**: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

- **Summary**: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

- **Summary**: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

- **Summary**: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/gilgoldm/grw-smoothing.

- **Summary**: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

- **Summary**: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

- **Summary**: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.   To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.   Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.
