- **Summary**: This work presents an approach for recognizing isolated sign language gestures using skeleton-based pose data extracted from video sequences. A Graph-GRU temporal network is proposed to model both spatial and temporal dependencies between frames, enabling accurate classification. The model is trained and evaluated on the AUTSL (Ankara university Turkish sign language) dataset, achieving high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating graph-based spatial representations with temporal modeling, providing a scalable framework for sign language recognition. The results of this approach highlight the potential of pose-driven methods for sign language understanding.

- **Summary**: Ambient sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) in smart homes remains challenging due to the need for real-time inference, spatially grounded reasoning, and context-aware temporal modeling. Existing approaches often rely on pre-segmented, within-activity data and overlook the physical layout of the environment, limiting their robustness in continuous, real-world deployments. In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation for medical image segmentation remains a significant challenge due to substantial domain shifts across imaging modalities, such as CT and MRI. While recent vision-language representation learning methods have shown promise, their potential in UDA segmentation tasks remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose TCSA-UDA, a Text-driven Cross-Semantic Alignment framework that leverages domain-invariant textual class descriptions to guide visual representation learning. Our approach introduces a vision-language covariance cosine loss to directly align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, encouraging semantically meaningful and modality-invariant feature representations. Additionally, we incorporate a prototype alignment module that aligns class-wise pixel-level feature distributions across domains using high-level semantic prototypes. This mitigates residual category-level discrepancies and enhances cross-modal consistency. Extensive experiments on challenging cross-modality cardiac, abdominal, and brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our TCSA-UDA framework significantly reduces domain shift and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods, establishing a new paradigm for integrating language-driven semantics into domain-adaptive medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a novel medical imaging modality. One of the established methods for MPI reconstruction is based on the System Matrix (SM). However, the calibration of the SM is often time-consuming and requires repeated measurements whenever the system parameters change. Current methodologies utilize deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) techniques to expedite SM calibration; nevertheless, these strategies do not fully exploit physical prior knowledge associated with the SM, such as symmetric positional priors. Consequently, we integrated positional priors into existing frameworks for SM calibration. Underpinned by theoretical justification, we empirically validated the efficacy of incorporating positional priors through experiments involving both 2D and 3D SM SR methods.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation faces challenges due to variations in anatomical structures. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local features, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers mitigate this issue with self-attention mechanisms but lack the ability to preserve local contextual information. State-of-the-art models primarily follow an encoder-decoder architecture, achieving notable success. However, two key limitations remain: (1) Shallow layers, which are closer to the input, capture fine-grained details but suffer from information loss as data propagates through deeper layers. (2) Inefficient integration of local details and global context between the encoder and decoder stages. To address these challenges, we propose the MACMD-based decoder, which enhances attention mechanisms and facilitates channel mixing between encoder and decoder stages via skip connections. This design leverages hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local contextual details, essential for precise medical image segmentation. We evaluated our approach using multiple transformer encoders on both binary and multi-organ segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Dice score and computational efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving accurate and robust segmentation performance.

### LRANet++: Low-Rank Approximation Network for Accurate and Efficient Text Spotting

- **Summary**: End-to-end text spotting aims to jointly optimize text detection and recognition within a unified framework. Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LRANet++ compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The quadratic compute and memory costs of global self-attention severely limit its use in high-resolution images. Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\times$ and $18\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

- **Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) can remotely extract physiological signals from RGB video, which has many advantages in detecting heart rate, such as low cost and no invasion to patients. The existing rPPG model is usually based on the transformer module, which has low computation efficiency. Recently, the Mamba model has garnered increasing attention due to its efficient performance in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating potential as a substitute for transformer-based algorithms. However, the Mambaout model and its variants prove that the SSM module, which is the core component of the Mamba model, is unnecessary for the vision task. Therefore, we hope to prove the feasibility of using the Mambaout-based module to remotely learn the heart rate. Specifically, we propose a novel rPPG algorithm called uncomplicated and enhanced learning capability rPPG (TYrPPG). This paper introduces an innovative gated video understanding block (GVB) designed for efficient analysis of RGB videos. Based on the Mambaout structure, this block integrates 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN to enhance video understanding for analysis. In addition, we propose a comprehensive supervised loss function (CSL) to improve the model's learning capability, along with its weakly supervised variants. The experiments show that our TYrPPG can achieve state-of-the-art performance in commonly used datasets, indicating its prospects and superiority in remote heart rate estimation.

- **Summary**: Image Coding for Machines (ICM) has become increasingly important with the rapid integration of computer vision into real-world applications. However, most ICM frameworks utilize learned image compression (LIC) models that operate at a fixed rate and require separate training for each target bitrate, which may limit their practical applications. Existing variable rate LIC approaches mitigate this limitation but typically depend on training, increasing computational cost and deployment complexity. Moreover, variable rate control has not been thoroughly explored for ICM. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free, adaptive quantization step size control scheme that enables flexible bitrate adjustment. By leveraging both channel-wise entropy dependencies and spatial scale parameters predicted by the hyperprior network, the proposed method preserves semantically important regions while coarsely quantizing less critical areas. The bitrate can be continuously controlled through a single parameter. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving up to 11.07% BD-rate savings over the non-adaptive variable rate method.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder for which early detection is critical. Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.

- **Summary**: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.

- **Summary**: The effective segmentation of 3D data is crucial for a wide range of industrial applications, especially for detecting subtle defects in the field of integrated circuits (IC). Ceramic package substrates (CPS), as an important electronic material, are essential in IC packaging owing to their superior physical and chemical properties. However, the complex structure and minor defects of CPS, along with the absence of a publically available dataset, significantly hinder the development of CPS surface defect detection. In this study, we construct a high-quality point cloud dataset for 3D segmentation of surface defects in CPS, i.e., CPS3D-Seg, which has the best point resolution and precision compared to existing 3D industrial datasets. CPS3D-Seg consists of 1300 point cloud samples under 20 product categories, and each sample provides accurate point-level annotations. Meanwhile, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark based on SOTA point cloud segmentation algorithms to validate the effectiveness of CPS3D-Seg. Additionally, we propose a novel 3D segmentation method based on causal inference (CINet), which quantifies potential confounders in point clouds through Structural Refine (SR) and Quality Assessment (QA) Modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CINet significantly outperforms existing algorithms in both mIoU and accuracy.



### Towards Personalized Quantum Federated Learning for Anomaly Detection

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection has a significant impact on applications such as video surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial monitoring, where anomalies frequently depend on context and anomaly-labeled data are limited. Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23%, and achieves gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled the creation of high-quality images and videos, but have also raised significant safety concerns regarding the generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.

- **Summary**: A Light Field (LF) camera consists of an additional two-dimensional array of micro-lenses placed between the main lens and sensor, compared to a conventional camera. The sensor pixels under each micro-lens receive light from a sub-aperture of the main lens. This enables the image sensor to capture both spatial information and the angular resolution of a scene point. This additional angular information is used to estimate the depth of a 3-D scene. The continuum of virtual viewpoints in light field data enables efficient depth estimation using Epipolar Line Images (EPIs) with robust occlusion handling. However, the trade-off between angular information and spatial information is very critical and depends on the focal position of the camera. To design, develop, implement, and test novel disparity-based light field depth estimation algorithms, the availability of suitable light field image datasets is essential. In this paper, a publicly available light field image dataset is introduced and thoroughly described. We have also demonstrated the effect of focal position on the disparity of a 3-D point as well as the shortcomings of the currently available light field dataset. The proposed dataset contains 285 light field images captured using a Lytro Illum LF camera and 13 synthetic LF images. The proposed dataset also comprises a synthetic dataset with similar disparity characteristics to those of a real light field camera. A real and synthetic stereo light field dataset is also created by using a mechanical gantry system and Blender. The dataset is available at https://github.com/aupendu/light-field-dataset.

- **Summary**: Post-training quantization offers an efficient pathway to deploy super-resolution models, yet existing methods treat weight and activation quantization independently, missing their critical interplay. Through controlled experiments on SwinIR, we uncover a striking asymmetry: weight quantization primarily degrades structural similarity, while activation quantization disproportionately affects pixel-level accuracy. This stems from their distinct roles--weights encode learned restoration priors for textures and edges, whereas activations carry input-specific intensity information. Building on this insight, we propose HarmoQ, a unified framework that harmonizes quantization across components through three synergistic steps: structural residual calibration proactively adjusts weights to compensate for activation-induced detail loss, harmonized scale optimization analytically balances quantization difficulty via closed-form solutions, and adaptive boundary refinement iteratively maintains this balance during optimization. Experiments show HarmoQ achieves substantial gains under aggressive compression, outperforming prior art by 0.46 dB on Set5 at 2-bit while delivering 3.2x speedup and 4x memory reduction on A100 GPUs. This work provides the first systematic analysis of weight-activation coupling in super-resolution quantization and establishes a principled solution for efficient high-quality image restoration.

- **Summary**: Endoscopic images often suffer from diverse and co-occurring degradations such as low lighting, smoke, and bleeding, which obscure critical clinical details. Existing restoration methods are typically task-specific and often require prior knowledge of the degradation type, limiting their robustness in real-world clinical use. We propose EndoIR, an all-in-one, degradation-agnostic diffusion-based framework that restores multiple degradation types using a single model. EndoIR introduces a Dual-Domain Prompter that extracts joint spatial-frequency features, coupled with an adaptive embedding that encodes both shared and task-specific cues as conditioning for denoising. To mitigate feature confusion in conventional concatenation-based conditioning, we design a Dual-Stream Diffusion architecture that processes clean and degraded inputs separately, with a Rectified Fusion Block integrating them in a structured, degradation-aware manner. Furthermore, Noise-Aware Routing Block improves efficiency by dynamically selecting only noise-relevant features during denoising. Experiments on SegSTRONG-C and CEC datasets demonstrate that EndoIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple degradation scenarios while using fewer parameters than strong baselines, and downstream segmentation experiments confirm its clinical utility.

- **Summary**: Social platforms connect billions of people, yet their engagement-first algorithms often work on users rather than with them, amplifying stress, misinformation, and a loss of control. We propose Human-Layer AI (HL-AI)--user-owned, explainable intermediaries that sit in the browser between platform logic and the interface. HL-AI gives people practical, moment-to-moment control without requiring platform cooperation. We contribute a working Chrome/Edge prototype implementing five representative pattern frameworks--Context-Aware Post Rewriter, Post Integrity Meter, Granular Feed Curator, Micro-Withdrawal Agent, and Recovery Mode--alongside a unifying mathematical formulation balancing user utility, autonomy costs, and risk thresholds. Evaluation spans technical accuracy, usability, and behavioral outcomes. The result is a suite of humane controls that help users rewrite before harm, read with integrity cues, tune feeds with intention, pause compulsive loops, and seek shelter during harassment, all while preserving agency through explanations and override options. This prototype offers a practical path to retrofit today's feeds with safety, agency, and well-being, inviting rigorous cross-cultural user evaluation.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has significantly propelled progress in Multi-View Clustering (MVC). However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/MoEGCL.

- **Summary**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are inherently corrupted by speckle noise, limiting their utility in high-precision applications. While deep learning methods have shown promise in SAR despeckling, most methods employ a single unified network to process the entire image, failing to account for the distinct speckle statistics associated with different spatial physical characteristics. It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images validate the superior performance of the proposed model in noise removal and structural preservation.

- **Summary**: Low-rank sparse regression models have been widely applied in the field of face recognition. To further address the challenges caused by complex occlusions and illumination variations, this paper proposes a Hybrid Second-Order Gradient Histogram based Global Low-Rank Sparse Regression (H2H-GLRSR) model. Specifically, a novel feature descriptor called the Hybrid Second-Order Gradient Histogram (H2H) is first designed to more effectively characterize the local structural features of facial images. Then, this descriptor is integrated with the Sparse Regularized Nuclear Norm based Matrix Regression (SR$\_$NMR). Moreover, a global low-rank constraint is imposed on the residual matrix, enabling the model to better capture the global correlations inherent in structured noise. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing regression-based classification approaches under challenging scenarios involving occlusions, illumination changes, and unconstrained environments.

- **Summary**: Understanding 3D scenes in open-world settings poses fundamental challenges for vision and robotics, particularly due to the limitations of closed-vocabulary supervision and static annotations. To address this, we propose a unified framework for Open-World 3D Scene Graph Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning, which enables generalizable and interactive 3D scene understanding. Our method integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with retrieval-based reasoning to support multimodal exploration and language-guided interaction. The framework comprises two key components: (1) a dynamic scene graph generation module that detects objects and infers semantic relationships without fixed label sets, and (2) a retrieval-augmented reasoning pipeline that encodes scene graphs into a vector database to support text/image-conditioned queries. We evaluate our method on 3DSSG and Replica benchmarks across four tasks-scene question answering, visual grounding, instance retrieval, and task planning-demonstrating robust generalization and superior performance in diverse environments. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining open-vocabulary perception with retrieval-based reasoning for scalable 3D scene understanding.

- **Summary**: Despite the effectiveness of quantization-aware training (QAT) in compressing deep neural networks, its performance on multi-task architectures often degrades significantly due to task-specific feature discrepancies and gradient conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Aware Balanced Feature Fusion (GABFusion), which dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features in a quantization-friendly manner. We further introduce Attention Distribution Alignment (ADA), a feature-level distillation strategy tailored for quantized models. Our method demonstrates strong generalization across network architectures and QAT algorithms, with theoretical guarantees on gradient bias reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategy consistently enhances a variety of QAT methods across different network architectures and bit-widths. On PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, the proposed approach achieves average mAP improvements of approximately 3.3% and 1.6%, respectively. When applied to YOLOv5 under 4-bit quantization, our method narrows the accuracy gap with the full-precision model to only 1.7% on VOC, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving performance under low-bit constraints. Notably, the proposed framework is modular, easy to integrate, and compatible with any existing QAT technique-enhancing the performance of quantized models without requiring modifications to the original network architecture.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), the mechanistic interpretability remains underexplored. Existing analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and lack examination covering visual and textual tokens, model components, and the full range of layers. This limitation restricts actionable insights to improve the faithfulness of model output and the development of downstream tasks, such as hallucination mitigation. To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance.

- **Summary**: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) achieve self-supervised learning of image representations by randomly removing a portion of visual tokens and reconstructing the original image as a pretext task, thereby significantly enhancing pretraining efficiency and yielding excellent adaptability across downstream tasks. However, MAE and other MAE-style paradigms that adopt random masking generally require more pre-training epochs to maintain adaptability. Meanwhile, ViT in MAE suffers from inefficient parameter use due to fixed spatial resolution across layers. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Complementary Masked Autoencoders (CoMA), which employ a complementary masking strategy to ensure uniform sampling across all pixels, thereby improving effective learning of all features and enhancing the model's adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce DyViT, a hierarchical vision transformer that employs a Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention (DM-MSA), significantly reducing the parameters and FLOPs while improving fine-grained feature learning. Pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with CoMA, DyViT matches the downstream performance of MAE using only 12% of the pre-training epochs, demonstrating more effective learning. It also attains a 10% reduction in pre-training time per epoch, further underscoring its superior pre-training efficiency.

- **Summary**: Generative modeling frameworks have emerged as an effective approach to capture high-dimensional image distributions from large datasets without requiring domain-specific knowledge, a capability essential for longitudinal disease progression modeling. Recent generative modeling approaches have attempted to capture progression by mapping images into a latent representational space and then controlling and guiding the representations to generate follow-up images from a baseline image. However, existing approaches impose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with limited controllability to generate follow-up images without explicit supervision from subject-specific longitudinal images. In order to enable controlled movements in the latent representational space and generate progression images from a baseline image in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework. The explicit encoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle information relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space to condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for generating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to a subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject identity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating with progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for Alzheimer's progression modeling and longitudinal image generation.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) extends traditional SGG by recognizing novel objects and relationships beyond predefined categories, leveraging the knowledge from pre-trained large-scale models. Existing OVSGG methods always adopt a two-stage pipeline: 1) \textit{Infusing knowledge} into large-scale models via pre-training on large datasets; 2) \textit{Transferring knowledge} from pre-trained models with fully annotated scene graphs during supervised fine-tuning. However, due to a lack of explicit interaction modeling, these methods struggle to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting instances of the same object category. This limitation induces critical issues in both stages of OVSGG: it generates noisy pseudo-supervision from mismatched objects during knowledge infusion, and causes ambiguous query matching during knowledge transfer. To this end, in this paper, we propose an inter\textbf{AC}tion-\textbf{C}entric end-to-end OVSGG framework (\textbf{ACC}) in an interaction-driven paradigm to minimize these mismatches. For \textit{interaction-centric knowledge infusion}, ACC employs a bidirectional interaction prompt for robust pseudo-supervision generation to enhance the model's interaction knowledge. For \textit{interaction-centric knowledge transfer}, ACC first adopts interaction-guided query selection that prioritizes pairing interacting objects to reduce interference from non-interacting ones. Then, it integrates interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to bolster robustness by pushing relational foreground away from the background while retaining general knowledge. Extensive experimental results on three benchmarks show that ACC achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of interaction-centric paradigms for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Facial expression recognition, as a vital computer vision task, is garnering significant attention and undergoing extensive research. Although facial expression recognition algorithms demonstrate impressive performance on high-resolution images, their effectiveness tends to degrade when confronted with low-resolution images. We find it is because: 1) low-resolution images lack detail information; 2) current methods complete weak global modeling, which make it difficult to extract discriminative features. To alleviate the above issues, we proposed a novel global multiple extraction network (GME-Net) for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which incorporates 1) a hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module with attention similarity knowledge distillation to learn image details from high-resolution network; 2) a multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure to mitigate the influence of local image noise and facilitate capturing global image features. As a result, our GME-Net is capable of extracting expression-related discriminative features. Extensive experiments conducted on several widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed GME-Net can better recognize low-resolution facial expression and obtain superior performance than existing solutions.

- **Summary**: The perception of high-definition maps is an integral component of environmental perception in autonomous driving systems. Existing research have often focused on online construction of high-definition maps. For instance, the Maptr[9] series employ a detection-based method to output vectorized map instances parallelly in an end-to-end manner. However, despite their capability for real-time construction, detection-based methods are observed to lack robust generalizability[19], which hampers their applicability in auto-labeling systems. Therefore, aiming to improve the generalizability, we reinterpret road elements as rasterized polygons and design a concise framework based on instance segmentation. Initially, a segmentation-based transformer is employed to deliver instance masks in an end-to-end manner; succeeding this step, a Potrace-based[17] post-processing module is used to ultimately yield vectorized map elements. Quantitative results attained on the Nuscene[1] dataset substantiate the effectiveness and generaliz-ability of our method.

- **Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an emerging contactless physiological sensing technique that leverages subtle color variations in facial videos to estimate vital signs such as heart rate and respiratory rate. This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED).

- **Summary**: Stereo image matching is a fundamental task in computer vision, photogrammetry and remote sensing, but there is an almost unexplored field, i.e., polygon matching, which faces the following challenges: disparity discontinuity, scale variation, training requirement, and generalization. To address the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes a novel U(PM)$^2$: low-cost unsupervised polygon matching with pre-trained models by uniting automatically learned and handcrafted features, of which pipeline is as follows: firstly, the detector leverages the pre-trained segment anything model to obtain masks; then, the vectorizer converts the masks to polygons and graphic structure; secondly, the global matcher addresses challenges from global viewpoint changes and scale variation based on bidirectional-pyramid strategy with pre-trained LoFTR; finally, the local matcher further overcomes local disparity discontinuity and topology inconsistency of polygon matching by local-joint geometry and multi-feature matching strategy with Hungarian algorithm. We benchmark our U(PM)$^2$ on the ScanNet and SceneFlow datasets using our proposed new metric, which achieved state-of-the-art accuracy at a competitive speed and satisfactory generalization performance at low cost without any training requirement.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates how visual texture presentation influences tactile perception when interacting with electrostatic cloth displays. We propose a visuo-haptic system that allows users to pinch and rub virtual fabrics while feeling realistic frictional sensations modulated by electrostatic actuation. Through a user study, we examined the cross-modal effects between visual roughness and perceived tactile friction. The results demonstrate that visually rough textures amplify the perceived frictional force, even under identical electrostatic stimuli. These findings contribute to the understanding of multimodal texture perception and provide design insights for haptic feedback in virtual material interfaces.

- **Summary**: A person's gaze offers valuable insights into their focus of attention, level of social engagement, and confidence. In this work, we investigate how contextual cues combined with visual scene and facial information can be effectively utilized to predict and interpret social gaze patterns during conversational interactions. We introduce CSGaze, a context aware multimodal approach that leverages facial, scene information as complementary inputs to enhance social gaze pattern prediction from multi-person images. The model also incorporates a fine-grained attention mechanism centered on the principal speaker, which helps in better modeling social gaze dynamics. Experimental results show that CSGaze performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods on GP-Static, UCO-LAEO and AVA-LAEO. Our findings highlight the role of contextual cues in improving social gaze prediction. Additionally, we provide initial explainability through generated attention scores, offering insights into the model's decision-making process. We also demonstrate our model's generalizability by testing our model on open set datasets that demonstrating its robustness across diverse scenarios.

- **Summary**: Typical detection-free methods for image-to-point cloud registration leverage transformer-based architectures to aggregate cross-modal features and establish correspondences. However, they often struggle under challenging conditions, where noise disrupts similarity computation and leads to incorrect correspondences. Moreover, without dedicated designs, it remains difficult to effectively select informative and correlated representations across modalities, thereby limiting the robustness and accuracy of registration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-modal registration framework composed of two key modules: the Iterative Agents Selection (IAS) module and the Reliable Agents Interaction (RAI) module. IAS enhances structural feature awareness with phase maps and employs reinforcement learning principles to efficiently select reliable agents. RAI then leverages these selected agents to guide cross-modal interactions, effectively reducing mismatches and improving overall robustness. Extensive experiments on the RGB-D Scenes v2 and 7-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

- **Summary**: Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high sensitivity for breast cancer detection, but interpretation is time-consuming. Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI. Further research is warranted before clinical implementation.

- **Summary**: The integration of medical images with clinical context is essential for generating accurate and clinically interpretable radiology reports. However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in perception systems for safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, DNNs remain vulnerable to various safety concerns, including generalization errors, out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, and adversarial attacks, which can lead to hazardous failures. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of runtime safety monitoring approaches, which operate in parallel to DNNs during inference to detect these safety concerns without modifying the DNN itself. We categorize existing methods into three main groups: Monitoring inputs, internal representations, and outputs. We analyze the state-of-the-art for each category, identify strengths and limitations, and map methods to the safety concerns they address. In addition, we highlight open challenges and future research directions.

- **Summary**: In breast ultrasound images, precise lesion segmentation is essential for early diagnosis; however, low contrast, speckle noise, and unclear boundaries make this difficult. Even though deep learning models have demonstrated potential, standard convolutional architectures frequently fall short in capturing enough global context, resulting in segmentations that are anatomically inconsistent. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a flexible, conditional Denoising Diffusion Model that combines an enhanced UNet-based generative decoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for global feature extraction. We introduce three primary innovations: 1) an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge (ACB) for efficient, multi-scale fusion of semantic features; 2) a novel Topological Denoising Consistency (TDC) loss component that regularizes training by penalizing structural inconsistencies during denoising; and 3) a dual-head architecture that leverages the denoising objective as a powerful regularizer, enabling a lightweight auxiliary head to perform rapid and accurate inference on smaller datasets and a noise prediction head. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art on public breast ultrasound datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM. Comprehensive ablation studies empirically validate that the model components are critical for achieving these results and for producing segmentations that are not only accurate but also anatomically plausible.

- **Summary**: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life and robotic manipulation tasks. However, compared to rigid objects, pose tracking for articulated objects remains an underexplored problem due to their inherent kinematic constraints. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel point-pair-based pose tracking framework, termed \textbf{PPF-Tracker}. The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of PPF-Tracker in multi-frame pose tracking of articulated objects. We believe this work can foster advances in robotics, embodied intelligence, and augmented reality. Codes are available at https://github.com/mengxh20/PPFTracker.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-to-image models have enabled a new era of creative and controllable image generation. However, generating compositional scenes with multiple subjects and attributes remains a significant challenge. To enhance user control over subject placement, several layout-guided methods have been proposed. However, these methods face numerous challenges, particularly in compositional scenes. Unintended subjects often appear outside the layouts, generated images can be out-of-distribution and contain unnatural artifacts, or attributes bleed across subjects, leading to incorrect visual outputs. In this work, we propose MALeR, a method that addresses each of these challenges. Given a text prompt and corresponding layouts, our method prevents subjects from appearing outside the given layouts while being in-distribution. Additionally, we propose a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism that prevents attribute leakage, enabling accurate rendering of subjects with multiple attributes, even in complex compositional scenes. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves superior performance in compositional accuracy, generation consistency, and attribute binding compared to previous work. MALeR is particularly adept at generating images of scenes with multiple subjects and multiple attributes per subject.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed across downstream tasks, yet their training data often encode social biases that surface in outputs. Unlike humans, who interpret images through contextual and social cues, VLMs process them through statistical associations, often leading to reasoning that diverges from human reasoning. By analyzing how a VLM reasons, we can understand how inherent biases are perpetuated and can adversely affect downstream performance. To examine this gap, we systematically analyze social biases in five open-source VLMs for an occupation prediction task, on the FairFace dataset. Across 32 occupations and three different prompting styles, we elicit both predictions and reasoning. Our findings reveal that the biased reasoning patterns systematically underlie intersectional disparities, highlighting the need to align VLM reasoning with human values prior to its downstream deployment.

- **Summary**: Medical image denoising is essential for improving image quality while minimizing the exposure of sensitive information, particularly when working with large-scale clinical datasets. This study explores distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset, using additive Gaussian noise as a lightweight obfuscation technique. We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels. This indicates U-Net++'s enhanced structural fidelity and low perceptual similarity. Meanwhile, our optimized training pipeline reduces training time by over 60% for both models compared to single-GPU training, and outperforms standard DataParallel by over 40%, with only a minor accuracy drop for both models (trading some accuracy for speed). These findings highlight the effectiveness of software-level optimization in distributed learning for medical imaging. This work demonstrates the practical viability of combining architectural design, lightweight obfuscation, and advanced distributed training strategies to accelerate and enhance medical image processing pipelines in real-world clinical and research environments.

- **Summary**: Edge computing in person re-identification (ReID) is crucial for reducing the load on central cloud servers and ensuring user privacy. Conventional compression methods for obtaining compact models require computations for each individual student model. When multiple models of varying sizes are needed to accommodate different resource conditions, this leads to repetitive and cumbersome computations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge inheritance approach named OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer), which consolidates the knowledge of the teacher model into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain. When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation. OSKT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression methods, with the added advantage of one-time knowledge transfer that eliminates the need for frequent computations for each target model.

- **Summary**: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) remains a cornerstone in video enhancement, enabling temporal upscaling for tasks like slow-motion rendering, frame rate conversion, and video restoration. While classical methods rely on optical flow and learning-based models assume access to dense ground-truth, both struggle with occlusions, domain shifts, and ambiguous motion. This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation. Our model eliminates the need for explicit motion estimation by combining a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision. Our framework is evaluated on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets. MiVID is trained entirely on CPU using the datasets and 9-frame video segments, making it a low-resource yet highly effective pipeline. Despite these constraints, our model achieves optimal results at just 50 epochs, competitive with several supervised baselines.This work demonstrates the power of self-supervised diffusion priors for temporally coherent frame synthesis and provides a scalable path toward accessible and generalizable VFI systems.

- **Summary**: Visual place recognition (VPR) is typically regarded as a specific image retrieval task, whose core lies in representing images as global descriptors. Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

- **Summary**: The raw depth images captured by RGB-D cameras using Time-of-Flight (TOF) or structured light often suffer from incomplete depth values due to weak reflections, boundary shadows, and artifacts, which limit their applications in downstream vision tasks. Existing methods address this problem through depth completion in the image domain, but they overlook the physical characteristics of raw depth images. It has been observed that the presence of invalid depth areas alters the frequency distribution pattern. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) to harmonize the advantages of both spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. Specifically, we consider the distinct properties of amplitude and phase spectra and devise a dedicated spectral fusion module. Meanwhile, the local and global correlations between spatial-domain and frequency-domain features are calculated in a unified embedding space. The gradual mutual representation and refinement encourage the network to fully explore complementary physical characteristics and priors for more accurate depth completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed S2ML method, outperforming the state-of-the-art method CFormer by 0.828 dB and 0.834 dB on the NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Streaming free-viewpoint video~(FVV) in real-time still faces significant challenges, particularly in training, rendering, and transmission efficiency. Harnessing superior performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting~(3DGS), recent 3DGS-based FVV methods have achieved notable breakthroughs in both training and rendering. However, the storage requirements of these methods can reach up to $10$MB per frame, making stream FVV in real-time impossible. To address this problem, we propose a novel FVV representation, dubbed StreamSTGS, designed for real-time streaming. StreamSTGS represents a dynamic scene using canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. For high compression efficiency, we encode canonical Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal features as a video. This design not only enables real-time streaming, but also inherently supports adaptive bitrate control based on network condition without any extra training. Moreover, we propose a sliding window scheme to aggregate adjacent temporal features to learn local motions, and then introduce a transformer-guided auxiliary training module to learn global motions. On diverse FVV benchmarks, StreamSTGS demonstrates competitive performance on all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StreamSTGS increases the PSNR by an average of $1$dB while reducing the average frame size to just $170$KB. The code is publicly available on https://github.com/kkkzh/StreamSTGS.

- **Summary**: We introduce Neodragon, a text-to-video system capable of generating 2s (49 frames @24 fps) videos at the 640x1024 resolution directly on a Qualcomm Hexagon NPU in a record 6.7s (7 FPS). Differing from existing transformer-based offline text-to-video generation models, Neodragon is the first to have been specifically optimised for mobile hardware to achieve efficient and high-fidelity video synthesis. We achieve this through four key technical contributions: (1) Replacing the original large 4.762B T5xxl Text-Encoder with a much smaller 0.2B DT5 (DistilT5) with minimal quality loss, enabled through a novel Text-Encoder Distillation procedure. (2) Proposing an Asymmetric Decoder Distillation approach allowing us to replace the native codec-latent-VAE decoder with a more efficient one, without disturbing the generative latent-space of the generation pipeline. (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks within the denoiser backbone based on their relative importance, with recovery of original performance through a two-stage distillation process. (4) Reducing the NFE (Neural Functional Evaluation) requirement of the denoiser by performing step distillation using DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching, thereby substantially accelerating video generation. When paired with an optimised SSD1B first-frame image generator and QuickSRNet for 2x super-resolution, our end-to-end Neodragon system becomes a highly parameter (4.945B full model), memory (3.5GB peak RAM usage), and runtime (6.7s E2E latency) efficient mobile-friendly model, while achieving a VBench total score of 81.61. By enabling low-cost, private, and on-device text-to-video synthesis, Neodragon democratizes AI-based video content creation, empowering creators to generate high-quality videos without reliance on cloud services. Code and model will be made publicly available at our website: https://qualcomm-ai-research.github.io/neodragon

- **Summary**: Remote identity verification is essential for modern digital security; however, it remains highly vulnerable to sophisticated Presentation Attacks (PAs) that utilise forged or manipulated identity documents. Although Deep Learning (DL) has driven advances in Presentation Attack Detection (PAD), the field is fundamentally limited by a lack of data and the poor generalisation of models across various document types and new attack methods.   This article presents a systematic literature review (SLR) conducted in accordance with the PRISMA methodology, aiming to analyse and synthesise the current state of AI-based PAD for identity documents from 2020 to 2025 comprehensively. Our analysis reveals a significant methodological evolution: a transition from standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to specialised forensic micro-artefact analysis, and more recently, the adoption of large-scale Foundation Models (FMs), marking a substantial shift in the field.   We identify a central paradox that hinders progress: a critical "Reality Gap" exists between models validated on extensive, private datasets and those assessed using limited public datasets, which typically consist of mock-ups or synthetic data. This gap limits the reproducibility of research results. Additionally, we highlight a "Synthetic Utility Gap," where synthetic data generation the primary academic response to data scarcity often fails to predict forensic utility. This can lead to model overfitting to generation artefacts instead of the actual attack.   This review consolidates our findings, identifies critical research gaps, and provides a definitive reference framework that outlines a prescriptive roadmap for future research aimed at developing secure, robust, and globally generalizable PAD systems.

- **Summary**: Exposure correction is essential for enhancing image quality under challenging lighting conditions. While supervised learning has achieved significant progress in this area, it relies heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain in practical scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a pseudo label-based unsupervised method called LoopExpose for arbitrary-length exposure correction. A nested loop optimization strategy is proposed to address the exposure correction problem, where the correction model and pseudo-supervised information are jointly optimized in a two-level framework. Specifically, the upper-level trains a correction model using pseudo-labels generated through multi-exposure fusion at the lower level. A feedback mechanism is introduced where corrected images are fed back into the fusion process to refine the pseudo-labels, creating a self-reinforcing learning loop. Considering the dominant role of luminance calibration in exposure correction, a Luminance Ranking Loss is introduced to leverage the relative luminance ordering across the input sequence as a self-supervised constraint. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoopExpose achieves superior exposure correction and fusion performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

- **Summary**: We present the Multivariate Variational Autoencoder (MVAE), a VAE variant that preserves Gaussian tractability while lifting the diagonal posterior restriction. MVAE factorizes each posterior covariance, where a \emph{global} coupling matrix $\mathbf{C}$ induces dataset-wide latent correlations and \emph{per-sample} diagonal scales modulate local uncertainty. This yields a full-covariance family with analytic KL and an efficient reparameterization via $\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{C}\mathrm{diag}(\boldsymbolσ)$. Across Larochelle-style MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, MVAE consistently matches or improves reconstruction (MSE~$\downarrow$) and delivers robust gains in calibration (NLL/Brier/ECE~$\downarrow$) and unsupervised structure (NMI/ARI~$\uparrow$) relative to diagonal-covariance VAEs with matched capacity, especially at mid-range latent sizes. Latent-plane visualizations further indicate smoother, more coherent factor traversals and sharper local detail. We release a fully reproducible implementation with training/evaluation scripts and sweep utilities to facilitate fair comparison and reuse.

- **Summary**: This paper describes an artificial intelligence-based assistant application, AIDEN, developed during 2023 and 2024, aimed at improving the quality of life for visually impaired individuals. Visually impaired individuals face challenges in identifying objects, reading text, and navigating unfamiliar environments, which can limit their independence and reduce their quality of life. Although solutions such as Braille, audio books, and screen readers exist, they may not be effective in all situations. This application leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to identify and describe objects, read text, and answer questions about the environment. Specifically, it uses You Only Look Once architectures and a Large Language and Vision Assistant. The system incorporates several methods to facilitate the user's interaction with the system and access to textual and visual information in an appropriate manner. AIDEN aims to enhance user autonomy and access to information, contributing to an improved perception of daily usability, as supported by user feedback.

- **Summary**: Motion blur in scene text images severely impairs readability and hinders the reliability of computer vision tasks, including autonomous driving, document digitization, and visual information retrieval. Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms. These results highlight the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the CNN-ViT hybrid design, establishing its practicality for real-world motion-blurred scene-text restoration.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a disentangled latent optimization-based method for parameterizing grouped deforming 3D objects into shape and deformation factors in an unsupervised manner. Our approach involves the joint optimization of a generator network along with the shape and deformation factors, supported by specific regularization techniques. For efficient amortized inference of disentangled shape and deformation codes, we train two order-invariant PoinNet-based encoder networks in the second stage of our method. We demonstrate several significant downstream applications of our method, including unsupervised deformation transfer, deformation classification, and explainability analysis. Extensive experiments conducted on 3D human, animal, and facial expression datasets demonstrate that our simple approach is highly effective in these downstream tasks, comparable or superior to existing methods with much higher complexity.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in inverse problem solving have increasingly adopted flow priors over diffusion models due to their ability to construct straight probability paths from noise to data, thereby enhancing efficiency in both training and inference. However, current flow-based inverse solvers face two primary limitations: (i) they operate directly in pixel space, which demands heavy computational resources for training and restricts scalability to high-resolution images, and (ii) they employ guidance strategies with prior-agnostic posterior covariances, which can weaken alignment with the generative trajectory and degrade posterior coverage. In this paper, we propose LFlow (Latent Refinement via Flows), a training-free framework for solving linear inverse problems via pretrained latent flow priors. LFlow leverages the efficiency of flow matching to perform ODE sampling in latent space along an optimal path. This latent formulation further allows us to introduce a theoretically grounded posterior covariance, derived from the optimal vector field, enabling effective flow guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art latent diffusion solvers in reconstruction quality across most tasks. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/hosseinaskari-cs/LFlow .

- **Summary**: Spatial Reasoning is an important component of human cognition and is an area in which the latest Vision-language models (VLMs) show signs of difficulty. The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.). Our results highlight these challenges and behaviors and provide insight into research gaps and future directions.



### Real-Time Bundle Adjustment for Ultra-High-Resolution UAV Imagery Using Adaptive Patch-Based Feature Tracking

- **Summary**: Real-time processing of UAV imagery is crucial for applications requiring urgent geospatial information, such as disaster response, where rapid decision-making and accurate spatial data are essential. However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection. Validation on MACS datasets with 50MP images demonstrates that the method maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, running full bundle adjustment in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration.

- **Summary**: Early diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children plays a crucial role in improving outcomes in education and mental health. Diagnosing ADHD using neuroimaging data, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous presentations and overlapping symptoms with other conditions. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning approach that adapts a large-scale 3D convolutional foundation model, pre-trained on CT images, to an MRI-based ADHD classification task. Our method introduces Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in 3D by factorizing 3D convolutional kernels into 2D low-rank updates, dramatically reducing trainable parameters while achieving superior performance. In a five-fold cross-validated evaluation on a public diffusion MRI database, our 3D LoRA fine-tuning strategy achieved state-of-the-art results, with one model variant reaching 71.9% accuracy and another attaining an AUC of 0.716. Both variants use only 1.64 million trainable parameters (over 113x fewer than a fully fine-tuned foundation model). Our results represent one of the first successful cross-modal (CT-to-MRI) adaptations of a foundation model in neuroimaging, establishing a new benchmark for ADHD classification while greatly improving efficiency.
