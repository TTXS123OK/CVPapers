- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have a major impact on our society because of the numerous services they provide. On the other hand, they require considerable computing power. To satisfy these requirements, it is possible to use graphic processing units (GPUs). However, high power consumption and limited external IOs constrain their usability and suitability in industrial and mission-critical scenarios. Recently, the number of researches that utilize FPGAs to implement CNNs are increasing rapidly. This is due to the lower power consumption and easy reconfigurability offered by these platforms. Because of the research efforts put into topics such as architecture, synthesis and optimization, some new challenges are arising to integrate such hardware solutions to high-level machine learning software libraries. This paper introduces an integrated framework (CNN2Gate) that supports compilation of a CNN model for an FPGA target. CNN2Gate exploits the OpenCL synthesis workflow for FPGAs offered by commercial vendors. CNN2Gate is capable of parsing CNN models from several popular high-level machine learning libraries such as Keras, Pytorch, Caffe2 etc. CNN2Gate extracts computation flow of layers, in addition to weights and biases and applies a "given" fixed-point quantization. Furthermore, it writes this information in the proper format for OpenCL synthesis tools that are then used to build and run the project on FPGA. CNN2Gate performs design-space exploration using a reinforcement learning agent and fits the design on different FPGAs with limited logic resources automatically. This paper reports results of automatic synthesis and design-space exploration of AlexNet and VGG-16 on various Intel FPGA platforms. CNN2Gate achieves a latency of 205 ms for VGG-16 and 18 ms for AlexNet on the FPGA.

- **Summary**: Caricature, a type of exaggerated artistic portrait, amplifies the distinctive, yet nuanced traits of human faces. This task is typically left to artists, as it has proven difficult to capture subjects' unique characteristics well using automated methods. Recent development of deep end-to-end methods has achieved promising results in capturing style and higher-level exaggerations. However, a key part of caricatures, face warping, has remained challenging for these systems. In this work, we propose AutoToon, the first supervised deep learning method that yields high-quality warps for the warping component of caricatures. Completely disentangled from style, it can be paired with any stylization method to create diverse caricatures. In contrast to prior art, we leverage an SENet and spatial transformer module and train directly on artist warping fields, applying losses both prior to and after warping. As shown by our user studies, we achieve appealing exaggerations that amplify distinguishing features of the face while preserving facial detail.

- **Summary**: Object detection is an important task in remote sensing image analysis. To reduce the computational complexity of redundant information and improve the efficiency of image processing, visual saliency models have been widely applied in this field. In this paper, a novel saliency detection model based on Contrast-weighted Dictionary Learning (CDL) is proposed for remote sensing images. Specifically, the proposed CDL learns salient and non-salient atoms from positive and negative samples to construct a discriminant dictionary, in which a contrast-weighted term is proposed to encourage the contrast-weighted patterns to be present in the learned salient dictionary while discouraging them from being present in the non-salient dictionary. Then, we measure the saliency by combining the coefficients of the sparse representation (SR) and reconstruction errors. Furthermore, by using the proposed joint saliency measure, a variety of saliency maps are generated based on the discriminant dictionary. Finally, a fusion method based on global gradient optimization is proposed to integrate multiple saliency maps. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Video super-resolution (VSR) and frame interpolation (FI) are traditional computer vision problems, and the performance have been improving by incorporating deep learning recently. In this paper, we investigate the problem of jointly upsampling videos both in space and time, which is becoming more important with advances in display systems. One solution for this is to run VSR and FI, one by one, independently. This is highly inefficient as heavy deep neural networks (DNN) are involved in each solution. To this end, we propose an end-to-end DNN framework for the space-time video upsampling by efficiently merging VSR and FI into a joint framework. In our framework, a novel weighting scheme is proposed to fuse input frames effectively without explicit motion compensation for efficient processing of videos. The results show better results both quantitatively and qualitatively, while reducing the computation time (x7 faster) and the number of parameters (30%) compared to baselines.

- **Summary**: In open set recognition, deep neural networks encounter object classes that were unknown during training. Existing open set classifiers distinguish between known and unknown classes by measuring distance in a network's logit space, assuming that known classes cluster closer to the training data than unknown classes. However, this approach is applied post-hoc to networks trained with cross-entropy loss, which does not guarantee this clustering behaviour. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Class Anchor Clustering (CAC) loss. CAC is a distance-based loss that explicitly trains known classes to form tight clusters around anchored class-dependent centres in the logit space. We show that training with CAC achieves state-of-the-art performance for distance-based open set classifiers on all six standard benchmark datasets, with a 15.2% AUROC increase on the challenging TinyImageNet, without sacrificing classification accuracy. We also show that our anchored class centres achieve higher open set performance than learnt class centres, particularly on object-based datasets and large numbers of training classes.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an efficient method for robust 3D self-portraits using a single RGBD camera. Benefiting from the proposed PIFusion and lightweight bundle adjustment algorithm, our method can generate detailed 3D self-portraits in seconds and shows the ability to handle subjects wearing extremely loose clothes. To achieve highly efficient and robust reconstruction, we propose PIFusion, which combines learning-based 3D recovery with volumetric non-rigid fusion to generate accurate sparse partial scans of the subject. Moreover, a non-rigid volumetric deformation method is proposed to continuously refine the learned shape prior. Finally, a lightweight bundle adjustment algorithm is proposed to guarantee that all the partial scans can not only "loop" with each other but also remain consistent with the selected live key observations. The results and experiments show that the proposed method achieves more robust and efficient 3D self-portraits compared with state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recently, works on improving the naturalness of stitching images gain more and more extensive attention. Previous methods suffer the failures of severe projective distortion and unnatural rotation, especially when the number of involved images is large or images cover a very wide field of view. In this paper, we propose a novel natural image stitching method, which takes into account the guidance of vanishing points to tackle the mentioned failures. Inspired by a vital observation that mutually orthogonal vanishing points in Manhattan world can provide really useful orientation clues, we design a scheme to effectively estimate prior of image similarity. Given such estimated prior as global similarity constraints, we feed it into a popular mesh deformation framework to achieve impressive natural stitching performances. Compared with other existing methods, including APAP, SPHP, AANAP, and GSP, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative experiments on natural image stitching.

- **Summary**: Artificially crafted images such as memes, seasonal greetings, etc are flooding the social media platforms today. These eventually start occupying a lot of internal memory of smartphones and it gets cumbersome for the user to go through hundreds of images and delete these synthetic images. To address this, we propose a novel method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the on-device filtering of social media images by classifying these synthetic images and allowing the user to delete them in one go. The custom model uses depthwise separable convolution layers to achieve low inference time on smartphones. We have done an extensive evaluation of our model on various camera image datasets to cover most aspects of images captured by a camera. Various sorts of synthetic social media images have also been tested. The proposed solution achieves an accuracy of 98.25% on the Places-365 dataset and 95.81% on the Synthetic image dataset that we have prepared containing 30K instances.

- **Summary**: City models and height maps of urban areas serve as a valuable data source for numerous applications, such as disaster management or city planning. While this information is not globally available, it can be substituted by digital surface models (DSMs), automatically produced from inexpensive satellite imagery. However, stereo DSMs often suffer from noise and blur. Furthermore, they are heavily distorted by vegetation, which is of lesser relevance for most applications. Such basic models can be filtered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on labels derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) and 3D city models, in order to obtain a refined DSM. We propose a modular multi-task learning concept that consolidates existing approaches into a generalized framework. Our encoder-decoder models with shared encoders and multiple task-specific decoders leverage roof type classification as a secondary task and multiple objectives including a conditional adversarial term. The contributing single-objective losses are automatically weighted in the final multi-task loss function based on learned uncertainty estimates. We evaluated the performance of specific instances of this family of network architectures. Our method consistently outperforms the state of the art on common data, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and generalizes well to a new dataset of an independent study area.

- **Summary**: Development of either drought-resistant or drought-tolerant varieties in rice (Oryza sativa L.), especially for high yield in the context of climate change, is a crucial task across the world. The need for high yielding rice varieties is a prime concern for developing nations like India, China, and other Asian-African countries where rice is a primary staple food. The present investigation is carried out for discriminating drought tolerant, and susceptible genotypes. A total of 150 genotypes were grown under controlled conditions to evaluate at High Throughput Plant Phenomics facility, Nanaji Deshmukh Plant Phenomics Centre, Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. A subset of 10 genotypes is taken out of 150 for the current investigation. To discriminate against the genotypes, we considered features such as the number of leaves per plant, the convex hull and convex hull area of a plant-convex hull formed by joining the tips of the leaves, the number of leaves per unit convex hull of a plant, canopy spread - vertical spread, and horizontal spread of a plant. We trained You Only Look Once (YOLO) deep learning algorithm for leaves tips detection and to estimate the number of leaves in a rice plant. With this proposed framework, we screened the genotypes based on selected traits. These genotypes were further grouped among different groupings of drought-tolerant and drought susceptible genotypes using the Ward method of clustering.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present a simple and effective deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for video deblurring. The proposed algorithm mainly consists of optical flow estimation from intermediate latent frames and latent frame restoration steps. It first develops a deep CNN model to estimate optical flow from intermediate latent frames and then restores the latent frames based on the estimated optical flow. To better explore the temporal information from videos, we develop a temporal sharpness prior to constrain the deep CNN model to help the latent frame restoration. We develop an effective cascaded training approach and jointly train the proposed CNN model in an end-to-end manner. We show that exploring the domain knowledge of video deblurring is able to make the deep CNN model more compact and efficient. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets as well as real-world videos.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) have gained increasing attention for its low power consumption. But training SNN is challenging. Liquid State Machine (LSM), as a major type of Reservoir computing, has been widely recognized for its low training cost among SNNs. The exploration of LSM topology for enhancing performance often requires hyper-parameter search, which is both resource-expensive and time-consuming. We explore the influence of input scale reduction on LSM instead. There are two main reasons for studying input reduction of LSM. One is that the input dimension of large images requires efficient processing. Another one is that input exploration is generally more economic than architecture search. To mitigate the difficulty in effectively dealing with huge input spaces of LSM, and to find that whether input reduction can enhance LSM performance, we explore several input patterns, namely fullscale, scanline, chessboard, and patch. Several datasets have been used to evaluate the performance of the proposed input patterns, including two spatio image datasets and one spatio-temporal image database. The experimental results show that the reduced input under chessboard pattern improves the accuracy by up to 5%, and reduces execution time by up to 50% with up to 75\% less input storage than the fullscale input pattern for LSM.

- **Summary**: Both acoustic and visual information influence human perception of speech. For this reason, the lack of audio in a video sequence determines an extremely low speech intelligibility for untrained lip readers. In this paper, we present a way to synthesise speech from the silent video of a talker using deep learning. The system learns a mapping function from raw video frames to acoustic features and reconstructs the speech with a vocoder synthesis algorithm. To improve speech reconstruction performance, our model is also trained to predict text information in a multi-task learning fashion and it is able to simultaneously reconstruct and recognise speech in real time. The results in terms of estimated speech quality and intelligibility show the effectiveness of our method, which exhibits an improvement over existing video-to-speech approaches.

- **Summary**: This paper describes a simple technique to analyze Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and create interpretable controls for image synthesis, such as change of viewpoint, aging, lighting, and time of day. We identify important latent directions based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) applied either in latent space or feature space. Then, we show that a large number of interpretable controls can be defined by layer-wise perturbation along the principal directions. Moreover, we show that BigGAN can be controlled with layer-wise inputs in a StyleGAN-like manner. We show results on different GANs trained on various datasets, and demonstrate good qualitative matches to edit directions found through earlier supervised approaches.

- **Journal**: IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), 2020, pp. 1116-1121
- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles need to have a semantic understanding of the three-dimensional world around them in order to reason about their environment. State of the art methods use deep neural networks to predict semantic classes for each point in a LiDAR scan. A powerful and efficient way to process LiDAR measurements is to use two-dimensional, image-like projections. In this work, we perform a comprehensive experimental study of image-based semantic segmentation architectures for LiDAR point clouds. We demonstrate various techniques to boost the performance and to improve runtime as well as memory constraints.   First, we examine the effect of network size and suggest that much faster inference times can be achieved at a very low cost to accuracy. Next, we introduce an improved point cloud projection technique that does not suffer from systematic occlusions. We use a cyclic padding mechanism that provides context at the horizontal field-of-view boundaries. In a third part, we perform experiments with a soft Dice loss function that directly optimizes for the intersection-over-union metric. Finally, we propose a new kind of convolution layer with a reduced amount of weight-sharing along one of the two spatial dimensions, addressing the large difference in appearance along the vertical axis of a LiDAR scan. We propose a final set of the above methods with which the model achieves an increase of 3.2% in mIoU segmentation performance over the baseline while requiring only 42% of the original inference time.

- **Summary**: Rapid progress in deep learning is continuously making it easier and cheaper to generate video forgeries. Hence, it becomes very important to have a reliable way of detecting these forgeries. This paper describes such an approach for various tampering scenarios. The problem is modelled as a per-frame binary classification task. We propose to use transfer learning from face recognition task to improve tampering detection on many different facial manipulation scenarios. Furthermore, in low resolution settings, where single frame detection performs poorly, we try to make use of neighboring frames for middle frame classification. We evaluate both approaches on the public FaceForensics benchmark, achieving state of the art accuracy.

- **Summary**: As scene segmentation systems reach visually accurate results, many recent papers focus on making these network architectures faster, smaller and more efficient. In particular, studies often aim at designingreal-time'systems. Achieving this goal is particularly relevant in the context of real-time video understanding for autonomous vehicles, and robots. In this paper, we argue that the commonly used performance metric of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) does not fully capture the information required to estimate the true performance of these networks when they operate inreal-time'. We propose a change of objective in the segmentation task, and its associated metric that encapsulates this missing information in the following way: We propose to predict the future output segmentation map that will match the future input frame at the time when the network finishes the processing. We introduce the associated latency-aware metric, from which we can determine a ranking. We perform latency timing experiments of some recent networks on different hardware and assess the performances of these networks on our proposed task. We propose improvements to scene segmentation networks to better perform on our task by using multi-frames input and increasing capacity in the initial convolutional layers.

- **Summary**: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, officially declared a global pandemic, has a severe impact on our daily lives. As of this writing there are approximately 197,188 confirmed cases of which 80,881 are in "Mainland China" with 7,949 deaths, a mortality rate of 3.4%. In order to support radiologists in this overwhelming challenge, we develop a deep learning based algorithm that can detect, localize and quantify severity of COVID-19 manifestation from chest CT scans. The algorithm is comprised of a pipeline of image processing algorithms which includes lung segmentation, 2D slice classification and fine grain localization. In order to further understand the manifestations of the disease, we perform unsupervised clustering of abnormal slices. We present our results on a dataset comprised of 110 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Zhejiang province, China.

- **Summary**: Graph convolution operators bring the advantages of deep learning to a variety of graph and mesh processing tasks previously deemed out of reach. With their continued success comes the desire to design more powerful architectures, often by adapting existing deep learning techniques to non-Euclidean data. In this paper, we argue geometry should remain the primary driving force behind innovation in the emerging field of geometric deep learning. We relate graph neural networks to widely successful computer graphics and data approximation models: radial basis functions (RBFs). We conjecture that, like RBFs, graph convolution layers would benefit from the addition of simple functions to the powerful convolution kernels. We introduce affine skip connections, a novel building block formed by combining a fully connected layer with any graph convolution operator. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique and show the improved performance is the consequence of more than the increased number of parameters. Operators equipped with the affine skip connection markedly outperform their base performance on every task we evaluated, i.e., shape reconstruction, dense shape correspondence, and graph classification. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in graph neural networks.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present an approach and a benchmark for visual reasoning in robotics applications, in particular small object grasping and manipulation. The approach and benchmark are focused on inferring object properties from visual and text data. It concerns small household objects with their properties, functionality, natural language descriptions as well as question-answer pairs for visual reasoning queries along with their corresponding scene semantic representations. We also present a method for generating synthetic data which allows to extend the benchmark to other objects or scenes and propose an evaluation protocol that is more challenging than in the existing datasets. We propose a reasoning system based on symbolic program execution. A disentangled representation of the visual and textual inputs is obtained and used to execute symbolic programs that represent a 'reasoning process' of the algorithm. We perform a set of experiments on the proposed benchmark and compare to results for the state of the art methods. These results expose the shortcomings of the existing benchmarks that may lead to misleading conclusions on the actual performance of the visual reasoning systems.

- **Summary**: We combine ideas from shock graph theory with more recent appearance-based methods for medial axis extraction from complex natural scenes, improving upon the present best unsupervised method, in terms of efficiency and performance. We make the following specific contributions: i) we extend the shock graph representation to the domain of real images, by generalizing the shock type definitions using local, appearance-based criteria; ii) we then use the rules of a Shock Grammar to guide our search for medial points, drastically reducing run time when compared to other methods, which exhaustively consider all points in the input image;iii) we remove the need for typical post-processing steps including thinning, non-maximum suppression, and grouping, by adhering to the Shock Grammar rules while deriving the medial axis solution; iv) finally, we raise some fundamental concerns with the evaluation scheme used in previous work and propose a more appropriate alternative for assessing the performance of medial axis extraction from scenes. Our experiments on the BMAX500 and SK-LARGE datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We outperform the present state-of-the-art, excelling particularly in the high-precision regime, while running an order of magnitude faster and requiring no post-processing.

- **Summary**: Scene, as the crucial unit of storytelling in movies, contains complex activities of actors and their interactions in a physical environment. Identifying the composition of scenes serves as a critical step towards semantic understanding of movies. This is very challenging -- compared to the videos studied in conventional vision problems, e.g. action recognition, as scenes in movies usually contain much richer temporal structures and more complex semantic information. Towards this goal, we scale up the scene segmentation task by building a large-scale video dataset MovieScenes, which contains 21K annotated scene segments from 150 movies. We further propose a local-to-global scene segmentation framework, which integrates multi-modal information across three levels, i.e. clip, segment, and movie. This framework is able to distill complex semantics from hierarchical temporal structures over a long movie, providing top-down guidance for scene segmentation. Our experiments show that the proposed network is able to segment a movie into scenes with high accuracy, consistently outperforming previous methods. We also found that pretraining on our MovieScenes can bring significant improvements to the existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Collecting fine-grained labels usually requires expert-level domain knowledge and is prohibitive to scale up. In this paper, we propose Attribute Mix, a data augmentation strategy at attribute level to expand the fine-grained samples. The principle lies in that attribute features are shared among fine-grained sub-categories, and can be seamlessly transferred among images. Toward this goal, we propose an automatic attribute mining approach to discover attributes that belong to the same super-category, and Attribute Mix is operated by mixing semantically meaningful attribute features from two images. Attribute Mix is a simple but effective data augmentation strategy that can significantly improve the recognition performance without increasing the inference budgets. Furthermore, since attributes can be shared among images from the same super-category, we further enrich the training samples with attribute level labels using images from the generic domain. Experiments on widely used fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: We present an approach to perform 3D pose estimation of multiple people from a few calibrated camera views. Our architecture, leveraging the recently proposed unprojection layer, aggregates feature-maps from a 2D pose estimator backbone into a comprehensive representation of the 3D scene. Such intermediate representation is then elaborated by a fully-convolutional volumetric network and a decoding stage to extract 3D skeletons with sub-voxel accuracy. Our method achieves state of the art MPJPE on the CMU Panoptic dataset using a few unseen views and obtains competitive results even with a single input view. We also assess the transfer learning capabilities of the model by testing it against the publicly available Shelf dataset obtaining good performance metrics. The proposed method is inherently efficient: as a pure bottom-up approach, it is computationally independent of the number of people in the scene. Furthermore, even though the computational burden of the 2D part scales linearly with the number of input views, the overall architecture is able to exploit a very lightweight 2D backbone which is orders of magnitude faster than the volumetric counterpart, resulting in fast inference time. The system can run at 6 FPS, processing up to 10 camera views on a single 1080Ti GPU.

- **Summary**: Massive semantically labeled datasets are readily available for 2D images, however, are much harder to achieve for 3D scenes. Objects in 3D repositories like ShapeNet are labeled, but regrettably only in isolation, so without context. 3D scenes can be acquired by range scanners on city-level scale, but much fewer with semantic labels. Addressing this disparity, we introduce a new optimization procedure, which allows training for 3D detection with raw 3D scans while using as little as 5% of the object labels and still achieve comparable performance. Our optimization uses two networks. A scene network maps an entire 3D scene to a set of 3D object centers. As we assume the scene not to be labeled by centers, no classic loss, such as Chamfer can be used to train it. Instead, we use another network to emulate the loss. This loss network is trained on a small labeled subset and maps a non centered 3D object in the presence of distractions to its own center. This function is very similar - and hence can be used instead of - the gradient the supervised loss would provide. Our evaluation documents competitive fidelity at a much lower level of supervision, respectively higher quality at comparable supervision.

- **Summary**: Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has abruptly and undoubtedly changed the world as we know it at the end of the 2nd decade of the 21st century. COVID-19 is extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early diagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health care professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test, however, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity. Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other hand, reveal specific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung infections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging. Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases. CNNs, however, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and require large datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of handling small datasets, which is of significant importance due to sudden and rapid emergence of COVID-19. Our results based on a dataset of X-ray images show that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous CNN-based models. COVID-CAPS achieved an Accuracy of 95.7%, Sensitivity of 90%, Specificity of 95.8%, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97, while having far less number of trainable parameters in comparison to its counterparts. To further improve diagnosis capabilities of the COVID-CAPS, pre-training based on a new dataset constructed from an external dataset of X-ray images. Pre-training with a dataset of similar nature further improved accuracy to 98.3% and specificity to 98.6%.

- **Summary**: Vision-and-language navigation requires an agent to navigate through a real 3D environment following natural language instructions. Despite significant advances, few previous works are able to fully utilize the strong correspondence between the visual and textual sequences. Meanwhile, due to the lack of intermediate supervision, the agent's performance at following each part of the instruction cannot be assessed during navigation. In this work, we focus on the granularity of the visual and language sequences as well as the traceability of agents through the completion of an instruction. We provide agents with fine-grained annotations during training and find that they are able to follow the instruction better and have a higher chance of reaching the target at test time. We enrich the benchmark dataset Room-to-Room (R2R) with sub-instructions and their corresponding paths. To make use of this data, we propose effective sub-instruction attention and shifting modules that select and attend to a single sub-instruction at each time-step. We implement our sub-instruction modules in four state-of-the-art agents, compare with their baseline models, and show that our proposed method improves the performance of all four agents.   We release the Fine-Grained R2R dataset (FGR2R) and the code at https://github.com/YicongHong/Fine-Grained-R2R.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we bring together two divergent strands of research: photometric face capture and statistical 3D face appearance modelling. We propose a novel lightstage capture and processing pipeline for acquiring ear-to-ear, truly intrinsic diffuse and specular albedo maps that fully factor out the effects of illumination, camera and geometry. Using this pipeline, we capture a dataset of 50 scans and combine them with the only existing publicly available albedo dataset (3DRFE) of 23 scans. This allows us to build the first morphable face albedo model. We believe this is the first statistical analysis of the variability of facial specular albedo maps. This model can be used as a plug in replacement for the texture model of the Basel Face Model (BFM) or FLAME and we make the model publicly available. We ensure careful spectral calibration such that our model is built in a linear sRGB space, suitable for inverse rendering of images taken by typical cameras. We demonstrate our model in a state of the art analysis-by-synthesis 3DMM fitting pipeline, are the first to integrate specular map estimation and outperform the BFM in albedo reconstruction.

- **Summary**: LiDAR is an important method for autonomous driving systems to sense the environment. The point clouds obtained by LiDAR typically exhibit sparse and irregular distribution, thus posing great challenges to the detection of 3D objects, especially those that are small and distant. To tackle this difficulty, we propose Reconfigurable Voxels, a new approach to constructing representations from 3D point clouds. Specifically, we devise a biased random walk scheme, which adaptively covers each neighborhood with a fixed number of voxels based on the local spatial distribution and produces a representation by integrating the points in the chosen neighbors. We found empirically that this approach effectively improves the stability of voxel features, especially for sparse regions. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Lyft, and KITTI, show that this new representation can remarkably improve the detection performance for small and distant objects, without incurring noticeable overhead costs.

- **Summary**: (This paper was submitted as an invited paper to IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering on April 6, 2020.) The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delination of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging and radiology fighting against COVID-19.

- **Summary**: Recovering the scene depth from a single image is an ill-posed problem that requires additional priors, often referred to as monocular depth cues, to disambiguate different 3D interpretations. In recent works, those priors have been learned in an end-to-end manner from large datasets by using deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose guiding depth estimation to favor planar structures that are ubiquitous especially in indoor environments. This is achieved by incorporating a non-local coplanarity constraint to the network with a novel attention mechanism called depth-attention volume (DAV). Experiments on two popular indoor datasets, namely NYU-Depth-v2 and ScanNet, show that our method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation results while using only a fraction of the number of parameters needed by the competing methods.

- **Summary**: Automatic designing computationally efficient neural networks has received much attention in recent years. Existing approaches either utilize network pruning or leverage the network architecture search methods. This paper presents a new framework named network adjustment, which considers network accuracy as a function of FLOPs, so that under each network configuration, one can estimate the FLOPs utilization ratio (FUR) for each layer and use it to determine whether to increase or decrease the number of channels on the layer. Note that FUR, like the gradient of a non-linear function, is accurate only in a small neighborhood of the current network. Hence, we design an iterative mechanism so that the initial network undergoes a number of steps, each of which has a small `adjusting rate' to control the changes to the network. The computational overhead of the entire search process is reasonable, i.e., comparable to that of re-training the final model from scratch. Experiments on standard image classification datasets and a wide range of base networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which consistently outperforms the pruning counterpart. The code is available at https://github.com/danczs/NetworkAdjustment.

- **Summary**: Multi-class 3D object detection aims to localize and classify objects of multiple categories from point clouds. Due to the nature of point clouds, i.e. unstructured, sparse and noisy, some features benefit-ting multi-class discrimination are underexploited, such as shape information. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D shape signature to explore the shape information from point clouds. By incorporating operations of symmetry, convex hull and chebyshev fitting, the proposed shape sig-nature is not only compact and effective but also robust to the noise, which serves as a soft constraint to improve the feature capability of multi-class discrimination. Based on the proposed shape signature, we develop the shape signature networks (SSN) for 3D object detection, which consist of pyramid feature encoding part, shape-aware grouping heads and explicit shape encoding objective. Experiments show that the proposed method performs remarkably better than existing methods on two large-scale datasets. Furthermore, our shape signature can act as a plug-and-play component and ablation study shows its effectiveness and good scalability

- **Summary**: With the rapid emergence of deep learning (DL) technology, it has been successfully used in various fields including aquaculture. This change can create new opportunities and a series of challenges for information and data processing in smart fish farming. This paper focuses on the applications of DL in aquaculture, including live fish identification, species classification, behavioral analysis, feeding decision-making, size or biomass estimation, water quality prediction. In addition, the technical details of DL methods applied to smart fish farming are also analyzed, including data, algorithms, computing power, and performance. The results of this review show that the most significant contribution of DL is the ability to automatically extract features. However, challenges still exist; DL is still in an era of weak artificial intelligence. A large number of labeled data are needed for training, which has become a bottleneck restricting further DL applications in aquaculture. Nevertheless, DL still offers breakthroughs in the handling of complex data in aquaculture. In brief, our purpose is to provide researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the current state of the art of DL in aquaculture, which can provide strong support for the implementation of smart fish farming.

- **Summary**: Over the last decades, the world has been witnessing growing threats to the security in urban spaces, which has augmented the relevance given to visual surveillance solutions able to detect, track and identify persons of interest in crowds. In particular, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a potential tool for this kind of analysis, as they provide a cheap way for data collection, cover large and difficult-to-reach areas, while reducing human staff demands. In this context, all the available datasets are exclusively suitable for the pedestrian re-identification problem, in which the multi-camera views per ID are taken on a single day, and allows the use of clothing appearance features for identification purposes. Accordingly, the main contributions of this paper are two-fold: 1) we announce the UAV-based P-DESTRE dataset, which is the first of its kind to provide consistent ID annotations across multiple days, making it suitable for the extremely challenging problem of person search, i.e., where no clothing information can be reliably used. Apart this feature, the P-DESTRE annotations enable the research on UAV-based pedestrian detection, tracking, re-identification and soft biometric solutions; and 2) we compare the results attained by state-of-the-art pedestrian detection, tracking, reidentification and search techniques in well-known surveillance datasets, to the effectiveness obtained by the same techniques in the P-DESTRE data. Such comparison enables to identify the most problematic data degradation factors of UAV-based data for each task, and can be used as baselines for subsequent advances in this kind of technology.

- **Summary**: Compressed sensing can decrease scanning transmission electron microscopy electron dose and scan time with minimal information loss. Traditionally, sparse scans used in compressed sensing sample a static set of probing locations. However, dynamic scans that adapt to specimens are expected to be able to match or surpass the performance of static scans as static scans are a subset of possible dynamic scans. Thus, we present a prototype for a contiguous sparse scan system that piecewise adapts scan paths to specimens as they are scanned. Sampling directions for scan segments are chosen by a recurrent neural network based on previously observed scan segments. The recurrent neural network is trained by reinforcement learning to cooperate with a feedforward convolutional neural network that completes the sparse scans. This paper presents our learning policy, experiments, and example partial scans, and discusses future research directions.

- **Summary**: Natural scene understanding is a challenging task, particularly when encountering images of multiple objects that are partially occluded. This obstacle is given rise by varying object ordering and positioning. Existing scene understanding paradigms are able to parse only the visible parts, resulting in incomplete and unstructured scene interpretation. In this paper, we investigate the problem of scene de-occlusion, which aims to recover the underlying occlusion ordering and complete the invisible parts of occluded objects. We make the first attempt to address the problem through a novel and unified framework that recovers hidden scene structures without ordering and amodal annotations as supervisions. This is achieved via Partial Completion Network (PCNet)-mask (M) and -content (C), that learn to recover fractions of object masks and contents, respectively, in a self-supervised manner. Based on PCNet-M and PCNet-C, we devise a novel inference scheme to accomplish scene de-occlusion, via progressive ordering recovery, amodal completion and content completion. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes demonstrate the superior performance of our approach to other alternatives. Remarkably, our approach that is trained in a self-supervised manner achieves comparable results to fully-supervised methods. The proposed scene de-occlusion framework benefits many applications, including high-quality and controllable image manipulation and scene recomposition (see Fig. 1), as well as the conversion of existing modal mask annotations to amodal mask annotations.

- **Summary**: The spatio-temporal information among video sequences is significant for video super-resolution (SR). However, the spatio-temporal information cannot be fully used by existing video SR methods since spatial feature extraction and temporal motion compensation are usually performed sequentially. In this paper, we propose a deformable 3D convolution network (D3Dnet) to incorporate spatio-temporal information from both spatial and temporal dimensions for video SR. Specifically, we introduce deformable 3D convolution (D3D) to integrate deformable convolution with 3D convolution, obtaining both superior spatio-temporal modeling capability and motion-aware modeling flexibility. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of D3D in exploiting spatio-temporal information. Comparative results show that our network achieves state-of-the-art SR performance.

- **Summary**: Pneumonia is one of the foremost lung diseases and untreated pneumonia will lead to serious threats for all age groups. The proposed work aims to extract and evaluate the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused pneumonia infection in lung using CT scans. We propose an image-assisted system to extract COVID-19 infected sections from lung CT scans (coronal view). It includes following steps: (i) Threshold filter to extract the lung region by eliminating possible artifacts; (ii) Image enhancement using Harmony-Search-Optimization and Otsu thresholding; (iii) Image segmentation to extract infected region(s); and (iv) Region-of-interest (ROI) extraction (features) from binary image to compute level of severity. The features that are extracted from ROI are then employed to identify the pixel ratio between the lung and infection sections to identify infection level of severity. The primary objective of the tool is to assist the pulmonologist not only to detect but also to help plan treatment process. As a consequence, for mass screening processing, it will help prevent diagnostic burden.

- **Summary**: The resolution of GPS measurements, especially in urban areas, is insufficient for identifying a vehicle's lane. In this work, we develop a deep LSTM neural network model LaNet that determines the lane vehicles are on by periodically classifying accelerometer samples collected by vehicles as they drive in real time. Our key finding is that even adjacent patches of road surfaces contain characteristics that are sufficiently unique to differentiate between lanes, i.e., roads inherently exhibit differing bumps, cracks, potholes, and surface unevenness. Cars can capture this road surface information as they drive using inexpensive, easy-to-install accelerometers that increasingly come fitted in cars and can be accessed via the CAN-bus. We collect an aggregate of 60 km driving data and synthesize more based on this that capture factors such as variable driving speed, vehicle suspensions, and accelerometer noise. Our formulated LSTM-based deep learning model, LaNet, learns lane-specific sequences of road surface events (bumps, cracks etc.) and yields 100% lane classification accuracy with 200 meters of driving data, achieving over 90% with just 100 m (correspondingly to roughly one minute of driving). We design the LaNet model to be practical for use in real-time lane classification and show with extensive experiments that LaNet yields high classification accuracy even on smooth roads, on large multi-lane roads, and on drives with frequent lane changes. Since different road surfaces have different inherent characteristics or entropy, we excavate our neural network model and discover a mechanism to easily characterize the achievable classification accuracies in a road over various driving distances by training the model just once. We present LaNet as a low-cost, easily deployable and highly accurate way to achieve fine-grained lane identification.

- **Summary**: Akin to many subareas of computer vision, the recent advances in deep learning have also significantly influenced the literature on optical flow. Previously, the literature had been dominated by classical energy-based models, which formulate optical flow estimation as an energy minimization problem. However, as the practical benefits of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over conventional methods have become apparent in numerous areas of computer vision and beyond, they have also seen increased adoption in the context of motion estimation to the point where the current state of the art in terms of accuracy is set by CNN approaches. We first review this transition as well as the developments from early work to the current state of CNNs for optical flow estimation. Alongside, we discuss some of their technical details and compare them to recapitulate which technical contribution led to the most significant accuracy improvements. Then we provide an overview of the various optical flow approaches introduced in the deep learning age, including those based on alternative learning paradigms (e.g., unsupervised and semi-supervised methods) as well as the extension to the multi-frame case, which is able to yield further accuracy improvements.

- **Summary**: We develop a language-guided navigation task set in a continuous 3D environment where agents must execute low-level actions to follow natural language navigation directions. By being situated in continuous environments, this setting lifts a number of assumptions implicit in prior work that represents environments as a sparse graph of panoramas with edges corresponding to navigability. Specifically, our setting drops the presumptions of known environment topologies, short-range oracle navigation, and perfect agent localization. To contextualize this new task, we develop models that mirror many of the advances made in prior settings as well as single-modality baselines. While some of these techniques transfer, we find significantly lower absolute performance in the continuous setting -- suggesting that performance in prior `navigation-graph' settings may be inflated by the strong implicit assumptions.

- **Summary**: Saliency methods seek to explain the predictions of a model by producing an importance map across each input sample. A popular class of such methods is based on backpropagating a signal and analyzing the resulting gradient. Despite much research on such methods, relatively little work has been done to clarify the differences between such methods as well as the desiderata of these techniques. Thus, there is a need for rigorously understanding the relationships between different methods as well as their failure modes. In this work, we conduct a thorough analysis of backpropagation-based saliency methods and propose a single framework under which several such methods can be unified. As a result of our study, we make three additional contributions. First, we use our framework to propose NormGrad, a novel saliency method based on the spatial contribution of gradients of convolutional weights. Second, we combine saliency maps at different layers to test the ability of saliency methods to extract complementary information at different network levels (e.g.~trading off spatial resolution and distinctiveness) and we explain why some methods fail at specific layers (e.g., Grad-CAM anywhere besides the last convolutional layer). Third, we introduce a class-sensitivity metric and a meta-learning inspired paradigm applicable to any saliency method for improving sensitivity to the output class being explained.

- **Summary**: Spatially-adaptive normalization is remarkably successful recently in conditional semantic image synthesis, which modulates the normalized activation with spatially-varying transformations learned from semantic layouts, to preserve the semantic information from being washed away. Despite its impressive performance, a more thorough understanding of the true advantages inside the box is still highly demanded, to help reduce the significant computation and parameter overheads introduced by these new structures. In this paper, from a return-on-investment point of view, we present a deep analysis of the effectiveness of SPADE and observe that its advantages actually come mainly from its semantic-awareness rather than the spatial-adaptiveness. Inspired by this point, we propose class-adaptive normalization (CLADE), a lightweight variant that is not adaptive to spatial positions or layouts. Benefited from this design, CLADE greatly reduces the computation cost while still being able to preserve the semantic information during the generation. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets demonstrate that while the resulting fidelity is on par with SPADE, its overhead is much cheaper than SPADE. Take the generator for ADE20k dataset as an example, the extra parameter and computation cost introduced by CLADE are only 4.57% and 0.07% while that of SPADE are 39.21% and 234.73% respectively.

- **Summary**: We are seeing a Cambrian explosion of 3D shape representations for use in machine learning. Some representations seek high expressive power in capturing high-resolution detail. Other approaches seek to represent shapes as compositions of simple parts, which are intuitive for people to understand and easy to edit and manipulate. However, it is difficult to achieve both fidelity and interpretability in the same representation. We propose DualSDF, a representation expressing shapes at two levels of granularity, one capturing fine details and the other representing an abstracted proxy shape using simple and semantically consistent shape primitives. To achieve a tight coupling between the two representations, we use a variational objective over a shared latent space. Our two-level model gives rise to a new shape manipulation technique in which a user can interactively manipulate the coarse proxy shape and see the changes instantly mirrored in the high-resolution shape. Moreover, our model actively augments and guides the manipulation towards producing semantically meaningful shapes, making complex manipulations possible with minimal user input.

We store a low resolution version of an image as raw pixels, followed by several iterations of lossless super-resolution. For lossless super-resolution, we predict the probability of a high-resolution image, conditioned on the low-resolution input, and use entropy coding to compress this super-resolution operator. Super-Resolution based Compression (SReC) is able to achieve state-of-the-art compression rates with practical runtimes on large datasets.

- **Summary**: Chest radiography is a general method for diagnosing a patient's condition and identifying important information; therefore, radiography is used extensively in routine medical practice in various situations, such as emergency medical care and medical checkup. However, a high level of expertise is required to interpret chest radiographs. Thus, medical specialists spend considerable time in diagnosing such huge numbers of radiographs. In order to solve these problems, methods for generating findings have been proposed. However, the study of generating chest radiograph findings has primarily focused on the English language, and to the best of our knowledge, no studies have studied Japanese data on this subject. There are two challenges involved in generating findings in the Japanese language. The first challenge is that word splitting is difficult because the boundaries of Japanese word are not clear. The second challenge is that there are numerous orthographic variants. For deal with these two challenges, we proposed an end-to-end model that generates Japanese findings at the character-level from chest radiographs. In addition, we introduced the attention mechanism to improve not only the accuracy, but also the interpretation ability of the results. We evaluated the proposed method using a public dataset with Japanese findings. The effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed using the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy score. And, we were confirmed from the generated findings that the proposed method was able to consider the orthographic variants. Furthermore, we confirmed via visual inspection that the attention mechanism captures the features and positional information of radiographs.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the background-aware correlation filters have achie-ved a lot of research interest in the visual target tracking. However, these methods cannot suitably model the target appearance due to the exploitation of hand-crafted features. On the other hand, the recent deep learning-based visual tracking methods have provided a competitive performance along with extensive computations. In this paper, an adaptive background-aware correlation filter-based tracker is proposed that effectively models the target appearance by using either the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) or convolutional neural network (CNN) feature maps. The proposed method exploits the fast 2D non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm and the semantic information comparison to detect challenging situations. When the HOG-based response map is not reliable, or the context region has a low semantic similarity with prior regions, the proposed method constructs the CNN context model to improve the target region estimation. Furthermore, the rejection option allows the proposed method to update the CNN context model only on valid regions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive method clearly outperforms the accuracy and robustness of visual target tracking compared to the state-of-the-art methods on the OTB-50, OTB-100, TC-128, UAV-123, and VOT-2015 datasets.

- **Summary**: In recent years, visual tracking methods that are based on discriminative correlation filters (DCF) have been very promising. However, most of these methods suffer from a lack of robust scale estimation skills. Although a wide range of recent DCF-based methods exploit the features that are extracted from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their translation model, the scale of the visual target is still estimated by hand-crafted features. Whereas the exploitation of CNNs imposes a high computational burden, this paper exploits pre-trained lightweight CNNs models to propose two efficient scale estimation methods, which not only improve the visual tracking performance but also provide acceptable tracking speeds. The proposed methods are formulated based on either holistic or region representation of convolutional feature maps to efficiently integrate into DCF formulations to learn a robust scale model in the frequency domain. Moreover, against the conventional scale estimation methods with iterative feature extraction of different target regions, the proposed methods exploit proposed one-pass feature extraction processes that significantly improve the computational efficiency. Comprehensive experimental results on the OTB-50, OTB-100, TC-128 and VOT-2018 visual tracking datasets demonstrate that the proposed visual tracking methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods, effectively.

- **Summary**: The vulnerability of automated fingerprint recognition systems to presentation attacks (PA), i.e., spoof or altered fingers, has been a growing concern, warranting the development of accurate and efficient presentation attack detection (PAD) methods. However, one major limitation of the existing PAD solutions is their poor generalization to new PA materials and fingerprint sensors, not used in training. In this study, we propose a robust PAD solution with improved cross-material and cross-sensor generalization. Specifically, we build on top of any CNN-based architecture trained for fingerprint spoof detection combined with cross-material spoof generalization using a style transfer network wrapper. We also incorporate adversarial representation learning (ARL) in deep neural networks (DNN) to learn sensor and material invariant representations for PAD. Experimental results on LivDet 2015 and 2017 public domain datasets exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Few-shot semantic segmentation models aim to segment images after learning from only a few annotated examples. A key challenge for them is how to avoid overfitting because limited training data is available. While prior works usually limited the overall model capacity to alleviate overfitting, this hampers segmentation accuracy. We demonstrate how to increase overall model capacity to achieve improved performance, by introducing objectness, which is class-agnostic and so not prone to overfitting, for complementary use with class-specific features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the versatility of our simple approach of introducing objectness for different base architectures that rely on different data loaders and training schedules (DENet, PFENet) as well as with different backbone models (ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and HRNetV2-W48). Given only one annotated example of an unseen category, experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-art methods with respect to mIoU by at least 4.7% and 1.5% on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i respectively.

- **Summary**: Blind image deblurring remains a challenging problem for modern artificial neural networks. Unlike other image restoration problems, deblurring networks fail behind the performance of existing deblurring algorithms in case of uniform and 3D blur models. This follows from the diverse and profound effect that the unknown blur-kernel has on the deblurring operator.   We propose a new architecture which breaks the deblurring network into an analysis network which estimates the blur, and a synthesis network that uses this kernel to deblur the image. Unlike existing deblurring networks, this design allows us to explicitly incorporate the blur-kernel in the network's training. In addition, we introduce new cross-correlation layers that allow better blur estimations, as well as unique components that allow the estimate blur to control the action of the synthesis deblurring action.   Evaluating the new approach over established benchmark datasets shows its ability to achieve state-of-the-art deblurring accuracy on various tests, as well as offer a major speedup in runtime.

- **Summary**: Normalization layers and activation functions are fundamental components in deep networks and typically co-locate with each other. Here we propose to design them using an automated approach. Instead of designing them separately, we unify them into a single tensor-to-tensor computation graph, and evolve its structure starting from basic mathematical functions. Examples of such mathematical functions are addition, multiplication and statistical moments. The use of low-level mathematical functions, in contrast to the use of high-level modules in mainstream NAS, leads to a highly sparse and large search space which can be challenging for search methods. To address the challenge, we develop efficient rejection protocols to quickly filter out candidate layers that do not work well. We also use multi-objective evolution to optimize each layer's performance across many architectures to prevent overfitting. Our method leads to the discovery of EvoNorms, a set of new normalization-activation layers with novel, and sometimes surprising structures that go beyond existing design patterns. For example, some EvoNorms do not assume that normalization and activation functions must be applied sequentially, nor need to center the feature maps, nor require explicit activation functions. Our experiments show that EvoNorms work well on image classification models including ResNets, MobileNets and EfficientNets but also transfer well to Mask R-CNN with FPN/SpineNet for instance segmentation and to BigGAN for image synthesis, outperforming BatchNorm and GroupNorm based layers in many cases.

- **Summary**: Modern face alignment methods have become quite accurate at predicting the locations of facial landmarks, but they do not typically estimate the uncertainty of their predicted locations nor predict whether landmarks are visible. In this paper, we present a novel framework for jointly predicting landmark locations, associated uncertainties of these predicted locations, and landmark visibilities. We model these as mixed random variables and estimate them using a deep network trained with our proposed Location, Uncertainty, and Visibility Likelihood (LUVLi) loss. In addition, we release an entirely new labeling of a large face alignment dataset with over 19,000 face images in a full range of head poses. Each face is manually labeled with the ground-truth locations of 68 landmarks, with the additional information of whether each landmark is unoccluded, self-occluded (due to extreme head poses), or externally occluded. Not only does our joint estimation yield accurate estimates of the uncertainty of predicted landmark locations, but it also yields state-of-the-art estimates for the landmark locations themselves on multiple standard face alignment datasets. Our method's estimates of the uncertainty of predicted landmark locations could be used to automatically identify input images on which face alignment fails, which can be critical for downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: To leverage deep learning for image aesthetics assessment, one critical but unsolved issue is how to seamlessly incorporate the information of image aspect ratios to learn more robust models. In this paper, an adaptive fractional dilated convolution (AFDC), which is aspect-ratio-embedded, composition-preserving and parameter-free, is developed to tackle this issue natively in convolutional kernel level. Specifically, the fractional dilated kernel is adaptively constructed according to the image aspect ratios, where the interpolation of nearest two integers dilated kernels is used to cope with the misalignment of fractional sampling. Moreover, we provide a concise formulation for mini-batch training and utilize a grouping strategy to reduce computational overhead. As a result, it can be easily implemented by common deep learning libraries and plugged into popular CNN architectures in a computation-efficient manner. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image aesthetics assessment over the AVA dataset.

- **Summary**: Accurate crop type maps provide critical information for ensuring food security, yet there has been limited research on crop type classification for smallholder agriculture, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where risk of food insecurity is highest. Publicly-available ground-truth data such as the newly-released training dataset of crop types in Kenya (Radiant MLHub) are catalyzing this research, but it is important to understand the context of when, where, and how these datasets were obtained when evaluating classification performance and using them as a benchmark across methods. In this paper, we provide context for the new western Kenya dataset which was collected during an atypical 2019 main growing season and demonstrate classification accuracy up to 64% for maize and 70% for cassava using k Nearest Neighbors--a fast, interpretable, and scalable method that can serve as a baseline for future work.

- **Summary**: We present a generative model to synthesize 3D shapes as sets of handles -- lightweight proxies that approximate the original 3D shape -- for applications in interactive editing, shape parsing, and building compact 3D representations. Our model can generate handle sets with varying cardinality and different types of handles (Figure 1). Key to our approach is a deep architecture that predicts both the parameters and existence of shape handles, and a novel similarity measure that can easily accommodate different types of handles, such as cuboids or sphere-meshes. We leverage the recent advances in semantic 3D annotation as well as automatic shape summarizing techniques to supervise our approach. We show that the resulting shape representations are intuitive and achieve superior quality than previous state-of-the-art. Finally, we demonstrate how our method can be used in applications such as interactive shape editing, completion, and interpolation, leveraging the latent space learned by our model to guide these tasks.

- **Summary**: Medical imaging is the technique used to create images of the human body or parts of it for clinical purposes. Medical images always have large sizes and they are commonly corrupted by single or multiple noise type at the same time, due to various reasons, these two reasons are the triggers for moving toward parallel image processing to find alternatives of image de-noising techniques. This paper presents a parallel hybrid filter implementation for gray scale medical image de-noising. The hybridization is between adaptive median and wiener filters. Parallelization is implemented on the adaptive median filter to overcome the latency of neighborhood operation, parfor implicit parallelism powered by MatLab 2013a is used. The implementation is tested on an image of 2.5 MB size, which is divided into 2, 4 and 8 partitions; a comparison between the proposed implementation and sequential implementation is given, in terms of time. Thus, each case has the best time when assigned to number of threads equal to the number of its partitions. Moreover, Speed up and efficiency are calculated for the algorithm and they show a measured enhancement.



### Dense Steerable Filter CNNs for Exploiting Rotational Symmetry in Histology Images

- **Summary**: Histology images are inherently symmetric under rotation, where each orientation is equally as likely to appear. However, this rotational symmetry is not widely utilised as prior knowledge in modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), resulting in data hungry models that learn independent features at each orientation. Allowing CNNs to be rotation-equivariant removes the necessity to learn this set of transformations from the data and instead frees up model capacity, allowing more discriminative features to be learned. This reduction in the number of required parameters also reduces the risk of overfitting. In this paper, we propose Dense Steerable Filter CNNs (DSF-CNNs) that use group convolutions with multiple rotated copies of each filter in a densely connected framework. Each filter is defined as a linear combination of steerable basis filters, enabling exact rotation and decreasing the number of trainable parameters compared to standard filters. We also provide the first in-depth comparison of different rotation-equivariant CNNs for histology image analysis and demonstrate the advantage of encoding rotational symmetry into modern architectures. We show that DSF-CNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance, with significantly fewer parameters, when applied to three different tasks in the area of computational pathology: breast tumour classification, colon gland segmentation and multi-tissue nuclear segmentation.

- **Summary**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an emerging need for rapid, dedicated, and point-of-care COVID-19 patient disposition techniques to optimize resource utilization and clinical workflow. In view of this need, we present COVID-MobileXpert: a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) based mobile app that can use chest X-ray (CXR) for COVID-19 case screening and radiological trajectory prediction. We design and implement a novel three-player knowledge transfer and distillation (KTD) framework including a pre-trained attending physician (AP) network that extracts CXR imaging features from a large scale of lung disease CXR images, a fine-tuned resident fellow (RF) network that learns the essential CXR imaging features to discriminate COVID-19 from pneumonia and/or normal cases with a small amount of COVID-19 cases, and a trained lightweight medical student (MS) network to perform on-device COVID-19 patient triage and follow-up. To tackle the challenge of vastly similar and dominant fore- and background in medical images, we employ novel loss functions and training schemes for the MS network to learn the robust features. We demonstrate the significant potential of COVID-MobileXpert for rapid deployment via extensive experiments with diverse MS architecture and tuning parameter settings.

- **Summary**: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been extensively studied. However, research on egocentric traffic videos with dynamic scenes lacks large-scale benchmark datasets as well as effective evaluation metrics. This paper proposes traffic anomaly detection with a \textit{when-where-what} pipeline to detect, localize, and recognize anomalous events from egocentric videos. We introduce a new dataset called Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) containing 4,677 videos with temporal, spatial, and categorical annotations. A new spatial-temporal area under curve (STAUC) evaluation metric is proposed and used with DoTA. State-of-the-art methods are benchmarked for two VAD-related tasks.Experimental results show STAUC is an effective VAD metric. To our knowledge, DoTA is the largest traffic anomaly dataset to-date and is the first supporting traffic anomaly studies across when-where-what perspectives. Our code and dataset can be found in: https://github.com/MoonBlvd/Detection-of-Traffic-Anomaly
