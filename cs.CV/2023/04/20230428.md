- **Summary**: Although purely transformer-based architectures showed promising performance in many computer vision tasks, many hybrid models consisting of CNN and transformer blocks are introduced to fit more specialized tasks. Nevertheless, despite the performance gain of both pure and hybrid transformer-based architectures compared to CNNs in medical imaging segmentation, their high training cost and complexity make it challenging to use them in real scenarios. In this work, we propose simple architectures based on purely convolutional layers, and show that by just taking advantage of the attention map visualizations obtained from a self-supervised pretrained vision transformer network (e.g., DINO) one can outperform complex transformer-based networks with much less computation costs. The proposed architecture is composed of two encoder branches with the original image as input in one branch and the attention map visualizations of the same image from multiple self-attention heads from a pre-trained DINO model (as multiple channels) in the other branch. The results of our experiments on two publicly available medical imaging datasets show that the proposed pipeline outperforms U-Net and the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models.

- **Summary**: Although the preservation of shape continuity and physiological anatomy is a natural assumption in the segmentation of medical images, it is often neglected by deep learning methods that mostly aim for the statistical modeling of input data as pixels rather than interconnected structures. In biological structures, however, organs are not separate entities; for example, in reality, a severed vessel is an indication of an underlying problem, but traditional segmentation models are not designed to strictly enforce the continuity of anatomy, potentially leading to inaccurate medical diagnoses. To address this issue, we propose a graph-based approach that enforces the continuity and connectivity of anatomical topology in medical images. Our method encodes the continuity of shapes as a graph constraint, ensuring that the network's predictions maintain this continuity. We evaluate our method on two public benchmarks on retinal vessel segmentation, showing significant improvements in connectivity metrics compared to traditional methods while getting better or on-par performance on segmentation metrics.

- **Summary**: Text-conditioned image generation has made significant progress in recent years with generative adversarial networks and more recently, diffusion models. While diffusion models conditioned on text prompts have produced impressive and high-quality images, accurately representing complex text prompts such as the number of instances of a specific object remains challenging.   To address this limitation, we propose a novel guidance approach for the sampling process in the diffusion model that leverages bounding box and segmentation map information at inference time without additional training data. Through a novel loss in the sampling process, our approach guides the model with semantic features from CLIP embeddings and enforces geometric constraints, leading to high-resolution images that accurately represent the scene. To obtain bounding box and segmentation map information, we structure the text prompt as a scene graph and enrich the nodes with CLIP embeddings. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks for image generation from scene graphs, surpassing both scene graph to image and text-based diffusion models in various metrics. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating bounding box and segmentation map guidance in the diffusion model sampling process for more accurate text-to-image generation.

- **Summary**: Objective technical skill assessment is crucial for effective training of new surgeons in robot-assisted surgery. With advancements in surgical training programs in both physical and virtual environments, it is imperative to develop generalizable methods for automatically assessing skills. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for skill assessment by transferring domain knowledge from labeled kinematic data to unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled data from common surgical training tasks such as Suturing, Needle Passing, and Knot Tying to jointly train a model with both labeled and unlabeled data. Pseudo labels are generated for the unlabeled data through an iterative manner that incorporates uncertainty estimation to ensure accurate labeling. We evaluate our method on a virtual reality simulated training task (Ring Transfer) using data from the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). The results show that trainees with robotic assistance have significantly higher expert probability compared to these without any assistance, p < 0.05, which aligns with previous studies showing the benefits of robotic assistance in improving training proficiency. Our method offers a significant advantage over other existing works as it does not require manual labeling or prior knowledge of the surgical training task for robot-assisted surgery.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we explore a novel model reusing task tailored for graph neural networks (GNNs), termed as "deep graph reprogramming". We strive to reprogram a pre-trained GNN, without amending raw node features nor model parameters, to handle a bunch of cross-level downstream tasks in various domains. To this end, we propose an innovative Data Reprogramming paradigm alongside a Model Reprogramming paradigm. The former one aims to address the challenge of diversified graph feature dimensions for various tasks on the input side, while the latter alleviates the dilemma of fixed per-task-per-model behavior on the model side. For data reprogramming, we specifically devise an elaborated Meta-FeatPadding method to deal with heterogeneous input dimensions, and also develop a transductive Edge-Slimming as well as an inductive Meta-GraPadding approach for diverse homogenous samples. Meanwhile, for model reprogramming, we propose a novel task-adaptive Reprogrammable-Aggregator, to endow the frozen model with larger expressive capacities in handling cross-domain tasks. Experiments on fourteen datasets across node/graph classification/regression, 3D object recognition, and distributed action recognition, demonstrate that the proposed methods yield gratifying results, on par with those by re-training from scratch.

- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critically important for brain mapping in both scientific research and clinical studies. Precise segmentation of brain tumors facilitates clinical diagnosis, evaluations, and surgical planning. Deep learning has recently emerged to improve brain tumor segmentation and achieved impressive results. Convolutional architectures are widely used to implement those neural networks. By the nature of limited receptive fields, however, those architectures are subject to representing long-range spatial dependencies of the voxel intensities in MRI images. Transformers have been leveraged recently to address the above limitations of convolutional networks. Unfortunately, the majority of current Transformers-based methods in segmentation are performed with 2D MRI slices, instead of 3D volumes. Moreover, it is difficult to incorporate the structures between layers because each head is calculated independently in the Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism (MHSA). In this work, we proposed a 3D Transformer-based segmentation approach. We developed a Fusion-Head Self-Attention mechanism (FHSA) to combine each attention head through attention logic and weight mapping, for the exploration of the long-range spatial dependencies in 3D MRI images. We implemented a plug-and-play self-attention module, named the Infinite Deformable Fusion Transformer Module (IDFTM), to extract features on any deformable feature maps. We applied our approach to the task of brain tumor segmentation, and assessed it on the public BRATS datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed approach achieved superior performance, in comparison to several state-of-the-art segmentation methods.



### Improve Video Representation with Temporal Adversarial Augmentation

- **Summary**: Recent works reveal that adversarial augmentation benefits the generalization of neural networks (NNs) if used in an appropriate manner. In this paper, we introduce Temporal Adversarial Augmentation (TA), a novel video augmentation technique that utilizes temporal attention. Unlike conventional adversarial augmentation, TA is specifically designed to shift the attention distributions of neural networks with respect to video clips by maximizing a temporal-related loss function. We demonstrate that TA will obtain diverse temporal views, which significantly affect the focus of neural networks. Training with these examples remedies the flaw of unbalanced temporal information perception and enhances the ability to defend against temporal shifts, ultimately leading to better generalization. To leverage TA, we propose Temporal Video Adversarial Fine-tuning (TAF) framework for improving video representations. TAF is a model-agnostic, generic, and interpretability-friendly training strategy. We evaluate TAF with four powerful models (TSM, GST, TAM, and TPN) over three challenging temporal-related benchmarks (Something-something V1&V2 and diving48). Experimental results demonstrate that TAF effectively improves the test accuracy of these models with notable margins without introducing additional parameters or computational costs. As a byproduct, TAF also improves the robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. Code is available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/TAF.

- **Summary**: Orbit recovery problems are a class of problems that often arise in practice and in various forms. In these problems, we aim to estimate an unknown function after being distorted by a group action and observed via a known operator. Typically, the observations are contaminated with a non-trivial level of noise. Two particular orbit recovery problems of interest in this paper are multireference alignment and single-particle cryo-EM modeling. In order to suppress the noise, we suggest using the method of moments approach for both problems while introducing deep neural network priors. In particular, our neural networks should output the signals and the distribution of group elements, with moments being the input. In the multireference alignment case, we demonstrate the advantage of using the NN to accelerate the convergence for the reconstruction of signals from the moments. Finally, we use our method to reconstruct simulated and biological volumes in the cryo-EM setting.

- **Summary**: Evaluating the performance of low-light image enhancement (LLE) is highly subjective, thus making integrating human preferences into image enhancement a necessity. Existing methods fail to consider this and present a series of potentially valid heuristic criteria for training enhancement models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, i.e., aesthetics-guided low-light image enhancement (ALL-E), which introduces aesthetic preferences to LLE and motivates training in a reinforcement learning framework with an aesthetic reward. Each pixel, functioning as an agent, refines itself by recursive actions, i.e., its corresponding adjustment curve is estimated sequentially. Extensive experiments show that integrating aesthetic assessment improves both subjective experience and objective evaluation. Our results on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of ALL-E over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Pan-sharpening aims to increase the spatial resolution of the low-resolution multispectral (LrMS) image with the guidance of the corresponding panchromatic (PAN) image. Although deep learning (DL)-based pan-sharpening methods have achieved promising performance, most of them have a two-fold deficiency. For one thing, the universally adopted black box principle limits the model interpretability. For another thing, existing DL-based methods fail to efficiently capture local and global dependencies at the same time, inevitably limiting the overall performance. To address these mentioned issues, we first formulate the degradation process of the high-resolution multispectral (HrMS) image as a unified variational optimization problem, and alternately solve its data and prior subproblems by the designed iterative proximal gradient descent (PGD) algorithm. Moreover, we customize a Local-Global Transformer (LGT) to simultaneously model local and global dependencies, and further formulate an LGT-based prior module for image denoising. Besides the prior module, we also design a lightweight data module. Finally, by serially integrating the data and prior modules in each iterative stage, we unfold the iterative algorithm into a stage-wise unfolding network, Local-Global Transformer Enhanced Unfolding Network (LGTEUN), for the interpretable MS pan-sharpening. Comprehensive experimental results on three satellite data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LGTEUN compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

- **Summary**: Multi-sensor fusion (MSF) is widely adopted for perception in autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly for the task of 3D object detection with camera and LiDAR sensors. The rationale behind fusion is to capitalize on the strengths of each modality while mitigating their limitations. The exceptional and leading performance of fusion models has been demonstrated by advanced deep neural network (DNN)-based fusion techniques. Fusion models are also perceived as more robust to attacks compared to single-modal ones due to the redundant information in multiple modalities. In this work, we challenge this perspective with single-modal attacks that targets the camera modality, which is considered less significant in fusion but more affordable for attackers. We argue that the weakest link of fusion models depends on their most vulnerable modality, and propose an attack framework that targets advanced camera-LiDAR fusion models with adversarial patches. Our approach employs a two-stage optimization-based strategy that first comprehensively assesses vulnerable image areas under adversarial attacks, and then applies customized attack strategies to different fusion models, generating deployable patches. Evaluations with five state-of-the-art camera-LiDAR fusion models on a real-world dataset show that our attacks successfully compromise all models. Our approach can either reduce the mean average precision (mAP) of detection performance from 0.824 to 0.353 or degrade the detection score of the target object from 0.727 to 0.151 on average, demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed attack framework.

- **Summary**: The majority of current salient object detection (SOD) models are focused on designing a series of decoders based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) or Transformer architectures and integrating them in a skillful manner. These models have achieved remarkable high performance and made significant contributions to the development of SOD. Their primary research objective is to develop novel algorithms that can outperform state-of-the-art models, a task that is extremely difficult and time-consuming. In contrast, this paper proposes a positive feedback method based on F-measure value for SOD, aiming to improve the accuracy of saliency prediction using existing methods. Specifically, our proposed method takes an image to be detected and inputs it into several existing models to obtain their respective prediction maps. These prediction maps are then fed into our positive feedback method to generate the final prediction result, without the need for careful decoder design or model training. Moreover, our method is adaptive and can be implemented based on existing models without any restrictions. Experimental results on five publicly available datasets show that our proposed positive feedback method outperforms the latest 12 methods in five evaluation metrics for saliency map prediction. Additionally, we conducted a robustness experiment, which shows that when at least one good prediction result exists in the selected existing model, our proposed approach can ensure that the prediction result is not worse. Our approach achieves a prediction speed of 20 frames per second (FPS) when evaluated on a low configuration host and after removing the prediction time overhead of inserted models. These results highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our proposed approach for salient object detection.

- **Summary**: Automated image captioning has the potential to be a useful tool for people with vision impairments. Images taken by this user group are often noisy, which leads to incorrect and even unsafe model predictions. In this paper, we propose a quality-agnostic framework to improve the performance and robustness of image captioning models for visually impaired people. We address this problem from three angles: data, model, and evaluation. First, we show how data augmentation techniques for generating synthetic noise can address data sparsity in this domain. Second, we enhance the robustness of the model by expanding a state-of-the-art model to a dual network architecture, using the augmented data and leveraging different consistency losses. Our results demonstrate increased performance, e.g. an absolute improvement of 2.15 on CIDEr, compared to state-of-the-art image captioning networks, as well as increased robustness to noise with up to 3 points improvement on CIDEr in more noisy settings. Finally, we evaluate the prediction reliability using confidence calibration on images with different difficulty/noise levels, showing that our models perform more reliably in safety-critical situations. The improved model is part of an assisted living application, which we develop in partnership with the Royal National Institute of Blind People.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we trialled different methods of data preparation for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training and semantic segmentation of land use land cover (LULC) features within aerial photography over the Wet Tropics and Atherton Tablelands, Queensland, Australia. This was conducted through trialling and ranking various training patch selection sampling strategies, patch and batch sizes and data augmentations and scaling. We also compared model accuracy through producing the LULC classification using a single pass of a grid of patches and averaging multiple grid passes and three rotated version of each patch. Our results showed: a stratified random sampling approach for producing training patches improved the accuracy of classes with a smaller area while having minimal effect on larger classes; a smaller number of larger patches compared to a larger number of smaller patches improves model accuracy; applying data augmentations and scaling are imperative in creating a generalised model able to accurately classify LULC features in imagery from a different date and sensor; and producing the output classification by averaging multiple grids of patches and three rotated versions of each patch produced and more accurate and aesthetic result. Combining the findings from the trials, we fully trained five models on the 2018 training image and applied the model to the 2015 test image with the output LULC classifications achieving an average kappa of 0.84 user accuracy of 0.81 and producer accuracy of 0.87. This study has demonstrated the importance of data pre-processing for developing a generalised deep-learning model for LULC classification which can be applied to a different date and sensor. Future research using CNN and earth observation data should implement the findings of this study to increase LULC model accuracy and transferability.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in neural reconstruction using posed image sequences have made remarkable progress. However, due to the lack of depth information, existing volumetric-based techniques simply duplicate 2D image features of the object surface along the entire camera ray. We contend this duplication introduces noise in empty and occluded spaces, posing challenges for producing high-quality 3D geometry. Drawing inspiration from traditional multi-view stereo methods, we propose an end-to-end 3D neural reconstruction framework CVRecon, designed to exploit the rich geometric embedding in the cost volumes to facilitate 3D geometric feature learning. Furthermore, we present Ray-contextual Compensated Cost Volume (RCCV), a novel 3D geometric feature representation that encodes view-dependent information with improved integrity and robustness. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the reconstruction quality in various metrics and recovers clear fine details of the 3D geometries. Our extensive ablation studies provide insights into the development of effective 3D geometric feature learning schemes. Project page: https://cvrecon.ziyue.cool/

- **Summary**: Live video commenting is popular on video media platforms, as it can create a chatting atmosphere and provide supplementary information for users while watching videos. Automatically generating live video comments can improve user experience and enable human-like generation for bot chatting. Existing works mostly focus on short video datasets while ignoring other important video types such as long videos like movies. In this work, we collect a new Movie Live Comments (MovieLC) dataset to support research on live video comment generation for long videos. We also propose a knowledge enhanced generation model inspired by the divergent and informative nature of live video comments. Our model adopts a pre-training encoder-decoder framework and incorporates external knowledge. Extensive experiments show that both objective metrics and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. The MovieLC dataset and our code will be released.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is the first foundation model for general image segmentation. It designed a novel promotable segmentation task, ensuring zero-shot image segmentation using the pre-trained model via two main modes including automatic everything and manual prompt. SAM has achieved impressive results on various natural image segmentation tasks. However, medical image segmentation (MIS) is more challenging due to the complex modalities, fine anatomical structures, uncertain and complex object boundaries, and wide-range object scales. Meanwhile, zero-shot and efficient MIS can well reduce the annotation time and boost the development of medical image analysis. Hence, SAM seems to be a potential tool and its performance on large medical datasets should be further validated. We collected and sorted 52 open-source datasets, and built a large medical segmentation dataset with 16 modalities, 68 objects, and 553K slices. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of different SAM testing strategies on the so-called COSMOS 553K dataset. Extensive experiments validate that SAM performs better with manual hints like points and boxes for object perception in medical images, leading to better performance in prompt mode compared to everything mode. Additionally, SAM shows remarkable performance in some specific objects and modalities, but is imperfect or even totally fails in other situations. Finally, we analyze the influence of different factors (e.g., the Fourier-based boundary complexity and size of the segmented objects) on SAM's segmentation performance. Extensive experiments validate that SAM's zero-shot segmentation capability is not sufficient to ensure its direct application to the MIS.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of videos collected during in-the-wild natural settings has pushed the development of effective Video Quality Assessment (VQA) methodologies. Contemporary supervised opinion-driven VQA strategies predominantly hinge on training from expensive human annotations for quality scores, which limited the scale and distribution of VQA datasets and consequently led to unsatisfactory generalization capacity of methods driven by these data. On the other hand, although several handcrafted zero-shot quality indices do not require training from human opinions, they are unable to account for the semantics of videos, rendering them ineffective in comprehending complex authentic distortions (e.g., white balance, exposure) and assessing the quality of semantic content within videos. To address these challenges, we introduce the text-prompted Semantic Affinity Quality Index (SAQI) and its localized version (SAQI-Local) using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to ascertain the affinity between textual prompts and visual features, facilitating a comprehensive examination of semantic quality concerns without the reliance on human quality annotations. By amalgamating SAQI with existing low-level metrics, we propose the unified Blind Video Quality Index (BVQI) and its improved version, BVQI-Local, which demonstrates unprecedented performance, surpassing existing zero-shot indices by at least 24\% on all datasets. Moreover, we devise an efficient fine-tuning scheme for BVQI-Local that jointly optimizes text prompts and final fusion weights, resulting in state-of-the-art performance and superior generalization ability in comparison to prevalent opinion-driven VQA methods. We conduct comprehensive analyses to investigate different quality concerns of distinct indices, demonstrating the effectiveness and rationality of our design.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundation model for semantic segmentation and shows excellent generalization capability with the prompts. In this empirical study, we investigate the robustness and zero-shot generalizability of the SAM in the domain of robotic surgery in various settings of (i) prompted vs. unprompted; (ii) bounding box vs. points-based prompt; (iii) generalization under corruptions and perturbations with five severity levels; and (iv) state-of-the-art supervised model vs. SAM. We conduct all the observations with two well-known robotic instrument segmentation datasets of MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and 2018 challenges. Our extensive evaluation results reveal that although SAM shows remarkable zero-shot generalization ability with bounding box prompts, it struggles to segment the whole instrument with point-based prompts and unprompted settings. Furthermore, our qualitative figures demonstrate that the model either failed to predict the parts of the instrument mask (e.g., jaws, wrist) or predicted parts of the instrument as different classes in the scenario of overlapping instruments within the same bounding box or with the point-based prompt. In fact, it is unable to identify instruments in some complex surgical scenarios of blood, reflection, blur, and shade. Additionally, SAM is insufficiently robust to maintain high performance when subjected to various forms of data corruption. Therefore, we can argue that SAM is not ready for downstream surgical tasks without further domain-specific fine-tuning.

- **Summary**: People with vocal and hearing disabilities use sign language to express themselves using visual gestures and signs. Although sign language is a solution for communication difficulties faced by deaf people, there are still problems as most of the general population cannot understand this language, creating a communication barrier, especially in places such as banks, airports, supermarkets, etc. [1]. A sign language recognition(SLR) system is a must to solve this problem. The main focus of this model is to develop a real-time word-level sign language recognition system that would translate sign language to text. Much research has been done on ASL(American sign language). Thus, we have worked on ISL(Indian sign language) to cater to the needs of the deaf and hard-of-hearing community of India[2]. In this research, we provide an Indian Sign Language-based Sign Language recognition system. For this analysis, the user must be able to take pictures of hand movements using a web camera, and the system must anticipate and display the name of the taken picture. The acquired image goes through several processing phases, some of which use computer vision techniques, including grayscale conversion, dilatation, and masking. Our model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is then utilized to recognize the images. Our best model has a 99% accuracy rate[3].

- **Summary**: In the field of affective computing, researchers in the community have promoted the performance of models and algorithms by using the complementarity of multimodal information. However, the emergence of more and more modal information makes the development of datasets unable to keep up with the progress of existing modal sensing equipment. Collecting and studying multimodal data is a complex and significant work. In order to supplement the challenge of partial missing of community data. We collected and labeled a new homogeneous multimodal gesture emotion recognition dataset based on the analysis of the existing data sets. This data set complements the defects of homogeneous multimodal data and provides a new research direction for emotion recognition. Moreover, we propose a pseudo dual-flow network based on this dataset, and verify the application potential of this dataset in the affective computing community. The experimental results demonstrate that it is feasible to use the traditional visual information and spiking visual information based on homogeneous multimodal data for visual emotion recognition.The dataset is available at \url{https://github.com/201528014227051/SGED}

- **Summary**: The success of deep learning is frequently described as the ability to train all parameters of a network on a specific application in an end-to-end fashion. Yet, several design choices on the camera level, including the pixel layout of the sensor, are considered as pre-defined and fixed, and high resolution, regular pixel layouts are considered to be the most generic ones in computer vision and graphics, treating all regions of an image as equally important. While several works have considered non-uniform, \eg, hexagonal or foveated, pixel layouts in hardware and image processing, the layout has not been integrated into the end-to-end learning paradigm so far. In this work, we present the first truly end-to-end trained imaging pipeline that optimizes the size and distribution of pixels on the imaging sensor jointly with the parameters of a given neural network on a specific task. We derive an analytic, differentiable approach for the sensor layout parameterization that allows for task-specific, local varying pixel resolutions. We present two pixel layout parameterization functions: rectangular and curvilinear grid shapes that retain a regular topology. We provide a drop-in module that approximates sensor simulation given existing high-resolution images to directly connect our method with existing deep learning models. We show that network predictions benefit from learnable pixel layouts for two different downstream tasks, classification and semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Self-training based semi-supervised learning algorithms have enabled the learning of highly accurate deep neural networks, using only a fraction of labeled data. However, the majority of work on self-training has focused on the objective of improving accuracy, whereas practical machine learning systems can have complex goals (e.g. maximizing the minimum of recall across classes, etc.) that are non-decomposable in nature. In this work, we introduce the Cost-Sensitive Self-Training (CSST) framework which generalizes the self-training-based methods for optimizing non-decomposable metrics. We prove that our framework can better optimize the desired non-decomposable metric utilizing unlabeled data, under similar data distribution assumptions made for the analysis of self-training. Using the proposed CSST framework, we obtain practical self-training methods (for both vision and NLP tasks) for optimizing different non-decomposable metrics using deep neural networks. Our results demonstrate that CSST achieves an improvement over the state-of-the-art in majority of the cases across datasets and objectives.

- **Summary**: Losing pets can be highly distressing for pet owners, and finding a lost pet is often challenging and time-consuming. An artificial intelligence-based application can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of finding lost pets. In order to facilitate such an application, this study introduces a contrastive neural network model capable of accurately distinguishing between images of pets. The model was trained on a large dataset of dog images and evaluated through 3-fold cross-validation. Following 350 epochs of training, the model achieved a test accuracy of 90%. Furthermore, overfitting was avoided, as the test accuracy closely matched the training accuracy. Our findings suggest that contrastive neural network models hold promise as a tool for locating lost pets. This paper provides the foundation for a potential web application that allows users to upload images of their missing pets, receiving notifications when matching images are found in the application's image database. This would enable pet owners to quickly and accurately locate lost pets and reunite them with their families.

- **Summary**: The growing availability of digitized art collections has created the need to manage, analyze and categorize large amounts of data related to abstract concepts, highlighting a demanding problem of computer science and leading to new research perspectives. Advances in artificial intelligence and neural networks provide the right tools for this challenge. The analysis of artworks to extract features useful in certain works is at the heart of the era. In the present work, we approach the problem of painter recognition in a set of digitized paintings, derived from the WikiArt repository, using transfer learning to extract the appropriate features and classical machine learning methods to evaluate the result. Through the testing of various models and their fine tuning we came to the conclusion that RegNet performs better in exporting features, while SVM makes the best classification of images based on the painter with a performance of up to 85%. Also, we introduced a new large dataset for painting recognition task including 62 artists achieving good results.

- **Summary**: Preoperative radiological identification of mandibular canals is essential for maxillofacial surgery. This study demonstrates the reproducibility of a deep learning system (DLS) by evaluating its localisation performance on 165 heterogeneous cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans from 72 patients in comparison to an experienced radiologist's annotations. We evaluated the performance of the DLS using the symmetric mean curve distance (SMCD), the average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The reproducibility of the SMCD was assessed using the within-subject coefficient of repeatability (RC). Three other experts rated the diagnostic validity twice using a 0-4 Likert scale. The reproducibility of the Likert scoring was assessed using the repeatability measure (RM). The RC of SMCD was 0.969 mm, the median (interquartile range) SMCD and ASSD were 0.643 (0.186) mm and 0.351 (0.135) mm, respectively, and the mean (standard deviation) DSC was 0.548 (0.138). The DLS performance was most affected by postoperative changes. The RM of the Likert scoring was 0.923 for the radiologist and 0.877 for the DLS. The mean (standard deviation) Likert score was 3.94 (0.27) for the radiologist and 3.84 (0.65) for the DLS. The DLS demonstrated proficient qualitative and quantitative reproducibility, temporal generalisability, and clinical validity.

- **Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a state-of-the-art, non-contact methodology for estimating human pulse by analyzing facial videos. Despite its potential, rPPG methods can be susceptible to various artifacts, such as noise, occlusions, and other obstructions caused by sunglasses, masks, or even involuntary facial contact, such as individuals inadvertently touching their faces. In this study, we apply image processing transformations to intentionally degrade video quality, mimicking these challenging conditions, and subsequently evaluate the performance of both non-learning and learning-based rPPG methods on the deteriorated data. Our results reveal a significant decrease in accuracy in the presence of these artifacts, prompting us to propose the application of restoration techniques, such as denoising and inpainting, to improve heart-rate estimation outcomes. By addressing these challenging conditions and occlusion artifacts, our approach aims to make rPPG methods more robust and adaptable to real-world situations. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we undertake comprehensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, encompassing a wide range of scenarios and artifact types. Our findings underscore the potential to construct a robust rPPG system by employing an optimal combination of restoration algorithms and rPPG techniques. Moreover, our study contributes to the advancement of privacy-conscious rPPG methodologies, thereby bolstering the overall utility and impact of this innovative technology in the field of remote heart-rate estimation under realistic and diverse conditions.

- **Summary**: As a promising non-password authentication technology, radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting can greatly improve wireless security. Recent work has shown that RF fingerprinting based on deep learning can significantly outperform conventional approaches. The superiority, however, is mainly attributed to supervised learning using a large amount of labeled data, and it significantly degrades if only limited labeled data is available, making many existing algorithms lack practicability. Considering that it is often easier to obtain enough unlabeled data in practice with minimal resources, we leverage deep semi-supervised learning for RF fingerprinting, which largely relies on a composite data augmentation scheme designed for radio signals, combined with two popular techniques: consistency-based regularization and pseudo-labeling. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method for semi-supervised RF fingerprinting is far superior to other competing ones, and it can achieve remarkable performance almost close to that of fully supervised learning with a very limited number of examples.

- **Summary**: 3D point cloud semantic segmentation is one of the fundamental tasks for environmental understanding. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, the performance of classes with few examples or few points is still far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-to-single knowledge distillation framework for the 3D point cloud semantic segmentation task to boost the performance of those hard classes. Instead of fusing all the points of multi-scans directly, only the instances that belong to the previously defined hard classes are fused. To effectively and sufficiently distill valuable knowledge from multi-scans, we leverage a multilevel distillation framework, i.e., feature representation distillation, logit distillation, and affinity distillation. We further develop a novel instance-aware affinity distillation algorithm for capturing high-level structural knowledge to enhance the distillation efficacy for hard classes. Finally, we conduct experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset, and the results on both the validation and test sets demonstrate that our method yields substantial improvements compared with the baseline method.

- **Summary**: For patients suffering from central nervous system tumors, prognosis estimation, treatment decisions, and postoperative assessments are made from the analysis of a set of magnetic resonance (MR) scans. Currently, the lack of open tools for standardized and automatic tumor segmentation and generation of clinical reports, incorporating relevant tumor characteristics, leads to potential risks from inherent decisions' subjectivity. To tackle this problem, the proposed Raidionics open-source software has been developed, offering both a user-friendly graphical user interface and stable processing backend. The software includes preoperative segmentation models for each of the most common tumor types (i.e., glioblastomas, lower grade gliomas, meningiomas, and metastases), together with one early postoperative glioblastoma segmentation model. Preoperative segmentation performances were quite homogeneous across the four different brain tumor types, with an average Dice around 85% and patient-wise recall and precision around 95%. Postoperatively, performances were lower with an average Dice of 41%. Overall, the generation of a standardized clinical report, including the tumor segmentation and features computation, requires about ten minutes on a regular laptop. The proposed Raidionics software is the first open solution enabling an easy use of state-of-the-art segmentation models for all major tumor types, including preoperative and postsurgical standardized reports.

- **Summary**: Labeling LiDAR point clouds for training autonomous driving is extremely expensive and difficult. LiDAR simulation aims at generating realistic LiDAR data with labels for training and verifying self-driving algorithms more efficiently. Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been proposed for novel view synthesis using implicit reconstruction of 3D scenes. Inspired by this, we present NeRF-LIDAR, a novel LiDAR simulation method that leverages real-world information to generate realistic LIDAR point clouds. Different from existing LiDAR simulators, we use real images and point cloud data collected by self-driving cars to learn the 3D scene representation, point cloud generation and label rendering. We verify the effectiveness of our NeRF-LiDAR by training different 3D segmentation models on the generated LiDAR point clouds. It reveals that the trained models are able to achieve similar accuracy when compared with the same model trained on the real LiDAR data. Besides, the generated data is capable of boosting the accuracy through pre-training which helps reduce the requirements of the real labeled data.

- **Summary**: Previous methods solve feature matching and pose estimation using a two-stage process by first finding matches and then estimating the pose. As they ignore the geometric relationships between the two tasks, they focus on either improving the quality of matches or filtering potential outliers, leading to limited efficiency or accuracy. In contrast, we propose an iterative matching and pose estimation framework (IMP) leveraging the geometric connections between the two tasks: a few good matches are enough for a roughly accurate pose estimation; a roughly accurate pose can be used to guide the matching by providing geometric constraints. To this end, we implement a geometry-aware recurrent attention-based module which jointly outputs sparse matches and camera poses. Specifically, for each iteration, we first implicitly embed geometric information into the module via a pose-consistency loss, allowing it to predict geometry-aware matches progressively. Second, we introduce an \textbf{e}fficient IMP, called EIMP, to dynamically discard keypoints without potential matches, avoiding redundant updating and significantly reducing the quadratic time complexity of attention computation in transformers. Experiments on YFCC100m, Scannet, and Aachen Day-Night datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: 3D shape reconstruction typically requires identifying object features or textures in multiple images of a subject. This approach is not viable when the subject is semi-transparent and moving in and out of focus. Here we overcome these challenges by rendering a candidate shape with adaptive blurring and transparency for comparison with the images. We use the microscopic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a case study as it freely explores a 3D complex fluid with constantly changing optical properties. We model the slender worm as a 3D curve using an intrinsic parametrisation that naturally admits biologically-informed constraints and regularisation. To account for the changing optics we develop a novel differentiable renderer to construct images from 2D projections and compare against raw images to generate a pixel-wise error to jointly update the curve, camera and renderer parameters using gradient descent. The method is robust to interference such as bubbles and dirt trapped in the fluid, stays consistent through complex sequences of postures, recovers reliable estimates from blurry images and provides a significant improvement on previous attempts to track C. elegans in 3D. Our results demonstrate the potential of direct approaches to shape estimation in complex physical environments in the absence of ground-truth data.

- **Summary**: Visual localization is a fundamental task for various applications including autonomous driving and robotics. Prior methods focus on extracting large amounts of often redundant locally reliable features, resulting in limited efficiency and accuracy, especially in large-scale environments under challenging conditions. Instead, we propose to extract globally reliable features by implicitly embedding high-level semantics into both the detection and description processes. Specifically, our semantic-aware detector is able to detect keypoints from reliable regions (e.g. building, traffic lane) and suppress unreliable areas (e.g. sky, car) implicitly instead of relying on explicit semantic labels. This boosts the accuracy of keypoint matching by reducing the number of features sensitive to appearance changes and avoiding the need of additional segmentation networks at test time. Moreover, our descriptors are augmented with semantics and have stronger discriminative ability, providing more inliers at test time. Particularly, experiments on long-term large-scale visual localization Aachen Day-Night and RobotCar-Seasons datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms previous local features and gives competitive accuracy to advanced matchers but is about 2 and 3 times faster when using 2k and 4k keypoints, respectively.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a computational framework for the concise encoding of an ensemble of persistence diagrams, in the form of weighted Wasserstein barycenters [99], [101] of a dictionary of atom diagrams. We introduce a multi-scale gradient descent approach for the efficient resolution of the corresponding minimization problem, which interleaves the optimization of the barycenter weights with the optimization of the atom diagrams. Our approach leverages the analytic expressions for the gradient of both sub-problems to ensure fast iterations and it additionally exploits shared-memory parallelism. Extensive experiments on public ensembles demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, with Wasserstein dictionary computations in the orders of minutes for the largest examples. We show the utility of our contributions in two applications. First, we apply Wassserstein dictionaries to data reduction and reliably compress persistence diagrams by concisely representing them with their weights in the dictionary. Second, we present a dimensionality reduction framework based on a Wasserstein dictionary defined with a small number of atoms (typically three) and encode the dictionary as a low dimensional simplex embedded in a visual space (typically in 2D). In both applications, quantitative experiments assess the relevance of our framework. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.

- **Summary**: Weather recognition is an essential support for many practical life applications, including traffic safety, environment, and meteorology. However, many existing related works cannot comprehensively describe weather conditions due to their complex co-occurrence dependencies. This paper proposes a novel multi-label weather recognition model considering these dependencies. The proposed model called MASK-Convolutional Neural Network-Transformer (MASK-CT) is based on the Transformer, the convolutional process, and the MASK mechanism. The model employs multiple convolutional layers to extract features from weather images and a Transformer encoder to calculate the probability of each weather condition based on the extracted features. To improve the generalization ability of MASK-CT, a MASK mechanism is used during the training phase. The effect of the MASK mechanism is explored and discussed. The Mask mechanism randomly withholds some information from one-pair training instances (one image and its corresponding label). There are two types of MASK methods. Specifically, MASK-I is designed and deployed on the image before feeding it into the weather feature extractor and MASK-II is applied to the image label. The Transformer encoder is then utilized on the randomly masked image features and labels. The experimental results from various real-world weather recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed MASK-CT model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the high-speed dynamic real-time weather recognition capability of the MASK-CT is evaluated.

- **Summary**: Analysis of how semantic concepts are represented within Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a widely used approach in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for interpreting CNNs. A motivation is the need for transparency in safety-critical AI-based systems, as mandated in various domains like automated driving. However, to use the concept representations for safety-relevant purposes, like inspection or error retrieval, these must be of high quality and, in particular, stable. This paper focuses on two stability goals when working with concept representations in computer vision CNNs: stability of concept retrieval and of concept attribution. The guiding use-case is a post-hoc explainability framework for object detection (OD) CNNs, towards which existing concept analysis (CA) methods are successfully adapted. To address concept retrieval stability, we propose a novel metric that considers both concept separation and consistency, and is agnostic to layer and concept representation dimensionality. We then investigate impacts of concept abstraction level, number of concept training samples, CNN size, and concept representation dimensionality on stability. For concept attribution stability we explore the effect of gradient instability on gradient-based explainability methods. The results on various CNNs for classification and object detection yield the main findings that (1) the stability of concept retrieval can be enhanced through dimensionality reduction via data aggregation, and (2) in shallow layers where gradient instability is more pronounced, gradient smoothing techniques are advised. Finally, our approach provides valuable insights into selecting the appropriate layer and concept representation dimensionality, paving the way towards CA in safety-critical XAI applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a dense hybrid proposal modulation (DHPM) method for lane detection. Most existing methods perform sparse supervision on a subset of high-scoring proposals, while other proposals fail to obtain effective shape and location guidance, resulting in poor overall quality. To address this, we densely modulate all proposals to generate topologically and spatially high-quality lane predictions with discriminative representations. Specifically, we first ensure that lane proposals are physically meaningful by applying single-lane shape and location constraints. Benefitting from the proposed proposal-to-label matching algorithm, we assign each proposal a target ground truth lane to efficiently learn from spatial layout priors. To enhance the generalization and model the inter-proposal relations, we diversify the shape difference of proposals matching the same ground-truth lane. In addition to the shape and location constraints, we design a quality-aware classification loss to adaptively supervise each positive proposal so that the discriminative power can be further boosted. Our DHPM achieves very competitive performances on four popular benchmark datasets. Moreover, we consistently outperform the baseline model on most metrics without introducing new parameters and reducing inference speed.

- **Summary**: Building 3D scene graphs has recently emerged as a topic in scene representation for several embodied AI applications to represent the world in a structured and rich manner. With their increased use in solving downstream tasks (eg, navigation and room rearrangement), can we leverage and recycle them for creating 3D maps of environments, a pivotal step in agent operation? We focus on the fundamental problem of aligning pairs of 3D scene graphs whose overlap can range from zero to partial and can contain arbitrary changes. We propose SGAligner, the first method for aligning pairs of 3D scene graphs that is robust to in-the-wild scenarios (ie, unknown overlap -- if any -- and changes in the environment). We get inspired by multi-modality knowledge graphs and use contrastive learning to learn a joint, multi-modal embedding space. We evaluate on the 3RScan dataset and further showcase that our method can be used for estimating the transformation between pairs of 3D scenes. Since benchmarks for these tasks are missing, we create them on this dataset. The code, benchmark, and trained models are available on the project website.

- **Summary**: Terahertz (THz) tomographic imaging has recently attracted significant attention thanks to its non-invasive, non-destructive, non-ionizing, material-classification, and ultra-fast nature for object exploration and inspection. However, its strong water absorption nature and low noise tolerance lead to undesired blurs and distortions of reconstructed THz images. The diffraction-limited THz signals highly constrain the performances of existing restoration methods. To address the problem, we propose a novel multi-view Subspace-Attention-guided Restoration Network (SARNet) that fuses multi-view and multi-spectral features of THz images for effective image restoration and 3D tomographic reconstruction. To this end, SARNet uses multi-scale branches to extract intra-view spatio-spectral amplitude and phase features and fuse them via shared subspace projection and self-attention guidance. We then perform inter-view fusion to further improve the restoration of individual views by leveraging the redundancies between neighboring views. Here, we experimentally construct a THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) system covering a broad frequency range from 0.1 THz to 4 THz for building up a temporal/spectral/spatial/ material THz database of hidden 3D objects. Complementary to a quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our SARNet model on 3D THz tomographic reconstruction applications.

- **Summary**: Model merging (e.g., via interpolation or task arithmetic) fuses multiple models trained on different tasks to generate a multi-task solution. The technique has been proven successful in previous studies, where the models are trained on similar tasks and with the same initialization. In this paper, we expand on this concept to a multimodal setup by merging transformers trained on different modalities. Furthermore, we conduct our study for a novel goal where we can merge vision, language, and cross-modal transformers of a modality-specific architecture to create a parameter-efficient modality-agnostic architecture. Through comprehensive experiments, we systematically investigate the key factors impacting model performance after merging, including initialization, merging mechanisms, and model architectures. Our analysis leads to an effective training recipe for matching the performance of the modality-agnostic baseline (i.e. pre-trained from scratch) via model merging.

- **Summary**: Background: Physiological tremor is defined as an involuntary and rhythmic shaking. Tremor of the hand is a key symptom of multiple neurological diseases, and its frequency and amplitude differs according to both disease type and disease progression. In routine clinical practice, tremor frequency and amplitude are assessed by expert rating using a 0 to 4 integer scale. Such ratings are subjective and have poor inter-rater reliability. There is thus a clinical need for a practical and accurate method for objectively assessing hand tremor.   Objective: to develop a proof of principle method to measure hand tremor amplitude from smartphone videos.   Methods: We created a computer vision pipeline that automatically extracts salient points on the hand and produces a 1-D time series of movement due to tremor, in pixels. Using the smartphones' depth measurement, we convert this measure into real distance units. We assessed the accuracy of the method using 60 videos of simulated tremor of different amplitudes from two healthy adults. Videos were taken at distances of 50, 75 and 100 cm between hand and camera. The participants had skin tone II and VI on the Fitzpatrick scale. We compared our method to a gold-standard measurement from a slide rule. Bland-Altman methods agreement analysis indicated a bias of 0.04 cm and 95% limits of agreement from -1.27 to 1.20 cm. Furthermore, we qualitatively observed that the method was robust to differences in skin tone and limited occlusion, such as a band-aid affixed to the participant's hand.   Clinical relevance: We have demonstrated how tremor amplitude can be measured from smartphone videos. In conjunction with tremor frequency, this approach could be used to help diagnose and monitor neurological diseases

- **Summary**: Trends and opinion mining in social media increasingly focus on novel interactions involving visual media, like images and short videos, in addition to text. In this work, we tackle the problem of visual sentiment analysis of social media images -- specifically, the prediction of image sentiment polarity. While previous work relied on manually labeled training sets, we propose an automated approach for building sentiment polarity classifiers based on a cross-modal distillation paradigm; starting from scraped multimodal (text + images) data, we train a student model on the visual modality based on the outputs of a textual teacher model that analyses the sentiment of the corresponding textual modality. We applied our method to randomly collected images crawled from Twitter over three months and produced, after automatic cleaning, a weakly-labeled dataset of $\sim$1.5 million images. Despite exploiting noisy labeled samples, our training pipeline produces classifiers showing strong generalization capabilities and outperforming the current state of the art on five manually labeled benchmarks for image sentiment polarity prediction.

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation conducts an effective model compression method while holding some limitations:(1) the feature based distillation methods only focus on distilling the feature map but are lack of transferring the relation of data examples; (2) the relational distillation methods are either limited to the handcrafted functions for relation extraction, such as L2 norm, or weak in inter- and intra- class relation modeling. Besides, the feature divergence of heterogeneous teacher-student architectures may lead to inaccurate relational knowledge transferring. In this work, we propose a novel training framework named Class-Oriented Relational Self Distillation (CORSD) to address the limitations. The trainable relation networks are designed to extract relation of structured data input, and they enable the whole model to better classify samples by transferring the relational knowledge from the deepest layer of the model to shallow layers. Besides, auxiliary classifiers are proposed to make relation networks capture class-oriented relation that benefits classification task. Experiments demonstrate that CORSD achieves remarkable improvements. Compared to baseline, 3.8%, 1.5% and 4.5% averaged accuracy boost can be observed on CIFAR100, ImageNet and CUB-200-2011, respectively.

- **Summary**: A road is the skeleton of a city and is a fundamental and important geographical component. Currently, many countries have built geo-information databases and gathered large amounts of geographic data. However, with the extensive construction of infrastructure and rapid expansion of cities, automatic updating of road data is imperative to maintain the high quality of current basic geographic information. However, obtaining bi-phase images for the same area is difficult, and complex post-processing methods are required to update the existing databases.To solve these problems, we proposed a road detection method based on semi-supervised learning (SRUNet) specifically for road-updating applications; in this approach, historical road information was fused with the latest images to directly obtain the latest state of the road.Considering that the texture of a road is complex, a multi-branch network, named the Map Encoding Branch (MEB) was proposed for representation learning, where the Boundary Enhancement Module (BEM) was used to improve the accuracy of boundary prediction, and the Residual Refinement Module (RRM) was used to optimize the prediction results. Further, to fully utilize the limited amount of label information and to enhance the prediction accuracy on unlabeled images, we utilized the mean teacher framework as the basic semi-supervised learning framework and introduced Regional Contrast (ReCo) in our work to improve the model capacity for distinguishing between the characteristics of roads and background elements.We applied our method to two datasets. Our model can effectively improve the performance of a model with fewer labels. Overall, the proposed SRUNet can provide stable, up-to-date, and reliable prediction results for a wide range of road renewal tasks.

- **Summary**: SplitFed Learning, a combination of Federated and Split Learning (FL and SL), is one of the most recent developments in the decentralized machine learning domain. In SplitFed learning, a model is trained by clients and a server collaboratively. For image segmentation, labels are created at each client independently and, therefore, are subject to clients' bias, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose a data quality-based adaptive averaging strategy for SplitFed learning, called QA-SplitFed, to cope with the variation of annotated ground truth (GT) quality over multiple clients. The proposed method is compared against five state-of-the-art model averaging methods on the task of learning human embryo image segmentation. Our experiments show that all five baseline methods fail to maintain accuracy as the number of corrupted clients increases. QA-SplitFed, however, copes effectively with corruption as long as there is at least one uncorrupted client.

- **Summary**: When applied to Image-to-text models, interpretability methods often provide token-by-token explanations namely, they compute a visual explanation for each token of the generated sequence. Those explanations are expensive to compute and unable to comprehensively explain the model's output. Therefore, these models often require some sort of approximation that eventually leads to misleading explanations. We develop a framework based on SHAP, that allows for generating comprehensive, meaningful explanations leveraging the meaning representation of the output sequence as a whole. Moreover, by exploiting semantic priors in the visual backbone, we extract an arbitrary number of features that allows the efficient computation of Shapley values on large-scale models, generating at the same time highly meaningful visual explanations. We demonstrate that our method generates semantically more expressive explanations than traditional methods at a lower compute cost and that it can be generalized over other explainability methods.

- **Summary**: How to efficiently transform large language models (LLMs) into instruction followers is recently a popular research direction, while training LLM for multi-modal reasoning remains less explored. Although the recent LLaMA-Adapter demonstrates the potential to handle visual inputs with LLMs, it still cannot generalize well to open-ended visual instructions and lags behind GPT-4. In this paper, we present LLaMA-Adapter V2, a parameter-efficient visual instruction model. Specifically, we first augment LLaMA-Adapter by unlocking more learnable parameters (e.g., norm, bias and scale), which distribute the instruction-following ability across the entire LLaMA model besides adapters. Secondly, we propose an early fusion strategy to feed visual tokens only into the early LLM layers, contributing to better visual knowledge incorporation. Thirdly, a joint training paradigm of image-text pairs and instruction-following data is introduced by optimizing disjoint groups of learnable parameters. This strategy effectively alleviates the interference between the two tasks of image-text alignment and instruction following and achieves strong multi-modal reasoning with only a small-scale image-text and instruction dataset. During inference, we incorporate additional expert models (e.g. captioning/OCR systems) into LLaMA-Adapter to further enhance its image understanding capability without incurring training costs. Compared to the original LLaMA-Adapter, our LLaMA-Adapter V2 can perform open-ended multi-modal instructions by merely introducing 14M parameters over LLaMA. The newly designed framework also exhibits stronger language-only instruction-following capabilities and even excels in chat interactions.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) made an eye-catching debut recently and inspired many researchers to explore its potential and limitation in terms of zero-shot generalization capability. As the first promptable foundation model for segmentation tasks, it was trained on a large dataset with an unprecedented number of images and annotations. This large-scale dataset and its promptable nature endow the model with strong zero-shot generalization. Although the SAM has shown competitive performance on several datasets, we still want to investigate its zero-shot generalization on medical images. As we know, the acquisition of medical image annotation usually requires a lot of effort from professional practitioners. Therefore, if there exists a foundation model that can give high-quality mask prediction simply based on a few point prompts, this model will undoubtedly become the game changer for medical image analysis. To evaluate whether SAM has the potential to become the foundation model for medical image segmentation tasks, we collected more than 12 public medical image datasets that cover various organs and modalities. We also explore what kind of prompt can lead to the best zero-shot performance with different modalities. Furthermore, we find that a pattern shows that the perturbation of the box size will significantly change the prediction accuracy. Finally, Extensive experiments show that the predicted mask quality varied a lot among different datasets. And providing proper prompts, such as bounding boxes, to the SAM will significantly increase its performance.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive performances in view synthesis by encoding neural representations of a scene. However, NeRFs require hundreds of images per scene to synthesize photo-realistic novel views. Training them on sparse input views leads to overfitting and incorrect scene depth estimation resulting in artifacts in the rendered novel views. Sparse input NeRFs were recently regularized by providing dense depth estimated from pre-trained networks as supervision, to achieve improved performance over sparse depth constraints. However, we find that such depth priors may be inaccurate due to generalization issues. Instead, we hypothesize that the visibility of pixels in different input views can be more reliably estimated to provide dense supervision. In this regard, we compute a visibility prior through the use of plane sweep volumes, which does not require any pre-training. By regularizing the NeRF training with the visibility prior, we successfully train the NeRF with few input views. We reformulate the NeRF to also directly output the visibility of a 3D point from a given viewpoint to reduce the training time with the visibility constraint. On multiple datasets, our model outperforms the competing sparse input NeRF models including those that use learned priors.

- **Summary**: This study aims to develop a novel Cycle-guided Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (CG-DDPM) for cross-modality MRI synthesis. The CG-DDPM deploys two DDPMs that condition each other to generate synthetic images from two different MRI pulse sequences. The two DDPMs exchange random latent noise in the reverse processes, which helps to regularize both DDPMs and generate matching images in two modalities. This improves image-to-image translation ac-curacy. We evaluated the CG-DDPM quantitatively using mean absolute error (MAE), multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MSSIM), and peak sig-nal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), as well as the network synthesis consistency, on the BraTS2020 dataset. Our proposed method showed high accuracy and reliable consistency for MRI synthesis. In addition, we compared the CG-DDPM with several other state-of-the-art networks and demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the image quality of synthetic MRIs. The proposed method enhances the capability of current multimodal MRI synthesis approaches, which could contribute to more accurate diagnosis and better treatment planning for patients by synthesizing additional MRI modalities.

- **Summary**: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21 higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

- **Summary**: Retrieving target information based on input query is of fundamental importance in many real-world applications. In practice, it is not uncommon for the initial search to fail, where additional feedback information is needed to guide the searching process. In this work, we study a setting where the feedback is provided through users clicking liked and disliked searching results. We believe this form of feedback is of great practical interests for its convenience and efficiency. To facilitate future work in this direction, we construct a new benchmark termed click-feedback retrieval based on a large-scale dataset in fashion domain. We demonstrate that incorporating click-feedback can drastically improve the retrieval performance, which validates the value of the proposed setting. We also introduce several methods to utilize click-feedback during training, and show that click-feedback-guided training can significantly enhance the retrieval quality. We hope further exploration in this direction can bring new insights on building more efficient and user-friendly search engines.

- **Summary**: Inspired by recent findings that generative diffusion models learn semantically meaningful representations, we use them to discover the intrinsic hierarchical structure in biomedical 3D images using unsupervised segmentation. We show that features of diffusion models from different stages of a U-Net-based ladder-like architecture capture different hierarchy levels in 3D biomedical images. We design three losses to train a predictive unsupervised segmentation network that encourages the decomposition of 3D volumes into meaningful nested subvolumes that represent a hierarchy. First, we pretrain 3D diffusion models and use the consistency of their features across subvolumes. Second, we use the visual consistency between subvolumes. Third, we use the invariance to photometric augmentations as a regularizer. Our models achieve better performance than prior unsupervised structure discovery approaches on challenging biologically-inspired synthetic datasets and on a real-world brain tumor MRI dataset.

- **Summary**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing a face mask has been known to be an effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In lots of monitoring tasks, humans have been replaced with computers thanks to the outstanding performance of the deep learning models. Monitoring the wearing of a face mask is another task that can be done by deep learning models with acceptable accuracy. The main challenge of this task is the limited amount of data because of the quarantine. In this paper, we did an investigation on the capability of three state-of-the-art object detection neural networks on face mask detection for real-time applications. As mentioned, here are three models used, Single Shot Detector (SSD), two versions of You Only Look Once (YOLO) i.e., YOLOv4-tiny, and YOLOv4-tiny-3l from which the best was selected. In the proposed method, according to the performance of different models, the best model that can be suitable for use in real-world and mobile device applications in comparison to other recent studies was the YOLOv4-tiny model, with 85.31% and 50.66 for mean Average Precision (mAP) and Frames Per Second (FPS), respectively. These acceptable values were achieved using two datasets with only 1531 images in three separate classes.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a methodology to shape a fisheye-specific representation space that reflects the interaction between distortion and semantic context present in this data modality. Fisheye data has the wider field of view advantage over other types of cameras, but this comes at the expense of high radial distortion. As a result, objects further from the center exhibit deformations that make it difficult for a model to identify their semantic context. While previous work has attempted architectural and training augmentation changes to alleviate this effect, no work has attempted to guide the model towards learning a representation space that reflects this interaction between distortion and semantic context inherent to fisheye data. We introduce an approach to exploit this relationship by first extracting distortion class labels based on an object's distance from the center of the image. We then shape a backbone's representation space with a weighted contrastive loss that constrains objects of the same semantic class and distortion class to be close to each other within a lower dimensional embedding space. This backbone trained with both semantic and distortion information is then fine-tuned within an object detection setting to empirically evaluate the quality of the learnt representation. We show this method leads to performance improvements by as much as 1.1% mean average precision over standard object detection strategies and .6% improvement over other state of the art representation learning approaches.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method for predicting unlabeled target domain data, specific to complex UDA tasks where the domain gap is significant. Mainstream UDA models aim to learn from both domains and improve target discrimination by utilizing labeled source domain data. However, the performance boost may be limited when the discrepancy between the source and target domains is large or the target domain contains outliers. To explicitly address this issue, we propose the Adversarial self-superVised domain Adaptation network for the TARget domain (AVATAR) algorithm. It outperforms state-of-the-art UDA models by concurrently reducing domain discrepancy while enhancing discrimination through domain adversarial learning, self-supervised learning, and sample selection strategy for the target domain, all guided by deep clustering. Our proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three UDA benchmarks, and extensive ablation studies and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for addressing complex UDA tasks.

- **Summary**: Inverse consistency is a desirable property for image registration. We propose a simple technique to make a neural registration network inverse consistent by construction, as a consequence of its structure, as long as it parameterizes its output transform by a Lie group. We extend this technique to multi-step neural registration by composing many such networks in a way that preserves inverse consistency. This multi-step approach also allows for inverse-consistent coarse to fine registration. We evaluate our technique on synthetic 2-D data and four 3-D medical image registration tasks and obtain excellent registration accuracy while assuring inverse consistency.

- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely employed for diagnostic tests in neurology. However, the utility of MRI is largely limited by its long acquisition time. Acquiring fewer k-space data in a sparse manner is a potential solution to reducing the acquisition time, but it can lead to severe aliasing reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we present a novel Dual-Domain Cross-Iteration Squeeze and Excitation Network (DD-CISENet) for accelerated sparse MRI reconstruction. The information of k-spaces and MRI images can be iteratively fused and maintained using the Cross-Iteration Residual connection (CIR) structures. This study included 720 multi-coil brain MRI cases adopted from the open-source fastMRI Dataset. Results showed that the average reconstruction error by DD-CISENet was 2.28 $\pm$ 0.57%, which outperformed existing deep learning methods including image-domain prediction (6.03 $\pm$ 1.31, p < 0.001), k-space synthesis (6.12 $\pm$ 1.66, p < 0.001), and dual-domain feature fusion approaches (4.05 $\pm$ 0.88, p < 0.001).

- **Summary**: We present Multiscale Multiview Vision Transformers (MMViT), which introduces multiscale feature maps and multiview encodings to transformer models. Our model encodes different views of the input signal and builds several channel-resolution feature stages to process the multiple views of the input at different resolutions in parallel. At each scale stage, we use a cross-attention block to fuse information across different views. This enables the MMViT model to acquire complex high-dimensional representations of the input at different resolutions. The proposed model can serve as a backbone model in multiple domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MMViT on audio and image classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Segmentation in medical imaging is a critical component for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of various diseases and medical conditions. Presently, the medical segmentation landscape is dominated by numerous specialized deep learning models, each fine-tuned for specific segmentation tasks and image modalities. The recently-introduced Segment Anything Model (SAM) employs the ViT neural architecture and harnesses a massive training dataset to segment nearly any object; however, its suitability to the medical domain has not yet been investigated. In this study, we explore the zero-shot performance of SAM in medical imaging by implementing eight distinct prompt strategies across six datasets from four imaging modalities, including X-ray, ultrasound, dermatoscopy, and colonoscopy. Our findings reveal that SAM's zero-shot performance is not only comparable to, but in certain cases, surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Based on these results, we propose practical guidelines that require minimal interaction while consistently yielding robust outcomes across all assessed contexts. The source code, along with a demonstration of the recommended guidelines, can be accessed at https://github.com/Malta-Lab/SAM-zero-shot-in-Medical-Imaging.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid representation and end-to-end trainable network architecture to model fully editable and customizable neural avatars. At the core of our work lies a representation that combines the modeling power of neural fields with the ease of use and inherent 3D consistency of skinned meshes. To this end, we construct a trainable feature codebook to store local geometry and texture features on the vertices of a deformable body model, thus exploiting its consistent topology under articulation. This representation is then employed in a generative auto-decoder architecture that admits fitting to unseen scans and sampling of realistic avatars with varied appearances and geometries. Furthermore, our representation allows local editing by swapping local features between 3D assets. To verify our method for avatar creation and editing, we contribute a new high-quality dataset, dubbed CustomHumans, for training and evaluation. Our experiments quantitatively and qualitatively show that our method generates diverse detailed avatars and achieves better model fitting performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our code and dataset are available at https://custom-humans.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Moving Object Segmentation (MOS), a crucial task in computer vision, has numerous applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and video analytics. Existing datasets for moving object segmentation mainly focus on RGB or Lidar videos, but lack additional event information that can enhance the understanding of dynamic scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dataset, called DSEC-MOS. Our dataset includes frames captured by RGB cameras embedded on moving vehicules and incorporates event data, which provide high temporal resolution and low-latency information about changes in the scenes. To generate accurate segmentation mask annotations for moving objects, we apply the recently emerged large model SAM - Segment Anything Model - with moving object bounding boxes from DSEC-MOD serving as prompts and calibrated RGB frames, then further revise the results. Our DSEC-MOS dataset contains in total 16 sequences (13314 images). To the best of our knowledge, DSEC-MOS is also the first moving object segmentation dataset that includes event camera in autonomous driving. Project Page: https://github.com/ZZY-Zhou/DSEC-MOS.
