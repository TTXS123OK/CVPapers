- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is a vital problem in computer vision. Recently, a common solution to semantic segmentation is the end-to-end convolution neural network, which is much more accurate than traditional methods.Recently, the decoders based on attention achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various datasets. But these networks always are compared with the mIoU of previous SOTA networks to prove their superiority and ignore their characteristics without considering the computation complexity and precision in various categories, which is essential for engineering applications. Besides, the methods to analyze the FLOPs and memory are not consistent between different networks, which makes the comparison hard to be utilized. What's more, various methods utilize attention in semantic segmentation, but the conclusion of these methods is lacking. This paper first conducts experiments to analyze their computation complexity and compare their performance. Then it summarizes suitable scenes for these networks and concludes key points that should be concerned when constructing an attention network. Last it points out some future directions of the attention network.

- **Summary**: Clinically, automated polyp segmentation techniques have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical diagnosis, thereby reducing the risk of colorectal cancer in patients. Unfortunately, existing methods suffer from two significant weaknesses that can impact the accuracy of segmentation. Firstly, features extracted by encoders are not adequately filtered and utilized. Secondly, semantic conflicts and information redundancy caused by feature fusion are not attended to. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach for polyp segmentation, named MLFF-Net, which leverages multi-level feature fusion and attention mechanisms. Specifically, MLFF-Net comprises three modules: Multi-scale Attention Module (MAM), High-level Feature Enhancement Module (HFEM), and Global Attention Module (GAM). Among these, MAM is used to extract multi-scale information and polyp details from the shallow output of the encoder. In HFEM, the deep features of the encoders complement each other by aggregation. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism redistributes the weight of the aggregated features, weakening the conflicting redundant parts and highlighting the information useful to the task. GAM combines features from the encoder and decoder features, as well as computes global dependencies to prevent receptive field locality. Experimental results on five public datasets show that the proposed method not only can segment multiple types of polyps but also has advantages over current state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization ability.

- **Summary**: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) is an effective imaging tool for diagnosis tasks that require motion tracking of a certain anatomy. To speed up DMRI acquisition, k-space measurements are commonly undersampled along spatial or spatial-temporal domains. The difficulty of recovering useful information increases with increasing undersampling ratios. Compress sensing was invented for this purpose and has become the most popular method until deep learning (DL) based DMRI reconstruction methods emerged in the past decade. Nevertheless, existing DL networks are still limited in long-range sequential dependency understanding and computational efficiency and are not fully automated. Considering the success of Transformers positional embedding and "swin window" self-attention mechanism in the vision community, especially natural video understanding, we hereby propose a novel architecture named Reconstruction Swin Transformer (RST) for 4D MRI. RST inherits the backbone design of the Video Swin Transformer with a novel reconstruction head introduced to restore pixel-wise intensity. A convolution network called SADXNet is used for rapid initialization of 2D MR frames before RST learning to effectively reduce the model complexity, GPU hardware demand, and training time. Experimental results in the cardiac 4D MR dataset further substantiate the superiority of RST, achieving the lowest RMSE of 0.0286 +/- 0.0199 and 1 - SSIM of 0.0872 +/- 0.0783 on 9 times accelerated validation sequences.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-based semantic scene understanding is an important module in the modern autonomous driving perception stack. However, identifying Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) points in a LiDAR point cloud is challenging as point clouds lack semantically rich features when compared with RGB images. We revisit this problem from the perspective of selective classification, which introduces a selective function into the standard closed-set classification setup. Our solution is built upon the basic idea of abstaining from choosing any known categories but learns a point-wise abstaining penalty with a marginbased loss. Synthesizing outliers to approximate unlimited OOD samples is also critical to this idea, so we propose a strong synthesis pipeline that generates outliers originated from various factors: unrealistic object categories, sampling patterns and sizes. We demonstrate that learning different abstaining penalties, apart from point-wise penalty, for different types of (synthesized) outliers can further improve the performance. We benchmark our method on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes and achieve state-of-the-art results. Risk-coverage analysis further reveals intrinsic properties of different methods. Codes and models will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: It is significant to evaluate the security of existing digital image tampering localization algorithms in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an adversarial attack scheme to reveal the reliability of such tampering localizers, which would be fooled and fail to predict altered regions correctly. Specifically, the adversarial examples based on optimization and gradient are implemented for white/black-box attacks. Correspondingly, the adversarial example is optimized via reverse gradient propagation, and the perturbation is added adaptively in the direction of gradient rising. The black-box attack is achieved by relying on the transferability of such adversarial examples to different localizers. Extensive evaluations verify that the proposed attack sharply reduces the localization accuracy while preserving high visual quality of the attacked images.



### UPL-SFDA: Uncertainty-aware Pseudo Label Guided Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation

- **Summary**: Domain Adaptation (DA) is important for deep learning-based medical image segmentation models to deal with testing images from a new target domain. As the source-domain data are usually unavailable when a trained model is deployed at a new center, Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing for data and annotation-efficient adaptation to the target domain. However, existing SFDA methods have a limited performance due to lack of sufficient supervision with source-domain images unavailable and target-domain images unlabeled. We propose a novel Uncertainty-aware Pseudo Label guided (UPL) SFDA method for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we propose Target Domain Growing (TDG) to enhance the diversity of predictions in the target domain by duplicating the pre-trained model's prediction head multiple times with perturbations. The different predictions in these duplicated heads are used to obtain pseudo labels for unlabeled target-domain images and their uncertainty to identify reliable pseudo labels. We also propose a Twice Forward pass Supervision (TFS) strategy that uses reliable pseudo labels obtained in one forward pass to supervise predictions in the next forward pass. The adaptation is further regularized by a mean prediction-based entropy minimization term that encourages confident and consistent results in different prediction heads. UPL-SFDA was validated with a multi-site heart MRI segmentation dataset, a cross-modality fetal brain segmentation dataset, and a 3D fetal tissue segmentation dataset. It improved the average Dice by 5.54, 5.01 and 6.89 percentage points for the three tasks compared with the baseline, respectively, and outperformed several state-of-the-art SFDA methods.

- **Summary**: While showing promising results, recent RGB-D camera-based category-level object pose estimation methods have restricted applications due to the heavy reliance on depth sensors. RGB-only methods provide an alternative to this problem yet suffer from inherent scale ambiguity stemming from monocular observations. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline that decouples the 6D pose and size estimation to mitigate the influence of imperfect scales on rigid transformations. Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained monocular estimator to extract local geometric information, mainly facilitating the search for inlier 2D-3D correspondence. Meanwhile, a separate branch is designed to directly recover the metric scale of the object based on category-level statistics. Finally, we advocate using the RANSAC-P$n$P algorithm to robustly solve for 6D object pose. Extensive experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of our method over previous state-of-the-art RGB-based approaches, especially in terms of rotation accuracy.

- **Summary**: This study reveals a possible correlation between splashing morphology and the normalized impact force exerted by an impacting drop on a solid surface. This finding is obtained from a newly proposed feature extraction method and a subsequent interpretation of the classification of splashing and non-splashing drops performed by an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) video classifier. Notably, the values of the weight matrix elements of the XAI that correspond to the extracted features are found to change with the temporal evolution of the drop morphology. We compute the rate of change of the contributions of each frame with respect to the classification value of a video as an important index to quantify the contributions of the extracted splashing and non-splashing features at different impact times to the classification of the XAI model. Remarkably, the rate computed for the extracted splashing features is found to closely match the profile of the normalized impact force, where the splashing features are most pronounced immediately after the normalized impact force reaches its peak value. This study has provided an example that clarifies the relationship between the complex morphological evolution of a splashing drop and physical parameters by interpreting the classification of an XAI video classifier.

- **Summary**: We introduce POP3D, a novel framework that creates a full $360^\circ$-view 3D model from a single image. POP3D resolves two prominent issues that limit the single-view reconstruction. Firstly, POP3D offers substantial generalizability to arbitrary categories, a trait that previous methods struggle to achieve. Secondly, POP3D further improves reconstruction fidelity and naturalness, a crucial aspect that concurrent works fall short of. Our approach marries the strengths of four primary components: (1) a monocular depth and normal predictor that serves to predict crucial geometric cues, (2) a space carving method capable of demarcating the potentially unseen portions of the target object, (3) a generative model pre-trained on a large-scale image dataset that can complete unseen regions of the target, and (4) a neural implicit surface reconstruction method tailored in reconstructing objects using RGB images along with monocular geometric cues. The combination of these components enables POP3D to readily generalize across various in-the-wild images and generate state-of-the-art reconstructions, outperforming similar works by a significant margin.

- **Summary**: Multi-domain learning (MDL) aims to train a model with minimal average risk across multiple overlapping but non-identical domains. To tackle the challenges of dataset bias and domain domination, numerous MDL approaches have been proposed from the perspectives of seeking commonalities by aligning distributions to reduce domain gap or reserving differences by implementing domain-specific towers, gates, and even experts. MDL models are becoming more and more complex with sophisticated network architectures or loss functions, introducing extra parameters and enlarging computation costs. In this paper, we propose a frustratingly easy and hyperparameter-free multi-domain learning method named Decoupled Training(D-Train). D-Train is a tri-phase general-to-specific training strategy that first pre-trains on all domains to warm up a root model, then post-trains on each domain by splitting into multi heads, and finally fine-tunes the heads by fixing the backbone, enabling decouple training to achieve domain independence. Despite its extraordinary simplicity and efficiency, D-Train performs remarkably well in extensive evaluations of various datasets from standard benchmarks to applications of satellite imagery and recommender systems.

- **Summary**: Accurate estimation of stereo camera extrinsic parameters is the key to guarantee the performance of stereo matching algorithms. In prior arts, the online self-calibration of stereo cameras has commonly been formulated as a specialized visual odometry problem, without taking into account the principles of stereo rectification. In this paper, we first delve deeply into the concept of rectifying homography, which serves as the cornerstone for the development of our novel stereo camera online self-calibration algorithm, for cases where only a single pair of images is available. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective solution for globally optimum extrinsic parameter estimation in the presence of stereo video sequences. Additionally, we emphasize the impracticality of using three Euler angles and three components in the translation vectors for performance quantification. Instead, we introduce four new evaluation metrics to quantify the robustness and accuracy of extrinsic parameter estimation, applicable to both single-pair and multi-pair cases. Extensive experiments conducted across indoor and outdoor environments using various experimental setups validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. The comprehensive evaluation results demonstrate its superior performance in comparison to the baseline algorithm. Our source code, demo video, and supplement are publicly available at mias.group/StereoCalibrator.

- **Summary**: Eliminating the rain degradation in stereo images poses a formidable challenge, which necessitates the efficient exploitation of mutual information present between the dual views. To this end, we devise MQINet, which employs multi-dimension queries and interactions for stereo image deraining. More specifically, our approach incorporates a context-aware dimension-wise queried block (CDQB). This module leverages dimension-wise queries that are independent of the input features and employs global context-aware attention (GCA) to capture essential features while avoiding the entanglement of redundant or irrelevant information. Meanwhile, we introduce an intra-view physics-aware attention (IPA) based on the inverse physical model of rainy images. IPA extracts shallow features that are sensitive to the physics of rain degradation, facilitating the reduction of rain-related artifacts during the early learning period. Furthermore, we integrate a cross-view multi-dimension interacting attention mechanism (CMIA) to foster comprehensive feature interaction between the two views across multiple dimensions. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our model over EPRRNet and StereoIRR, achieving respective improvements of 4.18 dB and 0.45 dB in PSNR.

- **Summary**: 2D irregular shape packing is a necessary step to arrange UV patches of a 3D model within a texture atlas for memory-efficient appearance rendering in computer graphics. Being a joint, combinatorial decision-making problem involving all patch positions and orientations, this problem has well-known NP-hard complexity. Prior solutions either assume a heuristic packing order or modify the upstream mesh cut and UV mapping to simplify the problem, which either limits the packing ratio or incurs robustness or generality issues. Instead, we introduce a learning-assisted 2D irregular shape packing method that achieves a high packing quality with minimal requirements from the input. Our method iteratively selects and groups subsets of UV patches into near-rectangular super patches, essentially reducing the problem to bin-packing, based on which a joint optimization is employed to further improve the packing ratio. In order to efficiently deal with large problem instances with hundreds of patches, we train deep neural policies to predict nearly rectangular patch subsets and determine their relative poses, leading to linear time scaling with the number of patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three datasets for UV packing, where our method achieves a higher packing ratio over several widely used baselines with competitive computational speed.

- **Summary**: We present LoD-NeuS, an efficient neural representation for high-frequency geometry detail recovery and anti-aliased novel view rendering. Drawing inspiration from voxel-based representations with the level of detail (LoD), we introduce a multi-scale tri-plane-based scene representation that is capable of capturing the LoD of the signed distance function (SDF) and the space radiance. Our representation aggregates space features from a multi-convolved featurization within a conical frustum along a ray and optimizes the LoD feature volume through differentiable rendering. Additionally, we propose an error-guided sampling strategy to guide the growth of the SDF during the optimization. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior surface reconstruction and photorealistic view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Adversarial purification using generative models demonstrates strong adversarial defense performance. These methods are classifier and attack-agnostic, making them versatile but often computationally intensive. Recent strides in diffusion and score networks have improved image generation and, by extension, adversarial purification. Another highly efficient class of adversarial defense methods known as adversarial training requires specific knowledge of attack vectors, forcing them to be trained extensively on adversarial examples. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new framework, namely Language Guided Adversarial Purification (LGAP), utilizing pre-trained diffusion models and caption generators to defend against adversarial attacks. Given an input image, our method first generates a caption, which is then used to guide the adversarial purification process through a diffusion network. Our approach has been evaluated against strong adversarial attacks, proving its effectiveness in enhancing adversarial robustness. Our results indicate that LGAP outperforms most existing adversarial defense techniques without requiring specialized network training. This underscores the generalizability of models trained on large datasets, highlighting a promising direction for further research.

- **Summary**: The recent advancements in deep convolutional neural networks have shown significant promise in the domain of road scene parsing. Nevertheless, the existing works focus primarily on freespace detection, with little attention given to hazardous road defects that could compromise both driving safety and comfort. In this paper, we introduce RoadFormer, a novel Transformer-based data-fusion network developed for road scene parsing. RoadFormer utilizes a duplex encoder architecture to extract heterogeneous features from both RGB images and surface normal information. The encoded features are subsequently fed into a novel heterogeneous feature synergy block for effective feature fusion and recalibration. The pixel decoder then learns multi-scale long-range dependencies from the fused and recalibrated heterogeneous features, which are subsequently processed by a Transformer decoder to produce the final semantic prediction. Additionally, we release SYN-UDTIRI, the first large-scale road scene parsing dataset that contains over 10,407 RGB images, dense depth images, and the corresponding pixel-level annotations for both freespace and road defects of different shapes and sizes. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on our SYN-UDTIRI dataset, as well as on three public datasets, including KITTI road, CityScapes, and ORFD, demonstrate that RoadFormer outperforms all other state-of-the-art networks for road scene parsing. Specifically, RoadFormer ranks first on the KITTI road benchmark. Our source code, created dataset, and demo video are publicly available at mias.group/RoadFormer.

- **Summary**: Multiple pedestrian tracking faces the challenge of tracking pedestrians in the presence of occlusion. Existing methods suffer from inaccurate motion estimation, appearance feature extraction, and association due to occlusion, leading to inadequate Identification F1-Score (IDF1), excessive ID switches (IDSw), and insufficient association accuracy and recall (AssA and AssR). We found that the main reason is abnormal detections caused by partial occlusion. In this paper, we suggest that the key insight is explicit motion estimation, reliable appearance features, and fair association in occlusion scenes. Specifically, we propose an adaptive occlusion-aware multiple pedestrian tracker, OccluTrack. We first introduce an abnormal motion suppression mechanism into the Kalman Filter to adaptively detect and suppress outlier motions caused by partial occlusion. Second, we propose a pose-guided re-ID module to extract discriminative part features for partially occluded pedestrians. Last, we design a new occlusion-aware association method towards fair IoU and appearance embedding distance measurement for occluded pedestrians. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our OccluTrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MOT-Challenge datasets. Particularly, the improvements on IDF1, IDSw, AssA, and AssR demonstrate the effectiveness of our OccluTrack on tracking and association performance.

- **Summary**: This paper examines the robustness of a multi-modal computer vision model, CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), in the context of unsupervised learning. The main objective is twofold: first, to evaluate the robustness of CLIP, and second, to explore strategies for augmenting its robustness. To achieve this, we introduce a novel approach named LP-CLIP. This technique involves the distillation of CLIP features through the incorporation of a linear probing layer positioned atop its encoding structure. This newly added layer is trained utilizing pseudo-labels produced by CLIP, coupled with a self-training strategy. The LP-CLIP technique offers a promising approach to enhance the robustness of CLIP without the need for annotations. By leveraging a simple linear probing layer, we aim to improve the model's ability to withstand various uncertainties and challenges commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. Importantly, our approach does not rely on annotated data, which makes it particularly valuable in situations where labeled data might be scarce or costly to obtain. Our proposed approach increases the robustness of CLIP with SOTA results compared to supervised technique on various datasets.

- **Summary**: An accurate and uncertainty-aware 3D human body pose estimation is key to enabling truly safe but efficient human-robot interactions. Current uncertainty-aware methods in 3D human pose estimation are limited to predicting the uncertainty of the body posture, while effectively neglecting the body shape and root pose. In this work, we present GloPro, which to the best of our knowledge the first framework to predict an uncertainty distribution of a 3D body mesh including its shape, pose, and root pose, by efficiently fusing visual clues with a learned motion model. We demonstrate that it vastly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of human trajectory accuracy in a world coordinate system (even in the presence of severe occlusions), yields consistent uncertainty distributions, and can run in real-time.

- **Summary**: Effective communication between humans and intelligent agents has promising applications for solving complex problems. One such approach is visual dialogue, which leverages multimodal context to assist humans. However, real-world scenarios occasionally involve human mistakes, which can cause intelligent agents to fail. While most prior research assumes perfect answers from human interlocutors, we focus on a setting where the agent points out unintentional mistakes for the interlocutor to review, better reflecting real-world situations. In this paper, we show that human answer mistakes depend on question type and QA turn in the visual dialogue by analyzing a previously unused data collection of human mistakes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of those factors for the model's accuracy in a pointing-human-mistake task through experiments using a simple MLP model and a Visual Language Model.

- **Summary**: While recent 3D-aware generative models have shown photo-realistic image synthesis with multi-view consistency, the synthesized image quality degrades depending on the camera pose (e.g., a face with a blurry and noisy boundary at a side viewpoint). Such degradation is mainly caused by the difficulty of learning both pose consistency and photo-realism simultaneously from a dataset with heavily imbalanced poses. In this paper, we propose SideGAN, a novel 3D GAN training method to generate photo-realistic images irrespective of the camera pose, especially for faces of side-view angles. To ease the challenging problem of learning photo-realistic and pose-consistent image synthesis, we split the problem into two subproblems, each of which can be solved more easily. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a combination of two simple discrimination problems, one of which learns to discriminate whether a synthesized image looks real or not, and the other learns to discriminate whether a synthesized image agrees with the camera pose. Based on this, we propose a dual-branched discriminator with two discrimination branches. We also propose a pose-matching loss to learn the pose consistency of 3D GANs. In addition, we present a pose sampling strategy to increase learning opportunities for steep angles in a pose-imbalanced dataset. With extensive validation, we demonstrate that our approach enables 3D GANs to generate high-quality geometries and photo-realistic images irrespective of the camera pose.

- **Summary**: We present a new method for automatically classifying medical images that uses weak causal signals in the scene to model how the presence of a feature in one part of the image affects the appearance of another feature in a different part of the image. Our method consists of two components: a convolutional neural network backbone and a causality-factors extractor module. The latter computes weights for the feature maps to enhance each feature map according to its causal influence in the image's scene. We can modify the functioning of the causality module by using two external signals, thus obtaining different variants of our method. We evaluate our method on a public dataset of prostate MRI images for prostate cancer diagnosis, using quantitative experiments, qualitative assessment, and ablation studies. Our results show that our method improves classification performance and produces more robust predictions, focusing on relevant parts of the image. That is especially important in medical imaging, where accurate and reliable classifications are essential for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.

- **Summary**: This study investigates object presence detection and localization in remote sensing imagery, focusing on solar panel recognition. We explore different levels of supervision, evaluating three models: a fully supervised object detector, a weakly supervised image classifier with CAM-based localization, and a minimally supervised anomaly detector. The classifier excels in binary presence detection (0.79 F1-score), while the object detector (0.72) offers precise localization. The anomaly detector requires more data for viable performance. Fusion of model results shows potential accuracy gains. CAM impacts localization modestly, with GradCAM, GradCAM++, and HiResCAM yielding superior results. Notably, the classifier remains robust with less data, in contrast to the object detector.

- **Summary**: In scene graph generation (SGG), learning with cross-entropy loss yields biased predictions owing to the severe imbalance in the distribution of the relationship labels in the dataset. Thus, this study proposes a method to generate scene graphs using optimal transport as a measure for comparing two probability distributions. We apply learning with the optimal transport loss, which reflects the similarity between the labels in terms of transportation cost, for predicate classification in SGG. In the proposed approach, the transportation cost of the optimal transport is defined using the similarity of words obtained from the pre-trained model. The experimental evaluation of the effectiveness demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of mean Recall@50 and 100. Furthermore, it improves the recall of the relationship labels scarcely available in the dataset.

- **Summary**: Robust 3D perception under corruption has become an essential task for the realm of 3D vision. While current data augmentation techniques usually perform random transformations on all point cloud objects in an offline way and ignore the structure of the samples, resulting in over-or-under enhancement. In this work, we propose an alternative to make sample-adaptive transformations based on the structure of the sample to cope with potential corruption via an auto-augmentation framework, named as AdaptPoint. Specially, we leverage a imitator, consisting of a Deformation Controller and a Mask Controller, respectively in charge of predicting deformation parameters and producing a per-point mask, based on the intrinsic structural information of the input point cloud, and then conduct corruption simulations on top. Then a discriminator is utilized to prevent the generation of excessive corruption that deviates from the original data distribution. In addition, a perception-guidance feedback mechanism is incorporated to guide the generation of samples with appropriate difficulty level. Furthermore, to address the paucity of real-world corrupted point cloud, we also introduce a new dataset ScanObjectNN-C, that exhibits greater similarity to actual data in real-world environments, especially when contrasted with preceding CAD datasets. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple corruption benchmarks, including ModelNet-C, our ScanObjectNN-C, and ShapeNet-C.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are emerging expressive generative models, in which a large number of time steps (inference steps) are required for a single image generation. To accelerate such tedious process, reducing steps uniformly is considered as an undisputed principle of diffusion models. We consider that such a uniform assumption is not the optimal solution in practice; i.e., we can find different optimal time steps for different models. Therefore, we propose to search the optimal time steps sequence and compressed model architecture in a unified framework to achieve effective image generation for diffusion models without any further training. Specifically, we first design a unified search space that consists of all possible time steps and various architectures. Then, a two stage evolutionary algorithm is introduced to find the optimal solution in the designed search space. To further accelerate the search process, we employ FID score between generated and real samples to estimate the performance of the sampled examples. As a result, the proposed method is (i).training-free, obtaining the optimal time steps and model architecture without any training process; (ii). orthogonal to most advanced diffusion samplers and can be integrated to gain better sample quality. (iii). generalized, where the searched time steps and architectures can be directly applied on different diffusion models with the same guidance scale. Experimental results show that our method achieves excellent performance by using only a few time steps, e.g. 17.86 FID score on ImageNet 64 $\times$ 64 with only four steps, compared to 138.66 with DDIM.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the unsupervised speech enhancement problem based on recurrent variational autoencoder (RVAE). This approach offers promising generalization performance over the supervised counterpart. Nevertheless, the involved iterative variational expectation-maximization (VEM) process at test time, which relies on a variational inference method, results in high computational complexity. To tackle this issue, we present efficient sampling techniques based on Langevin dynamics and Metropolis-Hasting algorithms, adapted to the EM-based speech enhancement with RVAE. By directly sampling from the intractable posterior distribution within the EM process, we circumvent the intricacies of variational inference. We conduct a series of experiments, comparing the proposed methods with VEM and a state-of-the-art supervised speech enhancement approach based on diffusion models. The results reveal that our sampling-based algorithms significantly outperform VEM, not only in terms of computational efficiency but also in overall performance. Furthermore, when compared to the supervised baseline, our methods showcase robust generalization performance in mismatched test conditions.

- **Summary**: Recently, conditional score-based diffusion models have gained significant attention in the field of supervised speech enhancement, yielding state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods may face challenges when generalising to unseen conditions. To address this issue, we introduce an alternative approach that operates in an unsupervised manner, leveraging the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, in a training phase, a clean speech prior distribution is learnt in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain using score-based diffusion models, allowing it to unconditionally generate clean speech from Gaussian noise. Then, we develop a posterior sampling methodology for speech enhancement by combining the learnt clean speech prior with a noise model for speech signal inference. The noise parameters are simultaneously learnt along with clean speech estimation through an iterative expectationmaximisation (EM) approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exploring diffusion-based generative models for unsupervised speech enhancement, demonstrating promising results compared to a recent variational auto-encoder (VAE)-based unsupervised approach and a state-of-the-art diffusion-based supervised method. It thus opens a new direction for future research in unsupervised speech enhancement.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based generative models have recently gained attention in speech enhancement (SE), providing an alternative to conventional supervised methods. These models transform clean speech training samples into Gaussian noise centered at noisy speech, and subsequently learn a parameterized model to reverse this process, conditionally on noisy speech. Unlike supervised methods, generative-based SE approaches usually rely solely on an unsupervised loss, which may result in less efficient incorporation of conditioned noisy speech. To address this issue, we propose augmenting the original diffusion training objective with a mean squared error (MSE) loss, measuring the discrepancy between estimated enhanced speech and ground-truth clean speech at each reverse process iteration. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional facial stereophotogrammetry provides a detailed representation of craniofacial soft tissue without the use of ionizing radiation. While manual annotation of landmarks serves as the current gold standard for cephalometric analysis, it is a time-consuming process and is prone to human error. The aim in this study was to develop and evaluate an automated cephalometric annotation method using a deep learning-based approach. Ten landmarks were manually annotated on 2897 3D facial photographs by a single observer. The automated landmarking workflow involved two successive DiffusionNet models and additional algorithms for facial segmentation. The dataset was randomly divided into a training and test dataset. The training dataset was used to train the deep learning networks, whereas the test dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the automated workflow. The precision of the workflow was evaluated by calculating the Euclidean distances between the automated and manual landmarks and compared to the intra-observer and inter-observer variability of manual annotation and the semi-automated landmarking method. The workflow was successful in 98.6% of all test cases. The deep learning-based landmarking method achieved precise and consistent landmark annotation. The mean precision of 1.69 (+/-1.15) mm was comparable to the inter-observer variability (1.31 +/-0.91 mm) of manual annotation. The Euclidean distance between the automated and manual landmarks was within 2 mm in 69%. Automated landmark annotation on 3D photographs was achieved with the DiffusionNet-based approach. The proposed method allows quantitative analysis of large datasets and may be used in diagnosis, follow-up, and virtual surgical planning.

- **Summary**: We aim for accurate and efficient line landmark detection for valet parking, which is a long-standing yet unsolved problem in autonomous driving. To this end, we present a deep line landmark detection system where we carefully design the modules to be lightweight. Specifically, we first empirically design four general line landmarks including three physical lines and one novel mental line. The four line landmarks are effective for valet parking. We then develop a deep network (LineMarkNet) to detect line landmarks from surround-view cameras where we, via the pre-calibrated homography, fuse context from four separate cameras into the unified bird-eye-view (BEV) space, specifically we fuse the surroundview features and BEV features, then employ the multi-task decoder to detect multiple line landmarks where we apply the center-based strategy for object detection task, and design our graph transformer to enhance the vision transformer with hierarchical level graph reasoning for semantic segmentation task. At last, we further parameterize the detected line landmarks (e.g., intercept-slope form) whereby a novel filtering backend incorporates temporal and multi-view consistency to achieve smooth and stable detection. Moreover, we annotate a large-scale dataset to validate our method. Experimental results show that our framework achieves the enhanced performance compared with several line detection methods and validate the multi-task network's efficiency about the real-time line landmark detection on the Qualcomm 820A platform while meantime keeps superior accuracy, with our deep line landmark detection system.

- **Summary**: Catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge is a critical issue in continual learning typically handled through various regularization strategies. However, existing methods struggle especially when several incremental steps are performed. In this paper, we extend our previous approach (RECALL) and tackle forgetting by exploiting unsupervised web-crawled data to retrieve examples of old classes from online databases. Differently from the original approach that did not perform any evaluation of the web data, here we introduce two novel approaches based on adversarial learning and adaptive thresholding to select from web data only samples strongly resembling the statistics of the no longer available training ones. Furthermore, we improved the pseudo-labeling scheme to achieve a more accurate labeling of web data that also consider classes being learned in the current step. Experimental results show that this enhanced approach achieves remarkable results, especially when multiple incremental learning steps are performed.

- **Summary**: Existing nighttime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trackers follow an "Enhance-then-Track" architecture - first using a light enhancer to brighten the nighttime video, then employing a daytime tracker to locate the object. This separate enhancement and tracking fails to build an end-to-end trainable vision system. To address this, we propose a novel architecture called Darkness Clue-Prompted Tracking (DCPT) that achieves robust UAV tracking at night by efficiently learning to generate darkness clue prompts. Without a separate enhancer, DCPT directly encodes anti-dark capabilities into prompts using a darkness clue prompter (DCP). Specifically, DCP iteratively learns emphasizing and undermining projections for darkness clues. It then injects these learned visual prompts into a daytime tracker with fixed parameters across transformer layers. Moreover, a gated feature aggregation mechanism enables adaptive fusion between prompts and between prompts and the base model. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance for DCPT on multiple dark scenario benchmarks. The unified end-to-end learning of enhancement and tracking in DCPT enables a more trainable system. The darkness clue prompting efficiently injects anti-dark knowledge without extra modules. Code and models will be released.

- **Summary**: In this work, we develop an unsupervised method for the joint segmentation and denoising of a single image. To this end, we combine the advantages of a variational segmentation method with the power of a self-supervised, single-image based deep learning approach. One major strength of our method lies in the fact, that in contrast to data-driven methods, where huge amounts of labeled samples are necessary, our model can segment an image into multiple meaningful regions without any training database. Further, we introduce a novel energy functional in which denoising and segmentation are coupled in a way that both tasks benefit from each other. The limitations of existing single-image based variational segmentation methods, which are not capable of dealing with high noise or generic texture, are tackled by this specific combination with self-supervised image denoising. We propose a unified optimisation strategy and show that, especially for very noisy images available in microscopy, our proposed joint approach outperforms its sequential counterpart as well as alternative methods focused purely on denoising or segmentation. Another comparison is conducted with a supervised deep learning approach designed for the same application, highlighting the good performance of our approach.

- **Summary**: Instance segmentation has witnessed promising advancements through deep neural network-based algorithms. However, these models often exhibit incorrect predictions with unwarranted confidence levels. Consequently, evaluating prediction uncertainty becomes critical for informed decision-making. Existing methods primarily focus on quantifying uncertainty in classification or regression tasks, lacking emphasis on instance segmentation. Our research addresses the challenge of estimating spatial certainty associated with the location of instances with star-convex shapes. Two distinct clustering approaches are evaluated which compute spatial and fractional certainty per instance employing samples by the Monte-Carlo Dropout or Deep Ensemble technique. Our study demonstrates that combining spatial and fractional certainty scores yields improved calibrated estimation over individual certainty scores. Notably, our experimental results show that the Deep Ensemble technique alongside our novel radial clustering approach proves to be an effective strategy. Our findings emphasize the significance of evaluating the calibration of estimated certainties for model reliability and decision-making.

- **Summary**: We study a challenging problem of unsupervised discovery of object landmarks. Many recent methods rely on bottlenecks to generate 2D Gaussian heatmaps however, these are limited in generating informed heatmaps while training, presumably due to the lack of effective structural cues. Also, it is assumed that all predicted landmarks are semantically relevant despite having no ground truth supervision. In the current work, we introduce a consistency-guided bottleneck in an image reconstruction-based pipeline that leverages landmark consistency, a measure of compatibility score with the pseudo-ground truth to generate adaptive heatmaps. We propose obtaining pseudo-supervision via forming landmark correspondence across images. The consistency then modulates the uncertainty of the discovered landmarks in the generation of adaptive heatmaps which rank consistent landmarks above their noisy counterparts, providing effective structural information for improved robustness. Evaluations on five diverse datasets including MAFL, AFLW, LS3D, Cats, and Shoes demonstrate excellent performance of the proposed approach compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is an essential technology for self-driving cars to comprehend their surroundings. Currently, real-time semantic segmentation networks commonly employ either encoder-decoder architecture or two-pathway architecture. Generally speaking, encoder-decoder models tend to be quicker,whereas two-pathway models exhibit higher accuracy. To leverage both strengths, we present the Spatial-Assistant Encoder-Decoder Network (SANet) to fuse the two architectures. In the overall architecture, we uphold the encoder-decoder design while maintaining the feature maps in the middle section of the encoder and utilizing atrous convolution branches for same-resolution feature extraction. Toward the end of the encoder, we integrate the asymmetric pooling pyramid pooling module (APPPM) to optimize the semantic extraction of the feature maps. This module incorporates asymmetric pooling layers that extract features at multiple resolutions. In the decoder, we present a hybrid attention module, SAD, that integrates horizontal and vertical attention to facilitate the combination of various branches. To ascertain the effectiveness of our approach, our SANet model achieved competitive results on the real-time CamVid and cityscape datasets. By employing a single 2080Ti GPU, SANet achieved a 78.4 % mIOU at 65.1 FPS on the Cityscape test dataset and 78.8 % mIOU at 147 FPS on the CamVid test dataset. The training code and model for SANet are available at https://github.com/CuZaoo/SANet-main

- **Summary**: Visible and near-infrared(NIR) band sensors provide images that capture complementary spectral radiations from a scene. And the fusion of the visible and NIR image aims at utilizing their spectrum properties to enhance image quality. However, currently visible and NIR fusion algorithms cannot well take advantage of spectrum properties, as well as lack information complementarity, which results in color distortion and artifacts. Therefore, this paper designs a complementary fusion model from the level of physical signals. First, in order to distinguish between noise and useful information, we use two layers of the weight-guided filter and guided filter to obtain texture and edge layers, respectively. Second, to generate the initial visible-NIR complementarity weight map, the difference maps of visible and NIR are filtered by the extend-DoG filter. After that, the significant region of NIR night-time compensation guides the initial complementarity weight map by the arctanI function. Finally, the fusion images can be generated by the complementarity weight maps of visible and NIR images, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can not only well take advantage of the spectrum properties and the information complementarity, but also avoid color unnatural while maintaining naturalness, which outperforms the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Precise polyp segmentation is vital for the early diagnosis and prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) in clinical practice. However, due to scale variation and blurry polyp boundaries, it is still a challenging task to achieve satisfactory segmentation performance with different scales and shapes. In this study, we present a novel Edge-aware Feature Aggregation Network (EFA-Net) for polyp segmentation, which can fully make use of cross-level and multi-scale features to enhance the performance of polyp segmentation. Specifically, we first present an Edge-aware Guidance Module (EGM) to combine the low-level features with the high-level features to learn an edge-enhanced feature, which is incorporated into each decoder unit using a layer-by-layer strategy. Besides, a Scale-aware Convolution Module (SCM) is proposed to learn scale-aware features by using dilated convolutions with different ratios, in order to effectively deal with scale variation. Further, a Cross-level Fusion Module (CFM) is proposed to effectively integrate the cross-level features, which can exploit the local and global contextual information. Finally, the outputs of CFMs are adaptively weighted by using the learned edge-aware feature, which are then used to produce multiple side-out segmentation maps. Experimental results on five widely adopted colonoscopy datasets show that our EFA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art polyp segmentation methods in terms of generalization and effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds for perception tasks including 3D object detection and LiDAR semantic segmentation is notoriously time-and-energy-consuming. To alleviate the burden from labeling, it is promising to perform large-scale pre-training and fine-tune the pre-trained backbone on different downstream datasets as well as tasks. In this paper, we propose SPOT, namely Scalable Pre-training via Occupancy prediction for learning Transferable 3D representations, and demonstrate its effectiveness on various public datasets with different downstream tasks under the label-efficiency setting. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Occupancy prediction is shown to be promising for learning general representations, which is demonstrated by extensive experiments on plenty of datasets and tasks. (2) SPOT uses beam re-sampling technique for point cloud augmentation and applies class-balancing strategies to overcome the domain gap brought by various LiDAR sensors and annotation strategies in different datasets. (3) Scalable pre-training is observed, that is, the downstream performance across all the experiments gets better with more pre-training data. We believe that our findings can facilitate understanding of LiDAR point clouds and pave the way for future exploration in LiDAR pre-training. Codes and models will be released.



### Retinex-guided Channel-grouping based Patch Swap for Arbitrary Style Transfer

- **Summary**: The basic principle of the patch-matching based style transfer is to substitute the patches of the content image feature maps by the closest patches from the style image feature maps. Since the finite features harvested from one single aesthetic style image are inadequate to represent the rich textures of the content natural image, existing techniques treat the full-channel style feature patches as simple signal tensors and create new style feature patches via signal-level fusion, which ignore the implicit diversities existed in style features and thus fail for generating better stylised results. In this paper, we propose a Retinex theory guided, channel-grouping based patch swap technique to solve the above challenges. Channel-grouping strategy groups the style feature maps into surface and texture channels, which prevents the winner-takes-all problem. Retinex theory based decomposition controls a more stable channel code rate generation. In addition, we provide complementary fusion and multi-scale generation strategy to prevent unexpected black area and over-stylised results respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing techniques in providing more style-consistent textures while keeping the content fidelity.

- **Summary**: The curve-based lane representation is a popular approach in many lane detection methods, as it allows for the representation of lanes as a whole object and maximizes the use of holistic information about the lanes. However, the curves produced by these methods may not fit well with irregular lines, which can lead to gaps in performance compared to indirect representations such as segmentation-based or point-based methods. We have observed that these lanes are not intended to be irregular, but they appear zigzagged in the perspective view due to being drawn on uneven pavement. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the lane detection task by decomposing it into two parts: curve modeling and ground height regression. Specifically, we use a parameterized curve to represent lanes in the BEV space to reflect the original distribution of lanes. For the second part, since ground heights are determined by natural factors such as road conditions and are less holistic, we regress the ground heights of key points separately from the curve modeling. Additionally, we have unified the 2D and 3D lane detection tasks by designing a new framework and a series of losses to guide the optimization of models with or without 3D lane labels. Our experiments on 2D lane detection benchmarks (TuSimple and CULane), as well as the recently proposed 3D lane detection datasets (ONCE-3Dlane and OpenLane), have shown significant improvements. We will make our well-documented source code publicly available.

- **Summary**: Computer Vision and 3D printing have rapidly evolved in the last 10 years but interactions among them have been very limited so far, despite the fact that they share several mathematical techniques. We try to fill the gap presenting an overview of some techniques for Shape-from-Shading problems as well as for 3D printing with an emphasis on the approaches based on nonlinear partial differential equations and optimization. We also sketch possible couplings to complete the process of object manufacturing starting from one or more images of the object and ending with its final 3D print. We will give some practical examples of this procedure.

- **Summary**: Text guided image editing on real images given only the image and the target text prompt as inputs, is a very general and challenging problem, which requires the editing model to reason by itself which part of the image should be edited, to preserve the characteristics of original image, and also to perform complicated non-rigid editing. Previous fine-tuning based solutions are time-consuming and vulnerable to overfitting, limiting their editing capabilities. To tackle these issues, we design a novel text guided image editing method, Forgedit. First, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework which learns to reconstruct the given image in less than one minute by vision language joint learning. Then we introduce vector subtraction and vector projection to explore the proper text embedding for editing. We also find a general property of UNet structures in Diffusion Models and inspired by such a finding, we design forgetting strategies to diminish the fatal overfitting issues and significantly boost the editing abilities of Diffusion Models. Our method, Forgedit, implemented with Stable Diffusion, achieves new state-of-the-art results on the challenging text guided image editing benchmark TEdBench, surpassing the previous SOTA method Imagic with Imagen, in terms of both CLIP score and LPIPS score. Codes are available at https://github.com/witcherofresearch/Forgedit.

- **Summary**: Introduction: Covert tobacco advertisements often raise regulatory measures. This paper presents that artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, has great potential for detecting hidden advertising and allows unbiased, reproducible, and fair quantification of tobacco-related media content. Methods: We propose an integrated text and image processing model based on deep learning, generative methods, and human reinforcement, which can detect smoking cases in both textual and visual formats, even with little available training data. Results: Our model can achieve 74\% accuracy for images and 98\% for text. Furthermore, our system integrates the possibility of expert intervention in the form of human reinforcement. Conclusions: Using the pre-trained multimodal, image, and text processing models available through deep learning makes it possible to detect smoking in different media even with few training data.

- **Summary**: Machine-learning models can be fooled by adversarial examples, i.e., carefully-crafted input perturbations that force models to output wrong predictions. While uncertainty quantification has been recently proposed to detect adversarial inputs, under the assumption that such attacks exhibit a higher prediction uncertainty than pristine data, it has been shown that adaptive attacks specifically aimed at reducing also the uncertainty estimate can easily bypass this defense mechanism. In this work, we focus on a different adversarial scenario in which the attacker is still interested in manipulating the uncertainty estimate, but regardless of the correctness of the prediction; in particular, the goal is to undermine the use of machine-learning models when their outputs are consumed by a downstream module or by a human operator. Following such direction, we: \textit{(i)} design a threat model for attacks targeting uncertainty quantification; \textit{(ii)} devise different attack strategies on conceptually different UQ techniques spanning for both classification and semantic segmentation problems; \textit{(iii)} conduct a first complete and extensive analysis to compare the differences between some of the most employed UQ approaches under attack. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that our attacks are more effective in manipulating uncertainty quantification measures than attacks aimed to also induce misclassifications.

- **Summary**: Object detection is an essential and fundamental task in computer vision and satellite image processing. Existing deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance thanks to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets. Yet, in real-world applications the availability of labels is limited. In this context, few-shot object detection (FSOD) has emerged as a promising direction, which aims at enabling the model to detect novel objects with only few of them annotated. However, many existing FSOD algorithms overlook a critical issue: when an input image contains multiple novel objects and only a subset of them are annotated, the unlabeled objects will be considered as background during training. This can cause confusions and severely impact the model's ability to recall novel objects. To address this issue, we propose a self-training-based FSOD (ST-FSOD) approach, which incorporates the self-training mechanism into the few-shot fine-tuning process. ST-FSOD aims to enable the discovery of novel objects that are not annotated, and take them into account during training. On the one hand, we devise a two-branch region proposal networks (RPN) to separate the proposal extraction of base and novel objects, On another hand, we incorporate the student-teacher mechanism into RPN and the region of interest (RoI) head to include those highly confident yet unlabeled targets as pseudo labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in various FSOD settings by a large margin. The codes will be publicly available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/ST-FSOD.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation has drawn widespread attention from the vision community due to its broad applications. In this paper, we propose a novel physics (geometry)-driven deep learning framework for monocular depth estimation by assuming that 3D scenes are constituted by piece-wise planes. Particularly, we introduce a new normal-distance head that outputs pixel-level surface normal and plane-to-origin distance for deriving depth at each position. Meanwhile, the normal and distance are regularized by a developed plane-aware consistency constraint. We further integrate an additional depth head to improve the robustness of the proposed framework. To fully exploit the strengths of these two heads, we develop an effective contrastive iterative refinement module that refines depth in a complementary manner according to the depth uncertainty. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method exceeds previous state-of-the-art competitors on the NYU-Depth-v2, KITTI and SUN RGB-D datasets. Notably, it ranks 1st among all submissions on the KITTI depth prediction online benchmark at the submission time.

- **Summary**: Marine debris poses a significant threat to the survival of marine wildlife, often leading to entanglement and starvation, ultimately resulting in death. Therefore, removing debris from the ocean is crucial to restore the natural balance and allow marine life to thrive. Instance segmentation is an advanced form of object detection that identifies objects and precisely locates and separates them, making it an essential tool for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to navigate and interact with their underwater environment effectively. AUVs use image segmentation to analyze images captured by their cameras to navigate underwater environments. In this paper, we use instance segmentation to calculate the area of individual objects within an image, we use YOLOV7 in Roboflow to generate a set of bounding boxes for each object in the image with a class label and a confidence score for every detection. A segmentation mask is then created for each object by applying a binary mask to the object's bounding box. The masks are generated by applying a binary threshold to the output of a convolutional neural network trained to segment objects from the background. Finally, refining the segmentation mask for each object is done by applying post-processing techniques such as morphological operations and contour detection, to improve the accuracy and quality of the mask. The process of estimating the area of instance segmentation involves calculating the area of each segmented instance separately and then summing up the areas of all instances to obtain the total area. The calculation is carried out using standard formulas based on the shape of the object, such as rectangles and circles. In cases where the object is complex, the Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the area. This method provides a higher degree of accuracy than traditional methods, especially when using a large number of samples.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptation (DA) has been widely applied in the diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading of unannotated ultra-wide-field (UWF) fundus images, which can transfer annotated knowledge from labeled color fundus images. However, suffering from huge domain gaps and complex real-world scenarios, the DR grading performance of most mainstream DA is far from that of clinical diagnosis. To tackle this, we propose a novel source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) in this paper. Specifically, we focus on DR grading problem itself and propose to generate features of color fundus images with continuously evolving relationships of DRs, actively select a few valuable UWF fundus images for labeling with local representation matching, and adapt model on UWF fundus images with DR lesion prototypes. Notably, the SFADA also takes data privacy and computational efficiency into consideration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SFADA achieves state-of-the-art DR grading performance, increasing accuracy by 20.9% and quadratic weighted kappa by 18.63% compared with baseline and reaching 85.36% and 92.38% respectively. These investigations show that the potential of our approach for real clinical practice is promising.

- **Summary**: In this work, we explore the influence of entropy change in deep learning systems by adding noise to the inputs/latent features. The applications in this paper focus on deep learning tasks within computer vision, but the proposed theory can be further applied to other fields. Noise is conventionally viewed as a harmful perturbation in various deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), as well as different learning tasks like image classification and transfer learning. However, this paper aims to rethink whether the conventional proposition always holds. We demonstrate that specific noise can boost the performance of various deep architectures under certain conditions. We theoretically prove the enhancement gained from positive noise by reducing the task complexity defined by information entropy and experimentally show the significant performance gain in large image datasets, such as the ImageNet. Herein, we use the information entropy to define the complexity of the task. We categorize the noise into two types, positive noise (PN) and harmful noise (HN), based on whether the noise can help reduce the complexity of the task. Extensive experiments of CNNs and ViTs have shown performance improvements by proactively injecting positive noise, where we achieved an unprecedented top 1 accuracy of over 95% on ImageNet. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence have confirmed that the presence of positive noise can benefit the learning process, while the traditionally perceived harmful noise indeed impairs deep learning models. The different roles of noise offer new explanations for deep models on specific tasks and provide a new paradigm for improving model performance. Moreover, it reminds us that we can influence the performance of learning systems via information entropy change.

- **Summary**: Kinship verification is an emerging task in computer vision with multiple potential applications. However, there's no large enough kinship dataset to train a representative and robust model, which is a limitation for achieving better performance. Moreover, face verification is known to exhibit bias, which has not been dealt with by previous kinship verification works and sometimes even results in serious issues. So we first combine existing kinship datasets and label each identity with the correct race in order to take race information into consideration and provide a larger and complete dataset, called KinRace dataset. Secondly, we propose a multi-task learning model structure with attention module to enhance accuracy, which surpasses state-of-the-art performance. Lastly, our fairness-aware contrastive loss function with adversarial learning greatly mitigates racial bias. We introduce a debias term into traditional contrastive loss and implement gradient reverse in race classification task, which is an innovative idea to mix two fairness methods to alleviate bias. Exhaustive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed KFC in both standard deviation and accuracy at the same time.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional electron microscopy (3DEM) is an essential technique to investigate volumetric tissue ultra-structure. Due to technical limitations and high imaging costs, samples are often imaged anisotropically, where resolution in the axial direction ($z$) is lower than in the lateral directions $(x,y)$. This anisotropy 3DEM can hamper subsequent analysis and visualization tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel deep-learning (DL)-based self-supervised super-resolution approach that computationally reconstructs isotropic 3DEM from the anisotropic acquisition. The proposed DL-based framework is built upon the U-shape architecture incorporating vision-transformer (ViT) blocks, enabling high-capability learning of local and global multi-scale image dependencies. To train the tailored network, we employ a self-supervised approach. Specifically, we generate pairs of anisotropic and isotropic training datasets from the given anisotropic 3DEM data. By feeding the given anisotropic 3DEM dataset in the trained network through our proposed framework, the isotropic 3DEM is obtained. Importantly, this isotropic reconstruction approach relies solely on the given anisotropic 3DEM dataset and does not require pairs of co-registered anisotropic and isotropic 3DEM training datasets. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments using three 3DEM datasets acquired from brain. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed framework could successfully reconstruct isotropic 3DEM from the anisotropic acquisition.

- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art point cloud-based perception methods usually rely on large-scale labeled data, which requires expensive manual annotations. A natural option is to explore the unsupervised methodology for 3D perception tasks. However, such methods often face substantial performance-drop difficulties. Fortunately, we found that there exist amounts of image-based datasets and an alternative can be proposed, i.e., transferring the knowledge in the 2D images to 3D point clouds. Specifically, we propose a novel approach for the challenging cross-modal and cross-domain adaptation task by fully exploring the relationship between images and point clouds and designing effective feature alignment strategies. Without any 3D labels, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation on SemanticKITTI by using the knowledge of KITTI360 and GTA5, compared to existing unsupervised and weakly-supervised baselines.

- **Summary**: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) present a challenging computer vision task due to their gigapixel size and presence of numerous artefacts. Yet they are a valuable resource for patient diagnosis and stratification, often representing the gold standard for diagnostic tasks. Real-world clinical datasets tend to come as sets of heterogeneous WSIs with labels present at the patient-level, with poor to no annotations. Weakly supervised attention-based multiple instance learning approaches have been developed in recent years to address these challenges, but can fail to resolve both long and short-range dependencies. Here we propose an end-to-end multi-stain self-attention graph (MUSTANG) multiple instance learning pipeline, which is designed to solve a weakly-supervised gigapixel multi-image classification task, where the label is assigned at the patient-level, but no slide-level labels or region annotations are available. The pipeline uses a self-attention based approach by restricting the operations to a highly sparse k-Nearest Neighbour Graph of embedded WSI patches based on the Euclidean distance. We show this approach achieves a state-of-the-art F1-score/AUC of 0.89/0.92, outperforming the widely used CLAM model. Our approach is highly modular and can easily be modified to suit different clinical datasets, as it only requires a patient-level label without annotations and accepts WSI sets of different sizes, as the graphs can be of varying sizes and structures.

- **Summary**: We focus on the task of soundscape mapping, which involves predicting the most probable sounds that could be perceived at a particular geographic location. We utilise recent state-of-the-art models to encode geotagged audio, a textual description of the audio, and an overhead image of its capture location using contrastive pre-training. The end result is a shared embedding space for the three modalities, which enables the construction of soundscape maps for any geographic region from textual or audio queries. Using the SoundingEarth dataset, we find that our approach significantly outperforms the existing SOTA, with an improvement of image-to-audio Recall@100 from 0.256 to 0.450.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in applying stylization on 3D scenes from a reference style image, in particular onto neural radiance fields (NeRF). While performing stylization directly on NeRF guarantees appearance consistency over arbitrary novel views, it is a challenging problem to guide the transfer of patterns from the style image onto different parts of the NeRF scene. In this work, we propose a stylization framework for NeRF based on local style transfer. In particular, we use a hash-grid encoding to learn the embedding of the appearance and geometry components, and show that the mapping defined by the hash table allows us to control the stylization to a certain extent. Stylization is then achieved by optimizing the appearance branch while keeping the geometry branch fixed. To support local style transfer, we propose a new loss function that utilizes a segmentation network and bipartite matching to establish region correspondences between the style image and the content images obtained from volume rendering. Our experiments show that our method yields plausible stylization results with novel view synthesis while having flexible controllability via manipulating and customizing the region correspondences.

- **Summary**: In recent years, novel view synthesis from a single image has seen significant progress thanks to the rapid advancements in 3D scene representation and image inpainting techniques. While the current approaches are able to synthesize geometrically consistent novel views, they often do not handle the view-dependent effects properly. Specifically, the highlights in their synthesized images usually appear to be glued to the surfaces, making the novel views unrealistic. To address this major problem, we make a key observation that the process of synthesizing novel views requires changing the shading of the pixels based on the novel camera, and moving them to appropriate locations. Therefore, we propose to split the view synthesis process into two independent tasks of pixel reshading and relocation. During the reshading process, we take the single image as the input and adjust its shading based on the novel camera. This reshaded image is then used as the input to an existing view synthesis method to relocate the pixels and produce the final novel view image. We propose to use a neural network to perform reshading and generate a large set of synthetic input-reshaded pairs to train our network. We demonstrate that our approach produces plausible novel view images with realistic moving highlights on a variety of real world scenes.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained open-set recognition (FineOSR) aims to recognize images belonging to classes with subtle appearance differences while rejecting images of unknown classes. A recent trend in OSR shows the benefit of generative models to discriminative unknown detection. As a type of generative model, energy-based models (EBM) are the potential for hybrid modeling of generative and discriminative tasks. However, most existing EBMs suffer from density estimation in high-dimensional space, which is critical to recognizing images from fine-grained classes. In this paper, we explore the low-dimensional latent space with energy-based prior distribution for OSR in a fine-grained visual world. Specifically, based on the latent space EBM, we propose an attribute-aware information bottleneck (AIB), a residual attribute feature aggregation (RAFA) module, and an uncertainty-based virtual outlier synthesis (UVOS) module to improve the expressivity, granularity, and density of the samples in fine-grained classes, respectively. Our method is flexible to take advantage of recent vision transformers for powerful visual classification and generation. The method is validated on both fine-grained and general visual classification datasets while preserving the capability of generating photo-realistic fake images with high resolution.



### Interpret Vision Transformers as ConvNets with Dynamic Convolutions

- **Summary**: There has been a debate about the superiority between vision Transformers and ConvNets, serving as the backbone of computer vision models. Although they are usually considered as two completely different architectures, in this paper, we interpret vision Transformers as ConvNets with dynamic convolutions, which enables us to characterize existing Transformers and dynamic ConvNets in a unified framework and compare their design choices side by side. In addition, our interpretation can also guide the network design as researchers now can consider vision Transformers from the design space of ConvNets and vice versa. We demonstrate such potential through two specific studies. First, we inspect the role of softmax in vision Transformers as the activation function and find it can be replaced by commonly used ConvNets modules, such as ReLU and Layer Normalization, which results in a faster convergence rate and better performance. Second, following the design of depth-wise convolution, we create a corresponding depth-wise vision Transformer that is more efficient with comparable performance. The potential of the proposed unified interpretation is not limited to the given examples and we hope it can inspire the community and give rise to more advanced network architectures.

- **Summary**: Image denoising is a fundamental and challenging task in the field of computer vision. Most supervised denoising methods learn to reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs, which have intrinsic spectral bias and tend to produce over-smoothed and blurry images. Recently, researchers have explored diffusion models to generate high-frequency details in image restoration tasks, but these models do not guarantee that the generated texture aligns with real images, leading to undesirable artifacts. To address the trade-off between visual appeal and fidelity of high-frequency details in denoising tasks, we propose a novel approach called the Reconstruct-and-Generate Diffusion Model (RnG). Our method leverages a reconstructive denoising network to recover the majority of the underlying clean signal, which serves as the initial estimation for subsequent steps to maintain fidelity. Additionally, it employs a diffusion algorithm to generate residual high-frequency details, thereby enhancing visual quality. We further introduce a two-stage training scheme to ensure effective collaboration between the reconstructive and generative modules of RnG. To reduce undesirable texture introduced by the diffusion model, we also propose an adaptive step controller that regulates the number of inverse steps applied by the diffusion model, allowing control over the level of high-frequency details added to each patch as well as saving the inference computational cost. Through our proposed RnG, we achieve a better balance between perception and distortion. We conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real denoising datasets, validating the superiority of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Humans can easily perceive the direction of sound sources in a visual scene, termed sound source localization. Recent studies on learning-based sound source localization have mainly explored the problem from a localization perspective. However, prior arts and existing benchmarks do not account for a more important aspect of the problem, cross-modal semantic understanding, which is essential for genuine sound source localization. Cross-modal semantic understanding is important in understanding semantically mismatched audio-visual events, e.g., silent objects, or off-screen sounds. To account for this, we propose a cross-modal alignment task as a joint task with sound source localization to better learn the interaction between audio and visual modalities. Thereby, we achieve high localization performance with strong cross-modal semantic understanding. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in both sound source localization and cross-modal retrieval. Our work suggests that jointly tackling both tasks is necessary to conquer genuine sound source localization.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel method to automatically classify medical images that learns and leverages weak causal signals in the image. Our framework consists of a convolutional neural network backbone and a causality-extractor module that extracts cause-effect relationships between feature maps that can inform the model on the appearance of a feature in one place of the image, given the presence of another feature within some other place of the image. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in low-data scenarios, we train our causality-driven architecture in a One-shot learning scheme, where we propose a new meta-learning procedure entailing meta-training and meta-testing tasks that are designed using related classes but at different levels of granularity. We conduct binary and multi-class classification experiments on a publicly available dataset of prostate MRI images. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed causality-driven module, we perform an ablation study and conduct qualitative assessments using class activation maps to highlight regions strongly influencing the network's decision-making process. Our findings show that causal relationships among features play a crucial role in enhancing the model's ability to discern relevant information and yielding more reliable and interpretable predictions. This would make it a promising approach for medical image classification tasks.

- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art methods for panoptic segmentation require an immense amount of annotated training data that is both arduous and expensive to obtain posing a significant challenge for their widespread adoption. Concurrently, recent breakthroughs in visual representation learning have sparked a paradigm shift leading to the advent of large foundation models that can be trained with completely unlabeled images. In this work, we propose to leverage such task-agnostic image features to enable few-shot panoptic segmentation by presenting Segmenting Panoptic Information with Nearly 0 labels (SPINO). In detail, our method combines a DINOv2 backbone with lightweight network heads for semantic segmentation and boundary estimation. We show that our approach, albeit being trained with only ten annotated images, predicts high-quality pseudo-labels that can be used with any existing panoptic segmentation method. Notably, we demonstrate that SPINO achieves competitive results compared to fully supervised baselines while using less than 0.3% of the ground truth labels, paving the way for learning complex visual recognition tasks leveraging foundation models. To illustrate its general applicability, we further deploy SPINO on real-world robotic vision systems for both outdoor and indoor environments. To foster future research, we make the code and trained models publicly available at http://spino.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

- **Summary**: Recent hand-object interaction datasets show limited real object variability and rely on fitting the MANO parametric model to obtain groundtruth hand shapes. To go beyond these limitations and spur further research, we introduce the SHOWMe dataset which consists of 96 videos, annotated with real and detailed hand-object 3D textured meshes. Following recent work, we consider a rigid hand-object scenario, in which the pose of the hand with respect to the object remains constant during the whole video sequence. This assumption allows us to register sub-millimetre-precise groundtruth 3D scans to the image sequences in SHOWMe. Although simpler, this hypothesis makes sense in terms of applications where the required accuracy and level of detail is important eg., object hand-over in human-robot collaboration, object scanning, or manipulation and contact point analysis. Importantly, the rigidity of the hand-object systems allows to tackle video-based 3D reconstruction of unknown hand-held objects using a 2-stage pipeline consisting of a rigid registration step followed by a multi-view reconstruction (MVR) part. We carefully evaluate a set of non-trivial baselines for these two stages and show that it is possible to achieve promising object-agnostic 3D hand-object reconstructions employing an SfM toolbox or a hand pose estimator to recover the rigid transforms and off-the-shelf MVR algorithms. However, these methods remain sensitive to the initial camera pose estimates which might be imprecise due to lack of textures on the objects or heavy occlusions of the hands, leaving room for improvements in the reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Bodily behavioral language is an important social cue, and its automated analysis helps in enhancing the understanding of artificial intelligence systems. Furthermore, behavioral language cues are essential for active engagement in social agent-based user interactions. Despite the progress made in computer vision for tasks like head and body pose estimation, there is still a need to explore the detection of finer behaviors such as gesturing, grooming, or fumbling. This paper proposes a multiview attention fusion method named MAGIC-TBR that combines features extracted from videos and their corresponding Discrete Cosine Transform coefficients via a transformer-based approach. The experiments are conducted on the BBSI dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature fusion with multiview attention.

- **Summary**: Despite an exciting new wave of multimodal machine learning models, current approaches still struggle to interpret the complex contextual relationships between the different modalities present in videos. Going beyond existing methods that emphasize simple activities or objects, we propose a new model-agnostic approach for generating detailed textual descriptions that captures multimodal video information. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge learnt by large language models, such as GPT-3.5 or Llama2, to reason about textual descriptions of the visual and aural modalities, obtained from BLIP-2, Whisper and ImageBind. Without needing additional finetuning of video-text models or datasets, we demonstrate that available LLMs have the ability to use these multimodal textual descriptions as proxies for ``sight'' or ``hearing'' and perform zero-shot multimodal classification of videos in-context. Our evaluations on popular action recognition benchmarks, such as UCF-101 or Kinetics, show these context-rich descriptions can be successfully used in video understanding tasks. This method points towards a promising new research direction in multimodal classification, demonstrating how an interplay between textual, visual and auditory machine learning models can enable more holistic video understanding.

- **Summary**: NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission collects large data volumes of the Sun's daily activity. Data compression is crucial for space missions to reduce data storage and video bandwidth requirements by eliminating redundancies in the data. In this paper, we present a novel neural Transformer-based video compression approach specifically designed for the SDO images. Our primary objective is to efficiently exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies inherent in solar images to obtain a high compression ratio. Our proposed architecture benefits from a novel Transformer block called Fused Local-aware Window (FLaWin), which incorporates window-based self-attention modules and an efficient fused local-aware feed-forward (FLaFF) network. This architectural design allows us to simultaneously capture short-range and long-range information while facilitating the extraction of rich and diverse contextual representations. Moreover, this design choice results in reduced computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the significant contribution of the FLaWin Transformer block to the compression performance, outperforming conventional hand-engineered video codecs such as H.264 and H.265 in terms of rate-distortion trade-off.

- **Summary**: Audio-visual representation learning aims to develop systems with human-like perception by utilizing correlation between auditory and visual information. However, current models often focus on a limited set of tasks, and generalization abilities of learned representations are unclear. To this end, we propose the AV-SUPERB benchmark that enables general-purpose evaluation of unimodal audio/visual and bimodal fusion representations on 7 datasets covering 5 audio-visual tasks in speech and audio processing. We evaluate 5 recent self-supervised models and show that none of these models generalize to all tasks, emphasizing the need for future study on improving universal model performance. In addition, we show that representations may be improved with intermediate-task fine-tuning and audio event classification with AudioSet serves as a strong intermediate task. We release our benchmark with evaluation code and a model submission platform to encourage further research in audio-visual learning.

- **Summary**: Developing an agent capable of adapting to unseen environments remains a difficult challenge in imitation learning. In this work, we present Adaptive Return-conditioned Policy (ARP), an efficient framework designed to enhance the agent's generalization ability using natural language task descriptions and pre-trained multimodal encoders. Our key idea is to calculate a similarity between visual observations and natural language instructions in the pre-trained multimodal embedding space (such as CLIP) and use it as a reward signal. We then train a return-conditioned policy using expert demonstrations labeled with multimodal rewards. Because the multimodal rewards provide adaptive signals at each timestep, our ARP effectively mitigates the goal misgeneralization. This results in superior generalization performances even when faced with unseen text instructions, compared to existing text-conditioned policies. To improve the quality of rewards, we also introduce a fine-tuning method for pre-trained multimodal encoders, further enhancing the performance.

- **Summary**: Missions studying the dynamic behaviour of the Sun are defined to capture multi-spectral images of the sun and transmit them to the ground station in a daily basis. To make transmission efficient and feasible, image compression systems need to be exploited. Recently successful end-to-end optimized neural network-based image compression systems have shown great potential to be used in an ad-hoc manner. In this work we have proposed a transformer-based multi-spectral neural image compressor to efficiently capture redundancies both intra/inter-wavelength. To unleash the locality of window-based self attention mechanism, we propose an inter-window aggregated token multi head self attention. Additionally to make the neural compressor autoencoder shift invariant, a randomly shifted window attention mechanism is used which makes the transformer blocks insensitive to translations in their input domain. We demonstrate that the proposed approach not only outperforms the conventional compression algorithms but also it is able to better decorrelates images along the multiple wavelengths compared to single spectral compression.

- **Summary**: Transform and entropy models are the two core components in deep image compression neural networks. Most existing learning-based image compression methods utilize convolutional-based transform, which lacks the ability to model long-range dependencies, primarily due to the limited receptive field of the convolution operation. To address this limitation, we propose a Transformer-based nonlinear transform. This transform has the remarkable ability to efficiently capture both local and global information from the input image, leading to a more decorrelated latent representation. In addition, we introduce a novel entropy model that incorporates two different hyperpriors to model cross-channel and spatial dependencies of the latent representation. To further improve the entropy model, we add a global context that leverages distant relationships to predict the current latent more accurately. This global context employs a causal attention mechanism to extract long-range information in a content-dependent manner. Our experiments show that our proposed framework performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of rate-distortion performance.

- **Summary**: Exploiting pre-trained diffusion models for restoration has recently become a favored alternative to the traditional task-specific training approach. Previous works have achieved noteworthy success by limiting the solution space using explicit degradation models. However, these methods often fall short when faced with complex degradations as they generally cannot be precisely modeled. In this paper, we propose PGDiff by introducing partial guidance, a fresh perspective that is more adaptable to real-world degradations compared to existing works. Rather than specifically defining the degradation process, our approach models the desired properties, such as image structure and color statistics of high-quality images, and applies this guidance during the reverse diffusion process. These properties are readily available and make no assumptions about the degradation process. When combined with a diffusion prior, this partial guidance can deliver appealing results across a range of restoration tasks. Additionally, PGDiff can be extended to handle composite tasks by consolidating multiple high-quality image properties, achieved by integrating the guidance from respective tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing diffusion-prior-based approaches but also competes favorably with task-specific models.

- **Summary**: Training perception systems for self-driving cars requires substantial annotations. However, manual labeling in 2D images is highly labor-intensive. While existing datasets provide rich annotations for pre-recorded sequences, they fall short in labeling rarely encountered viewpoints, potentially hampering the generalization ability for perception models. In this paper, we present PanopticNeRF-360, a novel approach that combines coarse 3D annotations with noisy 2D semantic cues to generate consistent panoptic labels and high-quality images from any viewpoint. Our key insight lies in exploiting the complementarity of 3D and 2D priors to mutually enhance geometry and semantics. Specifically, we propose to leverage noisy semantic and instance labels in both 3D and 2D spaces to guide geometry optimization. Simultaneously, the improved geometry assists in filtering noise present in the 3D and 2D annotations by merging them in 3D space via a learned semantic field. To further enhance appearance, we combine MLP and hash grids to yield hybrid scene features, striking a balance between high-frequency appearance and predominantly contiguous semantics. Our experiments demonstrate PanopticNeRF-360's state-of-the-art performance over existing label transfer methods on the challenging urban scenes of the KITTI-360 dataset. Moreover, PanopticNeRF-360 enables omnidirectional rendering of high-fidelity, multi-view and spatiotemporally consistent appearance, semantic and instance labels.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as a popular family of deep generative models (DGMs). In the literature, it has been claimed that one class of diffusion models -- denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) -- demonstrate superior image synthesis performance as compared to generative adversarial networks (GANs). To date, these claims have been evaluated using either ensemble-based methods designed for natural images, or conventional measures of image quality such as structural similarity. However, there remains an important need to understand the extent to which DDPMs can reliably learn medical imaging domain-relevant information, which is referred to as `spatial context' in this work. To address this, a systematic assessment of the ability of DDPMs to learn spatial context relevant to medical imaging applications is reported for the first time. A key aspect of the studies is the use of stochastic context models (SCMs) to produce training data. In this way, the ability of the DDPMs to reliably reproduce spatial context can be quantitatively assessed by use of post-hoc image analyses. Error-rates in DDPM-generated ensembles are reported, and compared to those corresponding to a modern GAN. The studies reveal new and important insights regarding the capacity of DDPMs to learn spatial context. Notably, the results demonstrate that DDPMs hold significant capacity for generating contextually correct images that are `interpolated' between training samples, which may benefit data-augmentation tasks in ways that GANs cannot.
