- **Summary**: To alleviate the expensive human labeling, semi-supervised semantic segmentation employs a few labeled images and an abundant of unlabeled images to predict the pixel-level label map with the same size. Previous methods often adopt co-training using two convolutional networks with the same architecture but different initialization, which fails to capture the sufficiently diverse features. This motivates us to use tri-training and develop the triple-view encoder to utilize the encoders with different architectures to derive diverse features, and exploit the knowledge distillation skill to learn the complementary semantics among these encoders. Moreover, existing methods simply concatenate the features from both encoder and decoder, resulting in redundant features that require large memory cost. This inspires us to devise a dual-frequency decoder that selects those important features by projecting the features from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, where the dual-frequency channel attention mechanism is introduced to model the feature importance. Therefore, we propose a Triple-view Knowledge Distillation framework, termed TriKD, for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, including the triple-view encoder and the dual-frequency decoder. Extensive experiments were conducted on two benchmarks, \ie, Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, whose results verify the superiority of the proposed method with a good tradeoff between precision and inference speed.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is indispensable for learning models in the wild, where testing distribution typically unknown and different from the training. Recent methods derived from causality have shown great potential in achieving OOD generalization. However, existing methods mainly focus on the invariance property of causes, while largely overlooking the property of \textit{sufficiency} and \textit{necessity} conditions. Namely, a necessary but insufficient cause (feature) is invariant to distribution shift, yet it may not have required accuracy. By contrast, a sufficient yet unnecessary cause (feature) tends to fit specific data well but may have a risk of adapting to a new domain. To capture the information of sufficient and necessary causes, we employ a classical concept, the probability of sufficiency and necessary causes (PNS), which indicates the probability of whether one is the necessary and sufficient cause. To associate PNS with OOD generalization, we propose PNS risk and formulate an algorithm to learn representation with a high PNS value. We theoretically analyze and prove the generalizability of the PNS risk. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The details of the implementation can be found at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ymy4323460/CaSN.

- **Summary**: Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is a significant public health challenge due to its high prevalence and potential for long-term health effects. Despite Computed Tomography (CT) being the standard diagnostic tool for mTBI, it often yields normal results in mTBI patients despite symptomatic evidence. This fact underscores the complexity of accurate diagnosis. In this study, we introduce an interpretable 3D Multi-Modal Residual Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN) for mTBI diagnostic model enhanced with Occlusion Sensitivity Maps (OSM). Our MRCNN model exhibits promising performance in mTBI diagnosis, demonstrating an average accuracy of 82.4%, sensitivity of 82.6%, and specificity of 81.6%, as validated by a five-fold cross-validation process. Notably, in comparison to the CT-based Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) model, the MRCNN shows an improvement of 4.4% in specificity and 9.0% in accuracy. We show that the OSM offers superior data-driven insights into CT images compared to the Grad-CAM approach. These results highlight the efficacy of the proposed multi-modal model in enhancing the diagnostic precision of mTBI.

- **Summary**: Existing research has shown the potential of classifying Alzheimers Disease (AD) from eye-tracking (ET) data with classifiers that rely on task-specific engineered features. In this paper, we investigate whether we can improve on existing results by using a Deep-Learning classifier trained end-to-end on raw ET data. This classifier (VTNet) uses a GRU and a CNN in parallel to leverage both visual (V) and temporal (T) representations of ET data and was previously used to detect user confusion while processing visual displays. A main challenge in applying VTNet to our target AD classification task is that the available ET data sequences are much longer than those used in the previous confusion detection task, pushing the limits of what is manageable by LSTM-based models. We discuss how we address this challenge and show that VTNet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in AD classification, providing encouraging evidence on the generality of this model to make predictions from ET data.

- **Summary**: You Only Look Once (YOLO)-based object detectors have shown remarkable accuracy for automated brain tumor detection. In this paper, we develop a novel BGF-YOLO architecture by incorporating Bi-level Routing Attention (BRA), Generalized feature pyramid networks (GFPN), and Fourth detecting head into YOLOv8. BGF-YOLO contains an attention mechanism to focus more on important features, and feature pyramid networks to enrich feature representation by merging high-level semantic features with spatial details. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of different attention mechanisms and feature fusions, detection head architectures on brain tumor detection accuracy. Experimental results show that BGF-YOLO gives a 4.7% absolute increase of mAP$_{50}$ compared to YOLOv8x, and achieves state-of-the-art on the brain tumor detection dataset Br35H.

- **Summary**: As Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly used in solving various tasks in real-world applications, it is crucial to ensure that ML algorithms are robust to any potential worst-case noises, adversarial attacks, and highly unusual situations when they are designed. Studying ML robustness will significantly help in the design of ML algorithms. In this paper, we investigate ML robustness using adversarial training in centralized and decentralized environments, where ML training and testing are conducted in one or multiple computers. In the centralized environment, we achieve a test accuracy of 65.41% and 83.0% when classifying adversarial examples generated by Fast Gradient Sign Method and DeepFool, respectively. Comparing to existing studies, these results demonstrate an improvement of 18.41% for FGSM and 47% for DeepFool. In the decentralized environment, we study Federated learning (FL) robustness by using adversarial training with independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, respectively, where CIFAR-10 is used in this research. In the IID data case, our experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve such a robust accuracy that it is comparable to the one obtained in the centralized environment. Moreover, in the non-IID data case, the natural accuracy drops from 66.23% to 57.82%, and the robust accuracy decreases by 25% and 23.4% in C&W and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks, compared to the IID data case, respectively. We further propose an IID data-sharing approach, which allows for increasing the natural accuracy to 85.04% and the robust accuracy from 57% to 72% in C&W attacks and from 59% to 67% in PGD attacks.

- **Summary**: Accurate 3D shape abstraction from a single 2D image is a long-standing problem in computer vision and graphics. By leveraging a set of primitives to represent the target shape, recent methods have achieved promising results. However, these methods either use a relatively large number of primitives or lack geometric flexibility due to the limited expressibility of the primitives. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-channel Transformer architecture, integrated with parameterized deformable models, termed DeFormer, to simultaneously estimate the global and local deformations of primitives. In this way, DeFormer can abstract complex object shapes while using a small number of primitives which offer a broader geometry coverage and finer details. Then, we introduce a force-driven dynamic fitting and a cycle-consistent re-projection loss to optimize the primitive parameters. Extensive experiments on ShapeNet across various settings show that DeFormer achieves better reconstruction accuracy over the state-of-the-art, and visualizes with consistent semantic correspondences for improved interpretability.

- **Summary**: Surface defect inspection is an important task in industrial inspection. Deep learning-based methods have demonstrated promising performance in this domain. Nevertheless, these methods still suffer from misjudgment when encountering challenges such as low-contrast defects and complex backgrounds. To overcome these issues, we present a decision fusion network (DFNet) that incorporates the semantic decision with the feature decision to strengthen the decision ability of the network. In particular, we introduce a decision fusion module (DFM) that extracts a semantic vector from the semantic decision branch and a feature vector for the feature decision branch and fuses them to make the final classification decision. In addition, we propose a perception fine-tuning module (PFM) that fine-tunes the foreground and background during the segmentation stage. PFM generates the semantic and feature outputs that are sent to the classification decision stage. Furthermore, we present an inner-outer separation weight matrix to address the impact of label edge uncertainty during segmentation supervision. Our experimental results on the publicly available datasets including KolektorSDD2 (96.1% AP) and Magnetic-tile-defect-datasets (94.6% mAP) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: With the long-term goal of reducing the image processing time on an autonomous mobile robot in mind we explore in this paper the use of log-polar like image data with gaze control. The gaze control is not done on the Cartesian image but on the log-polar like image data. For this we start out from the classic deep reinforcement learning approach for Atari games. We extend an A3C deep RL approach with an LSTM network, and we learn the policy for playing three Atari games and a policy for gaze control. While the Atari games already use low-resolution images of 80 by 80 pixels, we are able to further reduce the amount of image pixels by a factor of 5 without losing any gaming performance.

- **Summary**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) scans have demonstrated effectiveness in combating the rapid spread of the virus. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct research on computerized models for the detection of COVID-19 using CT imaging. A novel processing method has been developed, utilizing radiomic features, to assist in the CT-based diagnosis of COVID-19. Given the lower specificity of traditional features in distinguishing between different causes of pulmonary diseases, the objective of this study is to develop a CT-based radiomics framework for the differentiation of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. The model is designed to focus on outlining COVID-19 lesions, as traditional features often lack specificity in this aspect. The model categorizes images into three classes: COVID-19, non-COVID-19, or normal. It employs enhancement auto-segmentation principles using intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) and deep neural networks (ALS-IDCP-DNN) within a defined range of analysis thresholds. A publicly available dataset comprising COVID-19, normal, and non-COVID-19 classes was utilized to validate the proposed model's effectiveness. The best performing classification model, Residual Neural Network with 50 layers (Resnet-50), attained an average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.8%, 99%, 98%, and 98% respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of our model to accurately classify COVID-19 images, which could aid radiologists in diagnosing suspected COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our model's performance surpasses that of more than 10 current state-of-the-art studies conducted on the same dataset.

- **Summary**: Surface defect inspection is of great importance for industrial manufacture and production. Though defect inspection methods based on deep learning have made significant progress, there are still some challenges for these methods, such as indistinguishable weak defects and defect-like interference in the background. To address these issues, we propose a transformer network with multi-stage CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) feature injection for surface defect segmentation, which is a UNet-like structure named CINFormer. CINFormer presents a simple yet effective feature integration mechanism that injects the multi-level CNN features of the input image into different stages of the transformer network in the encoder. This can maintain the merit of CNN capturing detailed features and that of transformer depressing noises in the background, which facilitates accurate defect detection. In addition, CINFormer presents a Top-K self-attention module to focus on tokens with more important information about the defects, so as to further reduce the impact of the redundant background. Extensive experiments conducted on the surface defect datasets DAGM 2007, Magnetic tile, and NEU show that the proposed CINFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in defect detection.

- **Summary**: Surface defect inspection is a very challenging task in which surface defects usually show weak appearances or exist under complex backgrounds. Most high-accuracy defect detection methods require expensive computation and storage overhead, making them less practical in some resource-constrained defect detection applications. Although some lightweight methods have achieved real-time inference speed with fewer parameters, they show poor detection accuracy in complex defect scenarios. To this end, we develop a Global Context Aggregation Network (GCANet) for lightweight saliency detection of surface defects on the encoder-decoder structure. First, we introduce a novel transformer encoder on the top layer of the lightweight backbone, which captures global context information through a novel Depth-wise Self-Attention (DSA) module. The proposed DSA performs element-wise similarity in channel dimension while maintaining linear complexity. In addition, we introduce a novel Channel Reference Attention (CRA) module before each decoder block to strengthen the representation of multi-level features in the bottom-up path. The proposed CRA exploits the channel correlation between features at different layers to adaptively enhance feature representation. The experimental results on three public defect datasets demonstrate that the proposed network achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and running efficiency compared with other 17 state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, GCANet achieves competitive accuracy (91.79% $F_{\beta}^{w}$, 93.55% $S_\alpha$, and 97.35% $E_\phi$) on SD-saliency-900 while running 272fps on a single gpu.

- **Summary**: The use of Implicit Neural Representation (INR) through a hash-table has demonstrated impressive effectiveness and efficiency in characterizing intricate signals. However, current state-of-the-art methods exhibit insufficient regularization, often yielding unreliable and noisy results during interpolations. We find that this issue stems from broken gradient flow between input coordinates and indexed hash-keys, where the chain rule attempts to model discrete hash-keys, rather than the continuous coordinates. To tackle this concern, we introduce RHINO, in which a continuous analytical function is incorporated to facilitate regularization by connecting the input coordinate and the network additionally without modifying the architecture of current hash-based INRs. This connection ensures a seamless backpropagation of gradients from the network's output back to the input coordinates, thereby enhancing regularization. Our experimental results not only showcase the broadened regularization capability across different hash-based INRs like DINER and Instant NGP, but also across a variety of tasks such as image fitting, representation of signed distance functions, and optimization of 5D static / 6D dynamic neural radiance fields. Notably, RHINO outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both quality and speed, affirming its superiority.

- **Summary**: AI-synthesized text and images have gained significant attention, particularly due to the widespread dissemination of multi-modal manipulations on the internet, which has resulted in numerous negative impacts on society. Existing methods for multi-modal manipulation detection and grounding primarily focus on fusing vision-language features to make predictions, while overlooking the importance of modality-specific features, leading to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we construct a simple and novel transformer-based framework for multi-modal manipulation detection and grounding tasks. Our framework simultaneously explores modality-specific features while preserving the capability for multi-modal alignment. To achieve this, we introduce visual/language pre-trained encoders and dual-branch cross-attention (DCA) to extract and fuse modality-unique features. Furthermore, we design decoupled fine-grained classifiers (DFC) to enhance modality-specific feature mining and mitigate modality competition. Moreover, we propose an implicit manipulation query (IMQ) that adaptively aggregates global contextual cues within each modality using learnable queries, thereby improving the discovery of forged details. Extensive experiments on the $\rm DGM^4$ dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: We introduce the sparse modern Hopfield model as a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model. Like its dense counterpart, the sparse modern Hopfield model equips a memory-retrieval dynamics whose one-step approximation corresponds to the sparse attention mechanism. Theoretically, our key contribution is a principled derivation of a closed-form sparse Hopfield energy using the convex conjugate of the sparse entropic regularizer. Building upon this, we derive the sparse memory retrieval dynamics from the sparse energy function and show its one-step approximation is equivalent to the sparse-structured attention. Importantly, we provide a sparsity-dependent memory retrieval error bound which is provably tighter than its dense analog. The conditions for the benefits of sparsity to arise are therefore identified and discussed. In addition, we show that the sparse modern Hopfield model maintains the robust theoretical properties of its dense counterpart, including rapid fixed point convergence and exponential memory capacity. Empirically, we use both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that the sparse Hopfield model outperforms its dense counterpart in many situations.

- **Summary**: Accurate calibration is crucial for using multiple cameras to triangulate the position of objects precisely. However, it is also a time-consuming process that needs to be repeated for every displacement of the cameras. The standard approach is to use a printed pattern with known geometry to estimate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the cameras. The same idea can be applied to event-based cameras, though it requires extra work. By using frame reconstruction from events, a printed pattern can be detected. A blinking pattern can also be displayed on a screen. Then, the pattern can be directly detected from the events. Such calibration methods can provide accurate intrinsic calibration for both frame- and event-based cameras. However, using 2D patterns has several limitations for multi-camera extrinsic calibration, with cameras possessing highly different points of view and a wide baseline. The 2D pattern can only be detected from one direction and needs to be of significant size to compensate for its distance to the camera. This makes the extrinsic calibration time-consuming and cumbersome. To overcome these limitations, we propose eWand, a new method that uses blinking LEDs inside opaque spheres instead of a printed or displayed pattern. Our method provides a faster, easier-to-use extrinsic calibration approach that maintains high accuracy for both event- and frame-based cameras.

- **Summary**: Most existing methods for unsupervised industrial anomaly detection train a separate model for each object category. This kind of approach can easily capture the category-specific feature distributions, but results in high storage cost and low training efficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified mixed-attention auto encoder (MAAE) to implement multi-class anomaly detection with a single model. To alleviate the performance degradation due to the diverse distribution patterns of different categories, we employ spatial attentions and channel attentions to effectively capture the global category information and model the feature distributions of multiple classes. Furthermore, to simulate the realistic noises on features and preserve the surface semantics of objects from different categories which are essential for detecting the subtle anomalies, we propose an adaptive noise generator and a multi-scale fusion module for the pre-trained features. MAAE delivers remarkable performances on the benchmark dataset compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Noisy multi-label learning has garnered increasing attention due to the challenges posed by collecting large-scale accurate labels, making noisy labels a more practical alternative. Motivated by noisy multi-class learning, the introduction of transition matrices can help model multi-label noise and enable the development of statistically consistent algorithms for noisy multi-label learning. However, estimating multi-label noise transition matrices remains a challenging task, as most existing estimators in noisy multi-class learning rely on anchor points and accurate fitting of noisy class posteriors, which is hard to satisfy in noisy multi-label learning. In this paper, we address this problem by first investigating the identifiability of class-dependent transition matrices in noisy multi-label learning. Building upon the identifiability results, we propose a novel estimator that leverages label correlations without the need for anchor points or precise fitting of noisy class posteriors. Specifically, we first estimate the occurrence probability of two noisy labels to capture noisy label correlations. Subsequently, we employ sample selection techniques to extract information implying clean label correlations, which are then used to estimate the occurrence probability of one noisy label when a certain clean label appears. By exploiting the mismatches in label correlations implied by these occurrence probabilities, we demonstrate that the transition matrix becomes identifiable and can be acquired by solving a bilinear decomposition problem. Theoretically, we establish an estimation error bound for our multi-label transition matrix estimator and derive a generalization error bound for our statistically consistent algorithm. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of our estimator in estimating multi-label noise transition matrices, leading to excellent classification performance.

- **Summary**: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to jointly generate space occupancies and semantic labels for complex 3D scenes. Most existing SSC models focus on volumetric representations, which are memory-inefficient for large outdoor spaces. Point clouds provide a lightweight alternative but existing benchmarks lack outdoor point cloud scenes with semantic labels. To address this, we introduce PointSSC, the first cooperative vehicle-infrastructure point cloud benchmark for semantic scene completion. These scenes exhibit long-range perception and minimal occlusion. We develop an automated annotation pipeline leveraging Segment Anything to efficiently assign semantics. To benchmark progress, we propose a LiDAR-based model with a Spatial-Aware Transformer for global and local feature extraction and a Completion and Segmentation Cooperative Module for joint completion and segmentation. PointSSC provides a challenging testbed to drive advances in semantic point cloud completion for real-world navigation.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a Transformer-based image compression system that allows for a variable image quality objective according to the user's preference. Optimizing a learned codec for different quality objectives leads to reconstructed images with varying visual characteristics. Our method provides the user with the flexibility to choose a trade-off between two image quality objectives using a single, shared model. Motivated by the success of prompt-tuning techniques, we introduce prompt tokens to condition our Transformer-based autoencoder. These prompt tokens are generated adaptively based on the user's preference and input image through learning a prompt generation network. Extensive experiments on commonly used quality metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in adapting the encoding and/or decoding processes to a variable quality objective. While offering the additional flexibility, our proposed method performs comparably to the single-objective methods in terms of rate-distortion performance.

- **Summary**: While image data starts to enjoy the simple-but-effective self-supervised learning scheme built upon masking and self-reconstruction objective thanks to the introduction of tokenization procedure and vision transformer backbone, convolutional neural networks as another important and widely-adopted architecture for image data, though having contrastive-learning techniques to drive the self-supervised learning, still face the difficulty of leveraging such straightforward and general masking operation to benefit their learning process significantly. In this work, we aim to alleviate the burden of including masking operation into the contrastive-learning framework for convolutional neural networks as an extra augmentation method. In addition to the additive but unwanted edges (between masked and unmasked regions) as well as other adverse effects caused by the masking operations for ConvNets, which have been discussed by prior works, we particularly identify the potential problem where for one view in a contrastive sample-pair the randomly-sampled masking regions could be overly concentrated on important/salient objects thus resulting in misleading contrastiveness to the other view. To this end, we propose to explicitly take the saliency constraint into consideration in which the masked regions are more evenly distributed among the foreground and background for realizing the masking-based augmentation. Moreover, we introduce hard negative samples by masking larger regions of salient patches in an input image. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets, contrastive learning mechanisms, and downstream tasks well verify the efficacy as well as the superior performance of our proposed method with respect to several state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: Video analysis is a major computer vision task that has received a lot of attention in recent years. The current state-of-the-art performance for video analysis is achieved with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that have high computational costs and need large amounts of labeled data for training. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have significantly lower computational costs (thousands of times) than regular non-spiking networks when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. They have been used for video analysis with methods like 3D Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks (3D CSNNs). However, these networks have a significantly larger number of parameters compared with spiking 2D CSNN. This, not only increases the computational costs, but also makes these networks more difficult to implement with neuromorphic hardware. In this work, we use CSNNs trained in an unsupervised manner with the Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) rule, and we introduce, for the first time, Spiking Separated Spatial and Temporal Convolutions (S3TCs) for the sake of reducing the number of parameters required for video analysis. This unsupervised learning has the advantage of not needing large amounts of labeled data for training. Factorizing a single spatio-temporal spiking convolution into a spatial and a temporal spiking convolution decreases the number of parameters of the network. We test our network with the KTH, Weizmann, and IXMAS datasets, and we show that S3TCs successfully extract spatio-temporal information from videos, while increasing the output spiking activity, and outperforming spiking 3D convolutions.

- **Summary**: Open-set object recognition aims to identify if an object is from a class that has been encountered during training or not. To perform open-set object recognition accurately, a key challenge is how to reduce the reliance on spurious-discriminative features. In this paper, motivated by that different large models pre-trained through different paradigms can possess very rich while distinct implicit knowledge, we propose a novel framework named Large Model Collaboration (LMC) to tackle the above challenge via collaborating different off-the-shelf large models in a training-free manner. Moreover, we also incorporate the proposed framework with several novel designs to effectively extract implicit knowledge from large models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework. Code is available \href{https://github.com/Harryqu123/LMC}{here}.

- **Summary**: Eyebrows play a critical role in facial expression and appearance. Although the 3D digitization of faces is well explored, less attention has been drawn to 3D eyebrow modeling. In this work, we propose EMS, the first learning-based framework for single-view 3D eyebrow reconstruction. Following the methods of scalp hair reconstruction, we also represent the eyebrow as a set of fiber curves and convert the reconstruction to fibers growing problem. Three modules are then carefully designed: RootFinder firstly localizes the fiber root positions which indicates where to grow; OriPredictor predicts an orientation field in the 3D space to guide the growing of fibers; FiberEnder is designed to determine when to stop the growth of each fiber. Our OriPredictor is directly borrowing the method used in hair reconstruction. Considering the differences between hair and eyebrows, both RootFinder and FiberEnder are newly proposed. Specifically, to cope with the challenge that the root location is severely occluded, we formulate root localization as a density map estimation task. Given the predicted density map, a density-based clustering method is further used for finding the roots. For each fiber, the growth starts from the root point and moves step by step until the ending, where each step is defined as an oriented line with a constant length according to the predicted orientation field. To determine when to end, a pixel-aligned RNN architecture is designed to form a binary classifier, which outputs stop or not for each growing step. To support the training of all proposed networks, we build the first 3D synthetic eyebrow dataset that contains 400 high-quality eyebrow models manually created by artists. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed EMS pipeline on a variety of different eyebrow styles and lengths, ranging from short and sparse to long bushy eyebrows.

- **Summary**: With the development of the neural field, reconstructing the 3D model of a target object from multi-view inputs has recently attracted increasing attention from the community. Existing methods normally learn a neural field for the whole scene, while it is still under-explored how to reconstruct a certain object indicated by users on-the-fly. Considering the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown effectiveness in segmenting any 2D images, in this paper, we propose Neural Object Cloning (NOC), a novel high-quality 3D object reconstruction method, which leverages the benefits of both neural field and SAM from two aspects. Firstly, to separate the target object from the scene, we propose a novel strategy to lift the multi-view 2D segmentation masks of SAM into a unified 3D variation field. The 3D variation field is then projected into 2D space and generates the new prompts for SAM. This process is iterative until convergence to separate the target object from the scene. Then, apart from 2D masks, we further lift the 2D features of the SAM encoder into a 3D SAM field in order to improve the reconstruction quality of the target object. NOC lifts the 2D masks and features of SAM into the 3D neural field for high-quality target object reconstruction. We conduct detailed experiments on several benchmark datasets to demonstrate the advantages of our method. The code will be released.



### Scalable Semantic 3D Mapping of Coral Reefs with Deep Learning

- **Summary**: Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on our planet, and are depended on by hundreds of millions of people. Unfortunately, most coral reefs are existentially threatened by global climate change and local anthropogenic pressures. To better understand the dynamics underlying deterioration of reefs, monitoring at high spatial and temporal resolution is key. However, conventional monitoring methods for quantifying coral cover and species abundance are limited in scale due to the extensive manual labor required. Although computer vision tools have been employed to aid in this process, in particular SfM photogrammetry for 3D mapping and deep neural networks for image segmentation, analysis of the data products creates a bottleneck, effectively limiting their scalability. This paper presents a new paradigm for mapping underwater environments from ego-motion video, unifying 3D mapping systems that use machine learning to adapt to challenging conditions under water, combined with a modern approach for semantic segmentation of images. The method is exemplified on coral reefs in the northern Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, demonstrating high-precision 3D semantic mapping at unprecedented scale with significantly reduced required labor costs: a 100 m video transect acquired within 5 minutes of diving with a cheap consumer-grade camera can be fully automatically analyzed within 5 minutes. Our approach significantly scales up coral reef monitoring by taking a leap towards fully automatic analysis of video transects. The method democratizes coral reef transects by reducing the labor, equipment, logistics, and computing cost. This can help to inform conservation policies more efficiently. The underlying computational method of learning-based Structure-from-Motion has broad implications for fast low-cost mapping of underwater environments other than coral reefs.

- **Summary**: Background: View planning for the acquisition of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging remains a demanding task in clinical practice. Purpose: Existing approaches to its automation relied either on an additional volumetric image not typically acquired in clinic routine, or on laborious manual annotations of cardiac structural landmarks. This work presents a clinic-compatible, annotation-free system for automatic CMR view planning. Methods: The system mines the spatial relationship, more specifically, locates the intersecting lines, between the target planes and source views, and trains deep networks to regress heatmaps defined by distances from the intersecting lines. The intersection lines are the prescription lines prescribed by the technologists at the time of image acquisition using cardiac landmarks, and retrospectively identified from the spatial relationship. As the spatial relationship is self-contained in properly stored data, the need for additional manual annotation is eliminated. In addition, the interplay of multiple target planes predicted in a source view is utilized in a stacked hourglass architecture to gradually improve the regression. Then, a multi-view planning strategy is proposed to aggregate information from the predicted heatmaps for all the source views of a target plane, for a globally optimal prescription, mimicking the similar strategy practiced by skilled human prescribers. Results: The experiments include 181 CMR exams. Our system yields the mean angular difference and point-to-plane distance of 5.68 degrees and 3.12 mm, respectively. It not only achieves superior accuracy to existing approaches including conventional atlas-based and newer deep-learning-based in prescribing the four standard CMR planes but also demonstrates prescription of the first cardiac-anatomy-oriented plane(s) from the body-oriented scout.

- **Summary**: Few-shot learning has made impressive strides in addressing the crucial challenges of recognizing unknown samples from novel classes in target query sets and managing visual shifts between domains. However, existing techniques fall short when it comes to identifying target outliers under domain shifts by learning to reject pseudo-outliers from the source domain, resulting in an incomplete solution to both problems. To address these challenges comprehensively, we propose a novel approach called Domain Adaptive Few-Shot Open Set Recognition (DA-FSOS) and introduce a meta-learning-based architecture named DAFOSNET. During training, our model learns a shared and discriminative embedding space while creating a pseudo open-space decision boundary, given a fully-supervised source domain and a label-disjoint few-shot target domain. To enhance data density, we use a pair of conditional adversarial networks with tunable noise variances to augment both domains closed and pseudo-open spaces. Furthermore, we propose a domain-specific batch-normalized class prototypes alignment strategy to align both domains globally while ensuring class-discriminativeness through novel metric objectives. Our training approach ensures that DAFOS-NET can generalize well to new scenarios in the target domain. We present three benchmarks for DA-FSOS based on the Office-Home, mini-ImageNet/CUB, and DomainNet datasets and demonstrate the efficacy of DAFOS-NET through extensive experimentation

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation is essential for echocardiography-based assessment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the variability among sonographers and the inherent challenges of ultrasound images hinder precise segmentation. By leveraging the joint representation of image and text modalities, Vision-Language Segmentation Models (VLSMs) can incorporate rich contextual information, potentially aiding in accurate and explainable segmentation. However, the lack of readily available data in echocardiography hampers the training of VLSMs. In this study, we explore using synthetic datasets from Semantic Diffusion Models (SDMs) to enhance VLSMs for echocardiography segmentation. We evaluate results for two popular VLSMs (CLIPSeg and CRIS) using seven different kinds of language prompts derived from several attributes, automatically extracted from echocardiography images, segmentation masks, and their metadata. Our results show improved metrics and faster convergence when pretraining VLSMs on SDM-generated synthetic images before finetuning on real images. The code, configs, and prompts are available at https://github.com/naamiinepal/synthetic-boost.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation is a crucial task to measure distance relative to a camera, which is important for applications, such as robot navigation and self-driving. Traditional frame-based methods suffer from performance drops due to the limited dynamic range and motion blur. Therefore, recent works leverage novel event cameras to complement or guide the frame modality via frame-event feature fusion. However, event streams exhibit spatial sparsity, leaving some areas unperceived, especially in regions with marginal light changes. Therefore, direct fusion methods, e.g., RAMNet, often ignore the contribution of the most confident regions of each modality. This leads to structural ambiguity in the modality fusion process, thus degrading the depth estimation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Reliability-oriented Fusion Network (SRFNet), that can estimate depth with fine-grained structure at both daytime and nighttime. Our method consists of two key technical components. Firstly, we propose an attention-based interactive fusion (AIF) module that applies spatial priors of events and frames as the initial masks and learns the consensus regions to guide the inter-modal feature fusion. The fused feature are then fed back to enhance the frame and event feature learning. Meanwhile, it utilizes an output head to generate a fused mask, which is iteratively updated for learning consensual spatial priors. Secondly, we propose the Reliability-oriented Depth Refinement (RDR) module to estimate dense depth with the fine-grained structure based on the fused features and masks. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the synthetic and real-world datasets, which shows that, even without pretraining, our method outperforms the prior methods, e.g., RAMNet, especially in night scenes.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, the focus of survival analysis has shifted from examining clinical indicators to incorporating genomic profiles with pathological images. However, existing methods either directly adopt a straightforward fusion of pathological features and genomic profiles for survival prediction, or take genomic profiles as guidance to integrate the features of pathological images. The former would overlook intrinsic cross-modal correlations. The latter would discard pathological information irrelevant to gene expression. To address these issues, we present a Cross-Modal Translation and Alignment (CMTA) framework to explore the intrinsic cross-modal correlations and transfer potential complementary information. Specifically, we construct two parallel encoder-decoder structures for multi-modal data to integrate intra-modal information and generate cross-modal representation. Taking the generated cross-modal representation to enhance and recalibrate intra-modal representation can significantly improve its discrimination for comprehensive survival analysis. To explore the intrinsic crossmodal correlations, we further design a cross-modal attention module as the information bridge between different modalities to perform cross-modal interactions and transfer complementary information. Our extensive experiments on five public TCGA datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Emerging from the monolithic pairwise attention mechanism in conventional Transformer models, there is a growing interest in leveraging sparse interactions that align more closely with biological principles. Approaches including the Set Transformer and the Perceiver employ cross-attention consolidated with a latent space that forms an attention bottleneck with limited capacity. Building upon recent neuroscience studies of Global Workspace Theory and associative memory, we propose the Associative Transformer (AiT). AiT induces low-rank explicit memory that serves as both priors to guide bottleneck attention in the shared workspace and attractors within associative memory of a Hopfield network. Through joint end-to-end training, these priors naturally develop module specialization, each contributing a distinct inductive bias to form attention bottlenecks. A bottleneck can foster competition among inputs for writing information into the memory. We show that AiT is a sparse representation learner, learning distinct priors through the bottlenecks that are complexity-invariant to input quantities and dimensions. AiT demonstrates its superiority over methods such as the Set Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Coordination in various vision tasks.

- **Summary**: Recently, some researchers started exploring the use of ViTs in tackling HSI classification and achieved remarkable results. However, the training of ViT models requires a considerable number of training samples, while hyperspectral data, due to its high annotation costs, typically has a relatively small number of training samples. This contradiction has not been effectively addressed. In this paper, aiming to solve this problem, we propose the single-direction tuning (SDT) strategy, which serves as a bridge, allowing us to leverage existing labeled HSI datasets even RGB datasets to enhance the performance on new HSI datasets with limited samples. The proposed SDT inherits the idea of prompt tuning, aiming to reuse pre-trained models with minimal modifications for adaptation to new tasks. But unlike prompt tuning, SDT is custom-designed to accommodate the characteristics of HSIs. The proposed SDT utilizes a parallel architecture, an asynchronous cold-hot gradient update strategy, and unidirectional interaction. It aims to fully harness the potent representation learning capabilities derived from training on heterologous, even cross-modal datasets. In addition, we also introduce a novel Triplet-structured transformer (Tri-Former), where spectral attention and spatial attention modules are merged in parallel to construct the token mixing component for reducing computation cost and a 3D convolution-based channel mixer module is integrated to enhance stability and keep structure information. Comparison experiments conducted on three representative HSI datasets captured by different sensors demonstrate the proposed Tri-Former achieves better performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Homologous, heterologous and cross-modal tuning experiments verified the effectiveness of the proposed SDT.

- **Summary**: Existing video captioning approaches typically require to first sample video frames from a decoded video and then conduct a subsequent process (e.g., feature extraction and/or captioning model learning). In this pipeline, manual frame sampling may ignore key information in videos and thus degrade performance. Additionally, redundant information in the sampled frames may result in low efficiency in the inference of video captioning. Addressing this, we study video captioning from a different perspective in compressed domain, which brings multi-fold advantages over the existing pipeline: 1) Compared to raw images from the decoded video, the compressed video, consisting of I-frames, motion vectors and residuals, is highly distinguishable, which allows us to leverage the entire video for learning without manual sampling through a specialized model design; 2) The captioning model is more efficient in inference as smaller and less redundant information is processed. We propose a simple yet effective end-to-end transformer in the compressed domain for video captioning that enables learning from the compressed video for captioning. We show that even with a simple design, our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks while running almost 2x faster than existing approaches.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel one-stage end-to-end detector specifically designed to detect small lesions in medical images. Precise localization of small lesions presents challenges due to their appearance and the diverse contextual backgrounds in which they are found. To address this, our approach introduces a new type of pixel-based anchor that dynamically moves towards the targeted lesion for detection. We refer to this new architecture as GravityNet, and the novel anchors as gravity points since they appear to be "attracted" by the lesions. We conducted experiments on two well-established medical problems involving small lesions to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach: microcalcifications detection in digital mammograms and microaneurysms detection in digital fundus images. Our method demonstrates promising results in effectively detecting small lesions in these medical imaging tasks.



### Background Activation Suppression for Weakly Supervised Object Localization and Semantic Segmentation

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised object localization and semantic segmentation aim to localize objects using only image-level labels. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged by generating a foreground prediction map (FPM) to achieve pixel-level localization. While existing FPM-based methods use cross-entropy to evaluate the foreground prediction map and to guide the learning of the generator, this paper presents two astonishing experimental observations on the object localization learning process: For a trained network, as the foreground mask expands, 1) the cross-entropy converges to zero when the foreground mask covers only part of the object region. 2) The activation value continuously increases until the foreground mask expands to the object boundary. Therefore, to achieve a more effective localization performance, we argue for the usage of activation value to learn more object regions. In this paper, we propose a Background Activation Suppression (BAS) method. Specifically, an Activation Map Constraint (AMC) module is designed to facilitate the learning of generator by suppressing the background activation value. Meanwhile, by using foreground region guidance and area constraint, BAS can learn the whole region of the object. In the inference phase, we consider the prediction maps of different categories together to obtain the final localization results. Extensive experiments show that BAS achieves significant and consistent improvement over the baseline methods on the CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC datasets. In addition, our method also achieves state-of-the-art weakly supervised semantic segmentation performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.

- **Summary**: The reconstruction kernel in computed tomography (CT) generation determines the texture of the image. Consistency in reconstruction kernels is important as the underlying CT texture can impact measurements during quantitative image analysis. Harmonization (i.e., kernel conversion) minimizes differences in measurements due to inconsistent reconstruction kernels. Existing methods investigate harmonization of CT scans in single or multiple manufacturers. However, these methods require paired scans of hard and soft reconstruction kernels that are spatially and anatomically aligned. Additionally, a large number of models need to be trained across different kernel pairs within manufacturers. In this study, we adopt an unpaired image translation approach to investigate harmonization between and across reconstruction kernels from different manufacturers by constructing a multipath cycle generative adversarial network (GAN). We use hard and soft reconstruction kernels from the Siemens and GE vendors from the National Lung Screening Trial dataset. We use 50 scans from each reconstruction kernel and train a multipath cycle GAN. To evaluate the effect of harmonization on the reconstruction kernels, we harmonize 50 scans each from Siemens hard kernel, GE soft kernel and GE hard kernel to a reference Siemens soft kernel (B30f) and evaluate percent emphysema. We fit a linear model by considering the age, smoking status, sex and vendor and perform an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the emphysema scores. Our approach minimizes differences in emphysema measurement and highlights the impact of age, sex, smoking status and vendor on emphysema quantification.

- **Summary**: Collaborative perception, which greatly enhances the sensing capability of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) by incorporating data from external resources, also brings forth potential security risks. CAVs' driving decisions rely on remote untrusted data, making them susceptible to attacks carried out by malicious participants in the collaborative perception system. However, security analysis and countermeasures for such threats are absent. To understand the impact of the vulnerability, we break the ground by proposing various real-time data fabrication attacks in which the attacker delivers crafted malicious data to victims in order to perturb their perception results, leading to hard brakes or increased collision risks. Our attacks demonstrate a high success rate of over 86\% on high-fidelity simulated scenarios and are realizable in real-world experiments. To mitigate the vulnerability, we present a systematic anomaly detection approach that enables benign vehicles to jointly reveal malicious fabrication. It detects 91.5% of attacks with a false positive rate of 3% in simulated scenarios and significantly mitigates attack impacts in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Open-set object detection aims at detecting arbitrary categories beyond those seen during training. Most recent advancements have adopted the open-vocabulary paradigm, utilizing vision-language backbones to represent categories with language. In this paper, we introduce DE-ViT, an open-set object detector that employs vision-only DINOv2 backbones and learns new categories through example images instead of language. To improve general detection ability, we transform multi-classification tasks into binary classification tasks while bypassing per-class inference, and propose a novel region propagation technique for localization. We evaluate DE-ViT on open-vocabulary, few-shot, and one-shot object detection benchmark with COCO and LVIS. For COCO, DE-ViT outperforms the open-vocabulary SoTA by 6.9 AP50 and achieves 50 AP50 in novel classes. DE-ViT surpasses the few-shot SoTA by 15 mAP on 10-shot and 7.2 mAP on 30-shot and one-shot SoTA by 2.8 AP50. For LVIS, DE-ViT outperforms the open-vocabulary SoTA by 2.2 mask AP and reaches 34.3 mask APr. Code is available at https://github.com/mlzxy/devit.

- **Summary**: The detailed images produced by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provide life-critical information for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. To provide standardized acquisition, interpretation and usage of the complex MRI images, the PI-RADS v2 guideline was proposed. An automated segmentation following the guideline facilitates consistent and precise lesion detection, staging and treatment. The guideline recommends a division of the prostate into four zones, PZ (peripheral zone), TZ (transition zone), DPU (distal prostatic urethra) and AFS (anterior fibromuscular stroma). Not every zone shares a boundary with the others and is present in every slice. Further, the representations captured by a single model might not suffice for all zones. This motivated us to design a dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN), where each branch captures the representations of the connected zones separately. Further, the representations from different branches act complementary to each other at the second stage of training, where they are fine-tuned through an unsupervised loss. The loss penalises the difference in predictions from the two branches for the same class. We also incorporate multi-task learning in our framework to further improve the segmentation accuracy. The proposed approach improves the segmentation accuracy of the baseline (mean absolute symmetric distance) by 7.56%, 11.00%, 58.43% and 19.67% for PZ, TZ, DPU and AFS zones respectively.

- **Summary**: In the realm of research, the detection/recognition of text within images/videos captured by cameras constitutes a highly challenging problem for researchers. Despite certain advancements achieving high accuracy, current methods still require substantial improvements to be applicable in practical scenarios. Diverging from text detection in images/videos, this paper addresses the issue of text detection within license plates by amalgamating multiple frames of distinct perspectives. For each viewpoint, the proposed method extracts descriptive features characterizing the text components of the license plate, specifically corner points and area. Concretely, we present three viewpoints: view-1, view-2, and view-3, to identify the nearest neighboring components facilitating the restoration of text components from the same license plate line based on estimations of similarity levels and distance metrics. Subsequently, we employ the CnOCR method for text recognition within license plates. Experimental results on the self-collected dataset (PTITPlates), comprising pairs of images in various scenarios, and the publicly available Stanford Cars Dataset, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces the Point Cloud Network (PCN) architecture, a novel implementation of linear layers in deep learning networks, and provides empirical evidence to advocate for its preference over the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) in linear layers. We train several models, including the original AlexNet, using both MLP and PCN architectures for direct comparison of linear layers (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). The key results collected are model parameter count and top-1 test accuracy over the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets (Krizhevsky, 2009). AlexNet-PCN16, our PCN equivalent to AlexNet, achieves comparable efficacy (test accuracy) to the original architecture with a 99.5% reduction of parameters in its linear layers. All training is done on cloud RTX 4090 GPUs, leveraging pytorch for model construction and training. Code is provided for anyone to reproduce the trials from this paper.

- **Summary**: The rapid development of AR/VR brings tremendous demands for 3D content. While the widely-used Computer-Aided Design (CAD) method requires a time-consuming and labor-intensive modeling process, sketch-based 3D modeling offers a potential solution as a natural form of computer-human interaction. However, the sparsity and ambiguity of sketches make it challenging to generate high-fidelity content reflecting creators' ideas. Precise drawing from multiple views or strategic step-by-step drawings is often required to tackle the challenge but is not friendly to novice users. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end approach, Deep3DSketch+, which performs 3D modeling using only a single free-hand sketch without inputting multiple sketches or view information. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight generation network for efficient inference in real-time and a structural-aware adversarial training approach with a Stroke Enhancement Module (SEM) to capture the structural information to facilitate learning of the realistic and fine-detailed shape structures for high-fidelity performance. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both synthetic and real datasets.

- **Summary**: Medical imaging plays a crucial role in modern healthcare by providing non-invasive visualisation of internal structures and abnormalities, enabling early disease detection, accurate diagnosis, and treatment planning. This study aims to explore the application of deep learning models, particularly focusing on the UNet architecture and its variants, in medical image segmentation. We seek to evaluate the performance of these models across various challenging medical image segmentation tasks, addressing issues such as image normalization, resizing, architecture choices, loss function design, and hyperparameter tuning. The findings reveal that the standard UNet, when extended with a deep network layer, is a proficient medical image segmentation model, while the Res-UNet and Attention Res-UNet architectures demonstrate smoother convergence and superior performance, particularly when handling fine image details. The study also addresses the challenge of high class imbalance through careful preprocessing and loss function definitions. We anticipate that the results of this study will provide useful insights for researchers seeking to apply these models to new medical imaging problems and offer guidance and best practices for their implementation.

- **Summary**: Hand-crafted image quality metrics, such as PSNR and SSIM, are commonly used to evaluate model privacy risk under reconstruction attacks. Under these metrics, reconstructed images that are determined to resemble the original one generally indicate more privacy leakage. Images determined as overall dissimilar, on the other hand, indicate higher robustness against attack. However, there is no guarantee that these metrics well reflect human opinions, which, as a judgement for model privacy leakage, are more trustworthy. In this paper, we comprehensively study the faithfulness of these hand-crafted metrics to human perception of privacy information from the reconstructed images. On 5 datasets ranging from natural images, faces, to fine-grained classes, we use 4 existing attack methods to reconstruct images from many different classification models and, for each reconstructed image, we ask multiple human annotators to assess whether this image is recognizable. Our studies reveal that the hand-crafted metrics only have a weak correlation with the human evaluation of privacy leakage and that even these metrics themselves often contradict each other. These observations suggest risks of current metrics in the community. To address this potential risk, we propose a learning-based measure called SemSim to evaluate the Semantic Similarity between the original and reconstructed images. SemSim is trained with a standard triplet loss, using an original image as an anchor, one of its recognizable reconstructed images as a positive sample, and an unrecognizable one as a negative. By training on human annotations, SemSim exhibits a greater reflection of privacy leakage on the semantic level. We show that SemSim has a significantly higher correlation with human judgment compared with existing metrics. Moreover, this strong correlation generalizes to unseen datasets, models and attack methods.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have revolutionized the field of image-based view synthesis. However, NeRF uses straight rays and fails to deal with complicated light path changes caused by refraction and reflection. This prevents NeRF from successfully synthesizing transparent or specular objects, which are ubiquitous in real-world robotics and A/VR applications. In this paper, we introduce the refractive-reflective field. Taking the object silhouette as input, we first utilize marching tetrahedra with a progressive encoding to reconstruct the geometry of non-Lambertian objects and then model refraction and reflection effects of the object in a unified framework using Fresnel terms. Meanwhile, to achieve efficient and effective anti-aliasing, we propose a virtual cone supersampling technique. We benchmark our method on different shapes, backgrounds and Fresnel terms on both real-world and synthetic datasets. We also qualitatively and quantitatively benchmark the rendering results of various editing applications, including material editing, object replacement/insertion, and environment illumination estimation.

- **Summary**: Pre-training on Internet data has proven to be a key ingredient for broad generalization in many modern ML systems. What would it take to enable such capabilities in robotic reinforcement learning (RL)? Offline RL methods, which learn from datasets of robot experience, offer one way to leverage prior data into the robotic learning pipeline. However, these methods have a "type mismatch" with video data (such as Ego4D), the largest prior datasets available for robotics, since video offers observation-only experience without the action or reward annotations needed for RL methods. In this paper, we develop a system for leveraging large-scale human video datasets in robotic offline RL, based entirely on learning value functions via temporal-difference learning. We show that value learning on video datasets learns representations that are more conducive to downstream robotic offline RL than other approaches for learning from video data. Our system, called V-PTR, combines the benefits of pre-training on video data with robotic offline RL approaches that train on diverse robot data, resulting in value functions and policies for manipulation tasks that perform better, act robustly, and generalize broadly. On several manipulation tasks on a real WidowX robot, our framework produces policies that greatly improve over prior methods.

- **Summary**: We present MosaicFusion, a simple yet effective diffusion-based data augmentation approach for large vocabulary instance segmentation. Our method is training-free and does not rely on any label supervision. Two key designs enable us to employ an off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion model as a useful dataset generator for object instances and mask annotations. First, we divide an image canvas into several regions and perform a single round of diffusion process to generate multiple instances simultaneously, conditioning on different text prompts. Second, we obtain corresponding instance masks by aggregating cross-attention maps associated with object prompts across layers and diffusion time steps, followed by simple thresholding and edge-aware refinement processing. Without bells and whistles, our MosaicFusion can produce a significant amount of synthetic labeled data for both rare and novel categories. Experimental results on the challenging LVIS long-tailed and open-vocabulary benchmarks demonstrate that MosaicFusion can significantly improve the performance of existing instance segmentation models, especially for rare and novel categories. Code will be released at https://github.com/Jiahao000/MosaicFusion.
