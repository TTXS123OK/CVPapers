- **Summary**: In the evolving field of machine learning, video generation has witnessed significant advancements with autoregressive-based transformer models and diffusion models, known for synthesizing dynamic and realistic scenes. However, these models often face challenges with prolonged inference times, even for generating short video clips such as GIFs. This paper introduces FlashVideo, a novel framework tailored for swift Text-to-Video generation. FlashVideo represents the first successful adaptation of the RetNet architecture for video generation, bringing a unique approach to the field. Leveraging the RetNet-based architecture, FlashVideo reduces the time complexity of inference from $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ for a sequence of length $L$, significantly accelerating inference speed. Additionally, we adopt a redundant-free frame interpolation method, enhancing the efficiency of frame interpolation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves a $\times9.17$ efficiency improvement over a traditional autoregressive-based transformer model, and its inference speed is of the same order of magnitude as that of BERT-based transformer models.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models trained with mean squared error loss tend to generate unrealistic samples. Current state-of-the-art models rely on classifier-free guidance to improve sample quality, yet its surprising effectiveness is not fully understood. In this paper, We show that the effectiveness of classifier-free guidance partly originates from it being a form of implicit perceptual guidance. As a result, we can directly incorporate perceptual loss in diffusion training to improve sample quality. Since the score matching objective used in diffusion training strongly resembles the denoising autoencoder objective used in unsupervised training of perceptual networks, the diffusion model itself is a perceptual network and can be used to generate meaningful perceptual loss. We propose a novel self-perceptual objective that results in diffusion models capable of generating more realistic samples. For conditional generation, our method only improves sample quality without entanglement with the conditional input and therefore does not sacrifice sample diversity. Our method can also improve sample quality for unconditional generation, which was not possible with classifier-free guidance before.

- **Summary**: Although planning is a crucial component of the autonomous driving stack, researchers have yet to develop robust planning algorithms that are capable of safely handling the diverse range of possible driving scenarios. Learning-based planners suffer from overfitting and poor long-tail performance. On the other hand, rule-based planners generalize well, but might fail to handle scenarios that require complex driving maneuvers. To address these limitations, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the common-sense reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT4 and Llama2 to generate plans for self-driving vehicles. In particular, we develop a novel hybrid planner that leverages a conventional rule-based planner in conjunction with an LLM-based planner. Guided by commonsense reasoning abilities of LLMs, our approach navigates complex scenarios which existing planners struggle with, produces well-reasoned outputs while also remaining grounded through working alongside the rule-based approach. Through extensive evaluation on the nuPlan benchmark, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all existing pure learning- and rule-based methods across most metrics.

- **Summary**: $ $The synergy of language and vision models has given rise to Large Language and Vision Assistant models (LLVAs), designed to engage users in rich conversational experiences intertwined with image-based queries. These comprehensive multimodal models seamlessly integrate vision encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs), expanding their applications in general-purpose language and visual comprehension. The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) heralds a new era in Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistance, extending the horizons of AI utilization. This paper takes a unique perspective on LMMs, exploring their efficacy in performing image classification tasks using tailored prompts designed for specific datasets. We also investigate the LLVAs zero-shot learning capabilities. Our study includes a benchmarking analysis across four diverse datasets: MNIST, Cats Vs. Dogs, Hymnoptera (Ants Vs. Bees), and an unconventional dataset comprising Pox Vs. Non-Pox skin images. The results of our experiments demonstrate the model's remarkable performance, achieving classification accuracies of 85\%, 100\%, 77\%, and 79\% for the respective datasets without any fine-tuning. To bolster our analysis, we assess the model's performance post fine-tuning for specific tasks. In one instance, fine-tuning is conducted over a dataset comprising images of faces of children with and without autism. Prior to fine-tuning, the model demonstrated a test accuracy of 55\%, which significantly improved to 83\% post fine-tuning. These results, coupled with our prior findings, underscore the transformative potential of LLVAs and their versatile applications in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and lethal human cancers. Intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for treatment. Biopsy is invasive, which motivates the development of non-invasive, MRI-based machine learning (ML) models to quantify intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity for each patient. This capability holds great promise for enabling better therapeutic selection to improve patient outcomes. We proposed a novel Weakly Supervised Ordinal Support Vector Machine (WSO-SVM) to predict regional genetic alteration status within each GBM tumor using MRI. WSO-SVM was applied to a unique dataset of 318 image-localized biopsies with spatially matched multiparametric MRI from 74 GBM patients. The model was trained to predict the regional genetic alteration of three GBM driver genes (EGFR, PDGFRA, and PTEN) based on features extracted from the corresponding region of five MRI contrast images. For comparison, a variety of existing ML algorithms were also applied. The classification accuracy of each gene was compared between the different algorithms. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was further applied to compute contribution scores of different contrast images. Finally, the trained WSO-SVM was used to generate prediction maps within the tumoral area of each patient to help visualize the intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using MRI and WSO-SVM to enable non-invasive prediction of intra-tumoral regional genetic alteration for each GBM patient, which can inform future adaptive therapies for individualized oncology.

- **Summary**: Identifying spatially complete planar primitives from visual data is a crucial task in computer vision. Prior methods are largely restricted to either 2D segment recovery or simplifying 3D structures, even with extensive plane annotations. We present PlanarNeRF, a novel framework capable of detecting dense 3D planes through online learning. Drawing upon the neural field representation, PlanarNeRF brings three major contributions. First, it enhances 3D plane detection with concurrent appearance and geometry knowledge. Second, a lightweight plane fitting module is proposed to estimate plane parameters. Third, a novel global memory bank structure with an update mechanism is introduced, ensuring consistent cross-frame correspondence. The flexible architecture of PlanarNeRF allows it to function in both 2D-supervised and self-supervised solutions, in each of which it can effectively learn from sparse training signals, significantly improving training efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanarNeRF in various scenarios and remarkable improvement over existing works.

- **Summary**: Although sparse-view computed tomography (CT) has significantly reduced radiation dose, it also introduces severe artifacts which degrade the image quality. In recent years, deep learning-based methods for inverse problems have made remarkable progress and have become increasingly popular in CT reconstruction. However, most of these methods suffer several limitations: dependence on high-quality training data, weak interpretability, etc. In this study, we propose a fully unsupervised framework called Deep Radon Prior (DRP), inspired by Deep Image Prior (DIP), to address the aforementioned limitations. DRP introduces a neural network as an implicit prior into the iterative method, thereby realizing cross-domain gradient feedback. During the reconstruction process, the neural network is progressively optimized in multiple stages to narrow the solution space in radon domain for the under-constrained imaging protocol, and the convergence of the proposed method has been discussed in this work. Compared with the popular pre-trained method, the proposed framework requires no dataset and exhibits superior interpretability and generalization ability. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate detailed images while effectively suppressing image artifacts.Meanwhile, DRP achieves comparable or better performance than the supervised methods.

- **Summary**: The extensive adoption of Self-supervised learning (SSL) has led to an increased security threat from backdoor attacks. While existing research has mainly focused on backdoor attacks in image classification, there has been limited exploration into their implications for object detection. In this work, we propose the first backdoor attack designed for object detection tasks in SSL scenarios, termed Object Transform Attack (SSL-OTA). SSL-OTA employs a trigger capable of altering predictions of the target object to the desired category, encompassing two attacks: Data Poisoning Attack (NA) and Dual-Source Blending Attack (DSBA). NA conducts data poisoning during downstream fine-tuning of the object detector, while DSBA additionally injects backdoors into the pre-trained encoder. We establish appropriate metrics and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and utility of our proposed attack. Notably, both NA and DSBA achieve high attack success rates (ASR) at extremely low poisoning rates (0.5%). The results underscore the importance of considering backdoor threats in SSL-based object detection and contribute a novel perspective to the field.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning is a popular and powerful method for utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data, for which a wide variety of training objectives have been proposed in the literature. In this study, we perform a Bayesian analysis of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning objectives, elucidating the underlying probabilistic graphical models in each class and presenting a standardized methodology for their derivation from first principles. The analysis also indicates a natural means of integrating self-supervised learning with likelihood-based generative models. We instantiate this concept within the realm of cluster-based self-supervised learning and energy models, introducing a novel lower bound which is proven to reliably penalize the most important failure modes. Furthermore, this newly proposed lower bound enables the training of a standard backbone architecture without the necessity for asymmetric elements such as stop gradients, momentum encoders, or specialized clustering layers - typically introduced to avoid learning trivial solutions. Our theoretical findings are substantiated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, thus showing that our objective function allows to outperform existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering, generation and out-of-distribution detection performance by a wide margin. We also demonstrate that GEDI can be integrated into a neural-symbolic framework to mitigate the reasoning shortcut problem and to learn higher quality symbolic representations thanks to the enhanced classification performance.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles increasingly utilize the vision-based perception module to acquire information about driving environments and detect obstacles. Correct detection and classification are important to ensure safe driving decisions. Existing works have demonstrated the feasibility of fooling the perception models such as object detectors and image classifiers with printed adversarial patches. However, most of them are indiscriminately offensive to every passing autonomous vehicle. In this paper, we propose TPatch, a physical adversarial patch triggered by acoustic signals. Unlike other adversarial patches, TPatch remains benign under normal circumstances but can be triggered to launch a hiding, creating or altering attack by a designed distortion introduced by signal injection attacks towards cameras. To avoid the suspicion of human drivers and make the attack practical and robust in the real world, we propose a content-based camouflage method and an attack robustness enhancement method to strengthen it. Evaluations with three object detectors, YOLO V3/V5 and Faster R-CNN, and eight image classifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of TPatch in both the simulation and the real world. We also discuss possible defenses at the sensor, algorithm, and system levels.

- **Summary**: The proliferation of images captured from millions of cameras and the advancement of facial recognition (FR) technology have made the abuse of FR a severe privacy threat. Existing works typically rely on obfuscation, synthesis, or adversarial examples to modify faces in images to achieve anti-facial recognition (AFR). However, the unmodified images captured by camera modules that contain sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) could still be leaked. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, CamPro, to capture inborn AFR images. CamPro enables well-packed commodity camera modules to produce images that contain little PII and yet still contain enough information to support other non-sensitive vision applications, such as person detection. Specifically, CamPro tunes the configuration setup inside the camera image signal processor (ISP), i.e., color correction matrix and gamma correction, to achieve AFR, and designs an image enhancer to keep the image quality for possible human viewers. We implemented and validated CamPro on a proof-of-concept camera, and our experiments demonstrate its effectiveness on ten state-of-the-art black-box FR models. The results show that CamPro images can significantly reduce face identification accuracy to 0.3\% while having little impact on the targeted non-sensitive vision application. Furthermore, we find that CamPro is resilient to adaptive attackers who have re-trained their FR models using images generated by CamPro, even with full knowledge of privacy-preserving ISP parameters.

- **Summary**: Occlusion presents a significant challenge in human pose estimation. The challenges posed by occlusion can be attributed to the following factors: 1) Data: The collection and annotation of occluded human pose samples are relatively challenging. 2) Feature: Occlusion can cause feature confusion due to the high similarity between the target person and interfering individuals. 3) Inference: Robust inference becomes challenging due to the loss of complete body structural information. The existing methods designed for occluded human pose estimation usually focus on addressing only one of these factors. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework DAG (Data, Attention, Graph) to address the performance degradation caused by occlusion. Specifically, we introduce the mask joints with instance paste data augmentation technique to simulate occlusion scenarios. Additionally, an Adaptive Discriminative Attention Module (ADAM) is proposed to effectively enhance the features of target individuals. Furthermore, we present the Feature-Guided Multi-Hop GCN (FGMP-GCN) to fully explore the prior knowledge of body structure and improve pose estimation results. Through extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets for occluded human pose estimation, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods. Code and data will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Progression of hip osteoarthritis (hip OA) leads to pain and disability, likely leading to surgical treatment such as hip arthroplasty at the terminal stage. The severity of hip OA is often classified using the Crowe and Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classifications. However, as the classification is subjective, we aimed to develop an automated approach to classify the disease severity based on the two grades using digitally-reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from CT images. Automatic grading of the hip OA severity was performed using deep learning-based models. The models were trained to predict the disease grade using two grading schemes, i.e., predicting the Crowe and KL grades separately, and predicting a new ordinal label combining both grades and representing the disease progression of hip OA. The models were trained in classification and regression settings. In addition, the model uncertainty was estimated and validated as a predictor of classification accuracy. The models were trained and validated on a database of 197 hip OA patients, and externally validated on 52 patients. The model accuracy was evaluated using exact class accuracy (ECA), one-neighbor class accuracy (ONCA), and balanced accuracy.The deep learning models produced a comparable accuracy of approximately 0.65 (ECA) and 0.95 (ONCA) in the classification and regression settings. The model uncertainty was significantly larger in cases with large classification errors (P<6e-3). In this study, an automatic approach for grading hip OA severity from CT images was developed. The models have shown comparable performance with high ONCA, which facilitates automated grading in large-scale CT databases and indicates the potential for further disease progression analysis. Classification accuracy was correlated with the model uncertainty, which would allow for the prediction of classification errors.

- **Summary**: The generative priors of pre-trained latent diffusion models have demonstrated great potential to enhance the perceptual quality of image super-resolution (SR) results. Unfortunately, the existing diffusion prior-based SR methods encounter a common problem, i.e., they tend to generate rather different outputs for the same low-resolution image with different noise samples. Such stochasticity is desired for text-to-image generation tasks but problematic for SR tasks, where the image contents are expected to be well preserved. To improve the stability of diffusion prior-based SR, we propose to employ the diffusion models to refine image structures, while employing the generative adversarial training to enhance image fine details. Specifically, we propose a non-uniform timestep learning strategy to train a compact diffusion network, which has high efficiency and stability to reproduce the image main structures, and finetune the pre-trained decoder of variational auto-encoder (VAE) by adversarial training for detail enhancement. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method, namely content consistent super-resolution (CCSR), can significantly reduce the stochasticity of diffusion prior-based SR, improving the content consistency of SR outputs and speeding up the image generation process. Codes and models can be found at {https://github.com/csslc/CCSR}.

- **Summary**: Current Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can generate photorealistic novel views. For editing 3D scenes represented by NeRF, with the advent of generative models, this paper proposes Inpaint4DNeRF to capitalize on state-of-the-art stable diffusion models (e.g., ControlNet) for direct generation of the underlying completed background content, regardless of static or dynamic. The key advantages of this generative approach for NeRF inpainting are twofold. First, after rough mask propagation, to complete or fill in previously occluded content, we can individually generate a small subset of completed images with plausible content, called seed images, from which simple 3D geometry proxies can be derived. Second and the remaining problem is thus 3D multiview consistency among all completed images, now guided by the seed images and their 3D proxies. Without other bells and whistles, our generative Inpaint4DNeRF baseline framework is general which can be readily extended to 4D dynamic NeRFs, where temporal consistency can be naturally handled in a similar way as our multiview consistency.

- **Summary**: Wind turbines are subjected to continuous rotational stresses and unusual external forces such as storms, lightning, strikes by flying objects, etc., which may cause defects in turbine blades. Hence, it requires a periodical inspection to ensure proper functionality and avoid catastrophic failure. The task of inspection is challenging due to the remote location and inconvenient reachability by human inspection. Researchers used images with cropped defects from the wind turbine in the literature. They neglected possible background biases, which may hinder real-time and autonomous defect detection using aerial vehicles such as drones or others. To overcome such challenges, in this paper, we experiment with defect detection accuracy by having the defects with the background using a two-step deep-learning methodology. In the first step, we develop virtual models of wind turbines to synthesize the near-reality images for four types of common defects - cracks, leading edge erosion, bending, and light striking damage. The Unity perception package is used to generate wind turbine blade defects images with variations in background, randomness, camera angle, and light effects. In the second step, a customized U-Net architecture is trained to classify and segment the defect in turbine blades. The outcomes of U-Net architecture have been thoroughly tested and compared with 5-fold validation datasets. The proposed methodology provides reasonable defect detection accuracy, making it suitable for autonomous and remote inspection through aerial vehicles.

- **Summary**: The Swin Transformer image super-resolution reconstruction network only relies on the long-range relationship of window attention and shifted window attention to explore features. This mechanism has two limitations. On the one hand, it only focuses on global features while ignoring local features. On the other hand, it is only concerned with spatial feature interactions while ignoring channel features and channel interactions, thus limiting its non-linear mapping ability. To address the above limitations, this paper proposes enhanced Swin Transformer modules via alternating aggregation of local-global features. In the local feature aggregation stage, this paper introduces shift convolution to realize the interaction between local spatial information and channel information. This paper proposes a block sparse global perception module in the global feature aggregation stage. This module organizes the spatial information first, then sends the recombination information into a spatial gating unit to implement the further interaction of spatial and channel information. Then, a multi-scale self-attention module and a low-parameter residual channel attention module are introduced to realize information aggregation at different scales. Finally, the proposed network is validated on five publicly available datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed network outperforms the other state-of-the-art super-resolution networks.

- **Summary**: Numerical simulations can model the physical processes that govern cardiovascular device deployment. When such simulations incorporate digital twins; computational models of patient-specific anatomy, they can expedite and de-risk the device design process. Nonetheless, the exclusive use of patient-specific data constrains the anatomic variability which can be precisely or fully explored. In this study, we investigate the capacity of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to edit digital twins to create anatomic variants, which we term digital siblings. Digital twins and their corresponding siblings can serve as the basis for comparative simulations, enabling the study of how subtle anatomic variations impact the simulated deployment of cardiovascular devices, as well as the augmentation of virtual cohorts for device assessment. However, while diffusion models have been characterized in their ability to edit natural images, their capacity to anatomically edit digital twins has yet to be studied. Using a case example centered on 3D digital twins of cardiac anatomy, we implement various methods for generating digital siblings and characterize them through morphological and topological analyses. We specifically edit digital twins to introduce anatomic variation at different spatial scales and within localized regions, demonstrating the existence of bias towards common anatomic features. We further show that such anatomic bias can be leveraged for virtual cohort augmentation through selective editing, partially alleviating issues related to dataset imbalance and lack of diversity. Our experimental framework thus delineates the limits and capabilities of using latent diffusion models in synthesizing anatomic variation for in silico trials.

- **Summary**: Segmenting any object represents a crucial step towards achieving artificial general intelligence, and the "Segment Anything Model" (SAM) has significantly advanced the development of foundational models in computer vision. We have high expectations regarding whether SAM can enhance highly accurate dichotomous image segmentation. In fact, the evidence presented in this article demonstrates that by inputting SAM with simple prompt boxes and utilizing the results output by SAM as input for IS5Net, we can greatly improve the effectiveness of highly accurate dichotomous image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) arises as a promising option for Vision Transformers among various self-supervised learning (SSL) methods. The essence of MIM lies in token-wise masked patch predictions, with targets patchified from images; or generated by pre-trained tokenizers or models. We argue targets from the pre-trained models usually exhibit spatial inconsistency, which makes it excessively challenging for the model to follow to learn more discriminative representations. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a novel self-supervision signal based on Dynamic Token Morphing (DTM), which dynamically aggregates contextually related tokens. DTM can be generally applied to various SSL frameworks, yet we propose a simple MIM that employs DTM to effectively improve the performance barely introducing extra training costs. Our experiments on ImageNet-1K and ADE20K evidently demonstrate the superiority of our methods. Furthermore, the comparative evaluation of iNaturalist and Fine-grained Visual Classification datasets further validates the transferability of our method on various downstream tasks. Our code will be released publicly.

- **Summary**: Over the past decade, visual gaze estimation has garnered growing attention within the research community, thanks to its wide-ranging application scenarios. While existing estimation approaches have achieved remarkable success in enhancing prediction accuracy, they primarily infer gaze directions from single-image signals and discard the huge potentials of the currently dominant text guidance. Notably, visual-language collaboration has been extensively explored across a range of visual tasks, such as image synthesis and manipulation, leveraging the remarkable transferability of large-scale Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model. Nevertheless, existing gaze estimation approaches ignore the rich semantic cues conveyed by linguistic signals and priors in CLIP feature space, thereby yielding performance setbacks. In pursuit of making up this gap, we delve deeply into the text-eye collaboration protocol and introduce a novel gaze estimation framework in this paper, referred to as GazeCLIP. Specifically, we intricately design a linguistic description generator to produce text signals with coarse directional cues. Additionally, a CLIP-based backbone that excels in characterizing text-eye pairs for gaze estimation is presented. This is followed by the implementation of a fine-grained multi-modal fusion module aimed at modeling the interrelationships between heterogeneous inputs. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GazeCLIP which surpasses the previous approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art estimation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Pretrained large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated excellent generalizability over a series of downstream tasks. However, they are sensitive to the variation of input text prompts and need a selection of prompt templates to achieve satisfactory performance. Recently, various methods have been proposed to dynamically learn the prompts as the textual inputs to avoid the requirements of laboring hand-crafted prompt engineering in the fine-tuning process. We notice that these methods are suboptimal in two aspects. First, the prompts of the vision and language branches in these methods are usually separated or uni-directionally correlated. Thus, the prompts of both branches are not fully correlated and may not provide enough guidance to align the representations of both branches. Second, it's observed that most previous methods usually achieve better performance on seen classes but cause performance degeneration on unseen classes compared to CLIP. This is because the essential generic knowledge learned in the pretraining stage is partly forgotten in the fine-tuning process. In this paper, we propose Co-Articulated Multi-Modal Learning (COMMA) to handle the above limitations. Especially, our method considers prompts from both branches to generate the prompts to enhance the representation alignment of both branches. Besides, to alleviate forgetting about the essential knowledge, we minimize the feature discrepancy between the learned prompts and the embeddings of hand-crafted prompts in the pre-trained CLIP in the late transformer layers. We evaluate our method across three representative tasks of generalization to novel classes, new target datasets and unseen domain shifts. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method by exhibiting a favorable performance boost upon all tasks with high efficiency.

- **Summary**: Existing gait recognition benchmarks mostly include minor clothing variations in the laboratory environments, but lack persistent changes in appearance over time and space. In this paper, we propose the first in-the-wild benchmark CCGait for cloth-changing gait recognition, which incorporates diverse clothing changes, indoor and outdoor scenes, and multi-modal statistics over 92 days. To further address the coupling effect of clothing and viewpoint variations, we propose a hybrid approach HybridGait that exploits both temporal dynamics and the projected 2D information of 3D human meshes. Specifically, we introduce a Canonical Alignment Spatial-Temporal Transformer (CA-STT) module to encode human joint position-aware features, and fully exploit 3D dense priors via a Silhouette-guided Deformation with 3D-2D Appearance Projection (SilD) strategy. Our contributions are twofold: we provide a challenging benchmark CCGait that captures realistic appearance changes across an expanded and space, and we propose a hybrid framework HybridGait that outperforms prior works on CCGait and Gait3D benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging medical imaging modality which has gained increasing interest in recent years. Among the benefits of MPI are its high temporal resolution, and that the technique does not expose the specimen to any kind of ionizing radiation. It is based on the non-linear response of magnetic nanoparticles to an applied magnetic field. From the electric signal measured in receive coils, the particle concentration has to be reconstructed. Due to the ill-posedness of the reconstruction problem, various regularization methods have been proposed for reconstruction ranging from early stopping methods, via classical Tikhonov regularization and iterative methods to modern machine learning approaches. In this work, we contribute to the latter class: we propose a plug-and-play approach based on a generic zero-shot denoiser with an $\ell^1$-prior. Moreover, we develop parameter selection strategies. Finally, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the proposed algorithmic scheme on the 3D Open MPI data set with different levels of preprocessing.

- **Summary**: In a scenario where multi-modal cameras are operating together, the problem of working with non-aligned images cannot be avoided. Yet, existing image fusion algorithms rely heavily on strictly registered input image pairs to produce more precise fusion results, as a way to improve the performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. In order to relax this assumption, one can attempt to register images first. However, the existing methods for registering multiple modalities have limitations, such as complex structures and reliance on significant semantic information. This paper aims to address the problem of image registration and fusion in a single framework, called BusRef. We focus on Infrared-Visible image registration and fusion task (IVRF). In this framework, the input unaligned image pairs will pass through three stages: Coarse registration, Fine registration and Fusion. It will be shown that the unified approach enables more robust IVRF. We also propose a novel training and evaluation strategy, involving the use of masks to reduce the influence of non-reconstructible regions on the loss functions, which greatly improves the accuracy and robustness of the fusion task. Last but not least, a gradient-aware fusion network is designed to preserve the complementary information. The advanced performance of this algorithm is demonstrated by

- **Summary**: Medical imaging is an essential tool for diagnosing and treating diseases. However, lacking medical images can lead to inaccurate diagnoses and ineffective treatments. Generative models offer a promising solution for addressing medical image shortage problems due to their ability to generate new data from existing datasets and detect anomalies in this data. Data augmentation with position augmentation methods like scaling, cropping, flipping, padding, rotation, and translation could lead to more overfitting in domains with little data, such as medical image data. This paper proposes the GAN-GA, a generative model optimized by embedding a genetic algorithm. The proposed model enhances image fidelity and diversity while preserving distinctive features. The proposed medical image synthesis approach improves the quality and fidelity of medical images, an essential aspect of image interpretation. To evaluate synthesized images: Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is used. The proposed GAN-GA model is tested by generating Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) medical images, an image dataset, and is the first time to be used in generative models. Our results were compared to those of InfoGAN as a baseline model. The experimental results show that the proposed optimized GAN-GA enhances FID scores by about 6.8\%, especially in earlier training epochs.

- **Summary**: We propose a new way to explain and to visualize neural network classification through a decomposition-based explainable AI (DXAI). Instead of providing an explanation heatmap, our method yields a decomposition of the image into class-agnostic and class-distinct parts, with respect to the data and chosen classifier. Following a fundamental signal processing paradigm of analysis and synthesis, the original image is the sum of the decomposed parts. We thus obtain a radically different way of explaining classification. The class-agnostic part ideally is composed of all image features which do not posses class information, where the class-distinct part is its complementary. This new visualization can be more helpful and informative in certain scenarios, especially when the attributes are dense, global and additive in nature, for instance, when colors or textures are essential for class distinction.

- **Summary**: While head-mounted devices are becoming more compact, they provide egocentric views with significant self-occlusions of the device user. Hence, existing methods often fail to accurately estimate complex 3D poses from egocentric views. In this work, we propose a new transformer-based framework to improve egocentric stereo 3D human pose estimation, which leverages the scene information and temporal context of egocentric stereo videos. Specifically, we utilize 1) depth features from our 3D scene reconstruction module with uniformly sampled windows of egocentric stereo frames, and 2) human joint queries enhanced by temporal features of the video inputs. Our method is able to accurately estimate human poses even in challenging scenarios, such as crouching and sitting. Furthermore, we introduce two new benchmark datasets, i.e., UnrealEgo2 and UnrealEgo-RW (RealWorld). The proposed datasets offer a much larger number of egocentric stereo views with a wider variety of human motions than the existing datasets, allowing comprehensive evaluation of existing and upcoming methods. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous methods. We will release UnrealEgo2, UnrealEgo-RW, and trained models on our project page.

- **Summary**: This work focuses on plant leaf disease classification and explores three crucial aspects: adversarial training, model explainability, and model compression. The models' robustness against adversarial attacks is enhanced through adversarial training, ensuring accurate classification even in the presence of threats. Leveraging explainability techniques, we gain insights into the model's decision-making process, improving trust and transparency. Additionally, we explore model compression techniques to optimize computational efficiency while maintaining classification performance. Through our experiments, we determine that on a benchmark dataset, the robustness can be the price of the classification accuracy with performance reductions of 3%-20% for regular tests and gains of 50%-70% for adversarial attack tests. We also demonstrate that a student model can be 15-25 times more computationally efficient for a slight performance reduction, distilling the knowledge of more complex models.

- **Summary**: The accuracy of 3D Human Pose and Shape reconstruction (HPS) from an image is progressively improving. Yet, no known method is robust across all image distortion. To address issues due to variations of camera poses, we introduce SHARE, a novel fine-tuning method that utilizes adversarial data augmentation to enhance the robustness of existing HPS techniques. We perform a comprehensive analysis on the impact of camera poses on HPS reconstruction outcomes. We first generated large-scale image datasets captured systematically from diverse camera perspectives. We then established a mapping between camera poses and reconstruction errors as a continuous function that characterizes the relationship between camera poses and HPS quality. Leveraging this representation, we introduce RoME (Regions of Maximal Error), a novel sampling technique for our adversarial fine-tuning method.   The SHARE framework is generalizable across various single-view HPS methods and we demonstrate its performance on HMR, SPIN, PARE, CLIFF and ExPose. Our results illustrate a reduction in mean joint errors across single-view HPS techniques, for images captured from multiple camera positions without compromising their baseline performance. In many challenging cases, our method surpasses the performance of existing models, highlighting its practical significance for diverse real-world applications.
