- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a new unified optimization algorithm for general tensor decomposition which is formulated as an inverse problem for low-rank tensors in the general linear observation models. The proposed algorithm supports three basic loss functions ($\ell_2$-loss, $\ell_1$-loss and KL divergence) and various low-rank tensor decomposition models (CP, Tucker, TT, and TR decompositions). We derive the optimization algorithm based on hierarchical combination of the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) and majorization-minimization (MM). We show that wide-range applications can be solved by the proposed algorithm, and can be easily extended to any established tensor decomposition models in a {plug-and-play} manner.

- **Summary**: A critical challenge for tumour segmentation models is the ability to adapt to diverse clinical settings, particularly when applied to poor-quality neuroimaging data. The uncertainty surrounding this adaptation stems from the lack of representative datasets, leaving top-performing models without exposure to common artifacts found in MRI data throughout Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We replicated a framework that secured the 2nd position in the 2022 BraTS competition to investigate the impact of dataset composition on model performance and pursued four distinct approaches through training a model with: 1) BraTS-Africa data only (train_SSA, N=60), 2) BraTS-Adult Glioma data only (train_GLI, N=1251), 3) both datasets together (train_ALL, N=1311), and 4) through further training the train_GLI model with BraTS-Africa data (train_ftSSA). Notably, training on a smaller low-quality dataset alone (train_SSA) yielded subpar results, and training on a larger high-quality dataset alone (train_GLI) struggled to delineate oedematous tissue in the low-quality validation set. The most promising approach (train_ftSSA) involved pre-training a model on high-quality neuroimages and then fine-tuning it on the smaller, low-quality dataset. This approach outperformed the others, ranking second in the MICCAI BraTS Africa global challenge external testing phase. These findings underscore the significance of larger sample sizes and broad exposure to data in improving segmentation performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that there is potential for improving such models by fine-tuning them with a wider range of data locally.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in numerous domains due to their high performance and accessibility to developers and application-specific end-users. Fundamental to image-based applications is the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which possess the ability to automatically extract features from data. However, comprehending these complex models and their learned representations, which typically comprise millions of parameters and numerous layers, remains a challenge for both developers and end-users. This challenge arises due to the absence of interpretable and transparent tools to make sense of black-box models. There exists a growing body of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) literature, including a collection of methods denoted Class Activation Maps (CAMs), that seek to demystify what representations the model learns from the data, how it informs a given prediction, and why it, at times, performs poorly in certain tasks. We propose a novel XAI visualization method denoted CAManim that seeks to simultaneously broaden and focus end-user understanding of CNN predictions by animating the CAM-based network activation maps through all layers, effectively depicting from end-to-end how a model progressively arrives at the final layer activation. Herein, we demonstrate that CAManim works with any CAM-based method and various CNN architectures. Beyond qualitative model assessments, we additionally propose a novel quantitative assessment that expands upon the Remove and Debias (ROAD) metric, pairing the qualitative end-to-end network visual explanations assessment with our novel quantitative "yellow brick ROAD" assessment (ybROAD). This builds upon prior research to address the increasing demand for interpretable, robust, and transparent model assessment methodology, ultimately improving an end-user's trust in a given model's predictions.

- **Summary**: By lifting the pre-trained 2D diffusion models into Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), text-to-3D generation methods have made great progress. Many state-of-the-art approaches usually apply score distillation sampling (SDS) to optimize the NeRF representations, which supervises the NeRF optimization with pre-trained text-conditioned 2D diffusion models such as Imagen. However, the supervision signal provided by such pre-trained diffusion models only depends on text prompts and does not constrain the multi-view consistency. To inject the cross-view consistency into diffusion priors, some recent works finetune the 2D diffusion model with multi-view data, but still lack fine-grained view coherence. To tackle this challenge, we incorporate multi-view image conditions into the supervision signal of NeRF optimization, which explicitly enforces fine-grained view consistency. With such stronger supervision, our proposed text-to-3D method effectively mitigates the generation of floaters (due to excessive densities) and completely empty spaces (due to insufficient densities). Our quantitative evaluations on the T$^3$Bench dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing text-to-3D methods. We will make the code publicly available.

- **Summary**: Gliomas, the most prevalent primary brain tumors, require precise segmentation for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, this task poses significant challenges, particularly in the African population, were limited access to high-quality imaging data hampers algorithm performance. In this study, we propose an innovative approach combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and a voting network for multi-modal glioma segmentation. By fine-tuning SAM with bounding box-guided prompts (SAMBA), we adapt the model to the complexities of African datasets. Our ensemble strategy, utilizing multiple modalities and views, produces a robust consensus segmentation, addressing intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Although the low quality of scans presents difficulties, our methodology has the potential to profoundly impact clinical practice in resource-limited settings such as Africa, improving treatment decisions and advancing neuro-oncology research. Furthermore, successful application to other brain tumor types and lesions in the future holds promise for a broader transformation in neurological imaging, improving healthcare outcomes across all settings. This study was conducted on the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge Africa (BraTS-Africa) dataset, which provides a valuable resource for addressing challenges specific to resource-limited settings, particularly the African population, and facilitating the development of effective and more generalizable segmentation algorithms. To illustrate our approach's potential, our experiments on the BraTS-Africa dataset yielded compelling results, with SAM attaining a Dice coefficient of 86.6 for binary segmentation and 60.4 for multi-class segmentation.

- **Summary**: Object State Changes (OSCs) are pivotal for video understanding. While humans can effortlessly generalize OSC understanding from familiar to unknown objects, current approaches are confined to a closed vocabulary. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel open-world formulation for the video OSC problem. The goal is to temporally localize the three stages of an OSC -- the object's initial state, its transitioning state, and its end state -- whether or not the object has been observed during training. Towards this end, we develop VidOSC, a holistic learning approach that: (1) leverages text and vision-language models for supervisory signals to obviate manually labeling OSC training data, and (2) abstracts fine-grained shared state representations from objects to enhance generalization. Furthermore, we present HowToChange, the first open-world benchmark for video OSC localization, which offers an order of magnitude increase in the label space and annotation volume compared to the best existing benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, in both traditional closed-world and open-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Image forensics has become increasingly important in our daily lives. As a fundamental type of forgeries, Copy-Move Forgery Detection (CMFD) has received significant attention in the academic community. Keypoint-based algorithms, particularly those based on SIFT, have achieved good results in CMFD. However, the most of keypoint detection algorithms often fail to generate sufficient matches when tampered patches are present in smooth areas. To tackle this problem, we introduce entropy images to determine the coordinates and scales of keypoints, resulting significantly increasing the number of keypoints. Furthermore, we develop an entropy level clustering algorithm to avoid increased matching complexity caused by non-ideal distribution of grayscale values in keypoints. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a good balance between performance and time efficiency.

- **Summary**: This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of Gemini models in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases and we discuss our approach toward deploying them responsibly to users.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims at linking ambiguous mentions with multimodal information to entity in Knowledge Graph (KG) such as Wikipedia, which plays a key role in many applications. However, existing methods suffer from shortcomings, including modality impurity such as noise in raw image and ambiguous textual entity representation, which puts obstacles to MEL. We formulate multimodal entity linking as a neural text matching problem where each multimodal information (text and image) is treated as a query, and the model learns the mapping from each query to the relevant entity from candidate entities. This paper introduces a dual-way enhanced (DWE) framework for MEL: (1) our model refines queries with multimodal data and addresses semantic gaps using cross-modal enhancers between text and image information. Besides, DWE innovatively leverages fine-grained image attributes, including facial characteristic and scene feature, to enhance and refine visual features. (2)By using Wikipedia descriptions, DWE enriches entity semantics and obtains more comprehensive textual representation, which reduces between textual representation and the entities in KG. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, indicating the superiority of our model.

- **Summary**: Customized text-to-image generation, which aims to learn user-specified concepts with a few images, has drawn significant attention recently. However, existing methods usually suffer from overfitting issues and entangle the subject-unrelated information (e.g., background and pose) with the learned concept, limiting the potential to compose concept into new scenes. To address these issues, we propose the DETEX, a novel approach that learns the disentangled concept embedding for flexible customized text-to-image generation. Unlike conventional methods that learn a single concept embedding from the given images, our DETEX represents each image using multiple word embeddings during training, i.e., a learnable image-shared subject embedding and several image-specific subject-unrelated embeddings. To decouple irrelevant attributes (i.e., background and pose) from the subject embedding, we further present several attribute mappers that encode each image as several image-specific subject-unrelated embeddings. To encourage these unrelated embeddings to capture the irrelevant information, we incorporate them with corresponding attribute words and propose a joint training strategy to facilitate the disentanglement. During inference, we only use the subject embedding for image generation, while selectively using image-specific embeddings to retain image-specified attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the subject embedding obtained by our method can faithfully represent the target concept, while showing superior editability compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made published available.

- **Summary**: 3D occupancy prediction is an emerging task that aims to estimate the occupancy states and semantics of 3D scenes using multi-view images. However, image-based scene perception encounters significant challenges in achieving accurate prediction due to the absence of geometric priors. In this paper, we address this issue by exploring cross-modal knowledge distillation in this task, i.e., we leverage a stronger multi-modal model to guide the visual model during training. In practice, we observe that directly applying features or logits alignment, proposed and widely used in bird's-eyeview (BEV) perception, does not yield satisfactory results. To overcome this problem, we introduce RadOcc, a Rendering assisted distillation paradigm for 3D Occupancy prediction. By employing differentiable volume rendering, we generate depth and semantic maps in perspective views and propose two novel consistency criteria between the rendered outputs of teacher and student models. Specifically, the depth consistency loss aligns the termination distributions of the rendered rays, while the semantic consistency loss mimics the intra-segment similarity guided by vision foundation models (VLMs). Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in improving various 3D occupancy prediction approaches, e.g., our proposed methodology enhances our baseline by 2.2% in the metric of mIoU and achieves 50% in Occ3D benchmark.

- **Summary**: Multi-camera perception tasks have gained significant attention in the field of autonomous driving. However, existing frameworks based on Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) in the multi-camera setting cannot produce suitable dense 3D features due to the projection nature and uncontrollable densification process. To resolve this problem, we propose to regulate intermediate dense 3D features with the help of volume rendering. Specifically, we employ volume rendering to process the dense 3D features to obtain corresponding 2D features (e.g., depth maps, semantic maps), which are supervised by associated labels in the training. This manner regulates the generation of dense 3D features on the feature level, providing appropriate dense and unified features for multiple perception tasks. Therefore, our approach is termed Vampire, stands for "Volume rendering As Multi-camera Perception Intermediate feature REgulator". Experimental results on the Occ3D and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that Vampire facilitates fine-grained and appropriate extraction of dense 3D features, and is competitive with existing SOTA methods across diverse downstream perception tasks like 3D occupancy prediction, LiDAR segmentation and 3D objection detection, while utilizing moderate GPU resources. We provide a video demonstration in the supplementary materials and Codes are available at github.com/cskkxjk/Vampire.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has emerged as a leading technique for novel view synthesis, owing to its impressive photorealistic reconstruction and rendering capability. Nevertheless, achieving real-time NeRF rendering in large-scale scenes has presented challenges, often leading to the adoption of either intricate baked mesh representations with a substantial number of triangles or resource-intensive ray marching in baked representations. We challenge these conventions, observing that high-quality geometry, represented by meshes with substantial triangles, is not necessary for achieving photorealistic rendering quality. Consequently, we propose MixRT, a novel NeRF representation that includes a low-quality mesh, a view-dependent displacement map, and a compressed NeRF model. This design effectively harnesses the capabilities of existing graphics hardware, thus enabling real-time NeRF rendering on edge devices. Leveraging a highly-optimized WebGL-based rendering framework, our proposed MixRT attains real-time rendering speeds on edge devices (over 30 FPS at a resolution of 1280 x 720 on a MacBook M1 Pro laptop), better rendering quality (0.2 PSNR higher in indoor scenes of the Unbounded-360 datasets), and a smaller storage size (less than 80% compared to state-of-the-art methods).

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel variational active contour model based on Aubert-Aujol (AA) denoising model, which hybrides geodesic active contour (GAC) model with active contours without edges (ACWE) model and can be used to segment images corrupted by multiplicative gamma noise. We transform the proposed model into classic ROF model by adding a proximity term. Inspired by a fast denosing algorithm proposed by Jia-Zhao recently, we propose two fast fixed point algorithms to solve SAR image segmentation question. Experimental results for real SAR images show that the proposed image segmentation model can efficiently stop the contours at weak or blurred edges, and can automatically detect the exterior and interior boundaries of images with multiplicative gamma noise. The proposed fast fixed point algorithms are robustness to initialization contour, and can further reduce about 15% of the time needed for algorithm proposed by Goldstein-Osher.

- **Summary**: The past few years has witnessed the dominance of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) over human motion prediction.Various styles of graph convolutions have been proposed, with each one meticulously designed and incorporated into a carefully-crafted network architecture. This paper breaks the limits of existing knowledge by proposing Universal Graph Convolution (UniGC), a novel graph convolution concept that re-conceptualizes different graph convolutions as its special cases. Leveraging UniGC on network-level, we propose GCNext, a novel GCN-building paradigm that dynamically determines the best-fitting graph convolutions both sample-wise and layer-wise. GCNext offers multiple use cases, including training a new GCN from scratch or refining a preexisting GCN. Experiments on Human3.6M, AMASS, and 3DPW datasets show that, by incorporating unique module-to-network designs, GCNext yields up to 9x lower computational cost than existing GCN methods, on top of achieving state-of-the-art performance.



### Self-supervised Learning for Enhancing Geometrical Modeling in 3D-Aware Generative Adversarial Network

- **Summary**: 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (3D-GANs) currently exhibit artifacts in their 3D geometrical modeling, such as mesh imperfections and holes. These shortcomings are primarily attributed to the limited availability of annotated 3D data, leading to a constrained "valid latent area" for satisfactory modeling. To address this, we present a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) technique tailored as an auxiliary loss for any 3D-GAN, designed to improve its 3D geometrical modeling capabilities. Our approach pioneers an inversion technique for 3D-GANs, integrating an encoder that performs adaptive spatially-varying range operations. Utilizing this inversion, we introduce the Cyclic Generative Constraint (CGC), aiming to densify the valid latent space. The CGC operates via augmented local latent vectors that maintain the same geometric form, and it imposes constraints on the cycle path outputs, specifically the generator-encoder-generator sequence. This SSL methodology seamlessly integrates with the inherent GAN loss, ensuring the integrity of pre-existing 3D-GAN architectures without necessitating alterations. We validate our approach with comprehensive experiments across various datasets and architectures, underscoring its efficacy. Our project website: https://3dgan-ssl.github.io

- **Summary**: Due to their ability to model meaningful higher order relations among a set of entities, higher order network models have emerged recently as a powerful alternative for graph-based network models which are only capable of modeling binary relationships. Message passing paradigm is still dominantly used to learn representations even for higher order network models. While powerful, message passing can have disadvantages during inference, particularly when the higher order connectivity information is missing or corrupted. To overcome such limitations, we propose Topo-MLP, a purely MLP-based simplicial neural network algorithm to learn the representation of elements in a simplicial complex without explicitly relying on message passing. Our framework utilizes a novel Higher Order Neighborhood Contrastive (HONC) loss which implicitly incorporates the simplicial structure into representation learning. Our proposed model's simplicity makes it faster during inference. Moreover, we show that our model is robust when faced with missing or corrupted connectivity structure.

- **Summary**: Ideal part editing should guarantee the diversity of edited parts, the fidelity to the remaining parts, and the quality of the results. However, previous methods do not disentangle each part completely, which means the edited parts will affect the others, resulting in poor diversity and fidelity. In addition, some methods lack constraints between parts, which need manual selections of edited results to ensure quality. Therefore, we propose a four-stage process for point cloud part editing: Segmentation, Generation, Assembly, and Selection. Based on this process, we introduce SGAS, a model for part editing that employs two strategies: feature disentanglement and constraint. By independently fitting part-level feature distributions, we realize the feature disentanglement. By explicitly modeling the transformation from object-level distribution to part-level distributions, we realize the feature constraint. Considerable experiments on different datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SGAS on point cloud part editing. In addition, SGAS can be pruned to realize unsupervised part-aware point cloud generation and achieves state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: One of the ultimate goals of representation learning is to achieve compactness within a class and well-separability between classes. Many outstanding metric-based and prototype-based methods following the Expectation-Maximization paradigm, have been proposed for this objective. However, they inevitably introduce biases into the learning process, particularly with long-tail distributed training data. In this paper, we reveal that the class prototype is not necessarily to be derived from training features and propose a novel perspective to use pre-defined class anchors serving as feature centroid to unidirectionally guide feature learning. However, the pre-defined anchors may have a large semantic distance from the pixel features, which prevents them from being directly applied. To address this issue and generate feature centroid independent from feature learning, a simple yet effective Semantic Anchor Regularization (SAR) is proposed. SAR ensures the interclass separability of semantic anchors in the semantic space by employing a classifier-aware auxiliary cross-entropy loss during training via disentanglement learning. By pulling the learned features to these semantic anchors, several advantages can be attained: 1) the intra-class compactness and naturally inter-class separability, 2) induced bias or errors from feature learning can be avoided, and 3) robustness to the long-tailed problem. The proposed SAR can be used in a plug-and-play manner in the existing models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SAR performs better than previous sophisticated prototype-based methods.

- **Summary**: Urban environments are characterized by complex structures and diverse features, making accurate segmentation of point cloud data a challenging task. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the application of RandLA-Net, a state-of-the-art neural network architecture, for the 3D segmentation of large-scale point cloud data in urban areas. The study focuses on three major Chinese cities, namely Chengdu, Jiaoda, and Shenzhen, leveraging their unique characteristics to enhance segmentation performance.   To address the limited availability of labeled data for these specific urban areas, we employed transfer learning techniques. We transferred the learned weights from the Sensat Urban and Toronto 3D datasets to initialize our RandLA-Net model. Additionally, we performed class remapping to adapt the model to the target urban areas, ensuring accurate segmentation results.   The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach achieving over 80\% F1 score for each areas in 3D point cloud segmentation. The transfer learning strategy proves to be crucial in overcoming data scarcity issues, providing a robust solution for urban point cloud analysis. The findings contribute to the advancement of point cloud segmentation methods, especially in the context of rapidly evolving Chinese urban areas.

- **Summary**: The lifting of 3D structure and camera from 2D landmarks is at the cornerstone of the entire discipline of computer vision. Traditional methods have been confined to specific rigid objects, such as those in Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problems, but deep learning has expanded our capability to reconstruct a wide range of object classes (e.g. C3PDO and PAUL) with resilience to noise, occlusions, and perspective distortions. All these techniques, however, have been limited by the fundamental need to establish correspondences across the 3D training data -- significantly limiting their utility to applications where one has an abundance of "in-correspondence" 3D data. Our approach harnesses the inherent permutation equivariance of transformers to manage varying number of points per 3D data instance, withstands occlusions, and generalizes to unseen categories. We demonstrate state of the art performance across 2D-3D lifting task benchmarks. Since our approach can be trained across such a broad class of structures we refer to it simply as a 3D Lifting Foundation Model (3D-LFM) -- the first of its kind.

- **Summary**: Videos are highly redundant data source and it is often enough to identify a few key moments to solve any given task. In this paper, we present a text-conditioned video resampler (TCR) module that uses a pre-trained and frozen visual encoder and large language model (LLM) to process long video sequences for a task. TCR localises relevant visual features from the video given a text condition and provides them to a LLM to generate a text response. Due to its lightweight design and use of cross-attention, TCR can process more than 100 frames at a time allowing the model to use much longer chunks of video than earlier works. We make the following contributions: (i) we design a transformer-based sampling architecture that can process long videos conditioned on a task, together with a training method that enables it to bridge pre-trained visual and language models; (ii) we empirically validate its efficacy on a wide variety of evaluation tasks, and set a new state-of-the-art on NextQA, EgoSchema, and the EGO4D-LTA challenge; and (iii) we determine tasks which require longer video contexts and that can thus be used effectively for further evaluation of long-range video models.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative AI have significantly enhanced image and video editing, particularly in the context of text prompt control. State-of-the-art approaches predominantly rely on diffusion models to accomplish these tasks. However, the computational demands of diffusion-based methods are substantial, often necessitating large-scale paired datasets for training, and therefore challenging the deployment in practical applications. This study addresses this challenge by breaking down the text-based video editing process into two separate stages. In the first stage, we leverage an existing text-to-image diffusion model to simultaneously edit a few keyframes without additional fine-tuning. In the second stage, we introduce an efficient model called MaskINT, which is built on non-autoregressive masked generative transformers and specializes in frame interpolation between the keyframes, benefiting from structural guidance provided by intermediate frames. Our comprehensive set of experiments illustrates the efficacy and efficiency of MaskINT when compared to other diffusion-based methodologies. This research offers a practical solution for text-based video editing and showcases the potential of non-autoregressive masked generative transformers in this domain.

- **Summary**: Event cameras are bio-inspired, motion-activated sensors that demonstrate substantial potential in handling challenging situations, such as motion blur and high-dynamic range. In this paper, we proposed EVI-SAM to tackle the problem of 6 DoF pose tracking and 3D reconstruction using monocular event camera. A novel event-based hybrid tracking framework is designed to estimate the pose, leveraging the robustness of feature matching and the precision of direct alignment. Specifically, we develop an event-based 2D-2D alignment to construct the photometric constraint, and tightly integrate it with the event-based reprojection constraint. The mapping module recovers the dense and colorful depth of the scene through the image-guided event-based mapping method. Subsequently, the appearance, texture, and surface mesh of the 3D scene can be reconstructed by fusing the dense depth map from multiple viewpoints using truncated signed distance function (TSDF) fusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-learning work to realize event-based dense mapping. Numerical evaluations are performed on both publicly available and self-collected datasets, which qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Our EVI-SAM effectively balances accuracy and robustness while maintaining computational efficiency, showcasing superior pose tracking and dense mapping performance in challenging scenarios.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, scene text recognition has attracted more and more attention due to its diverse applications. Most state-of-the-art methods adopt an encoder-decoder framework with the attention mechanism, autoregressively generating text from left to right. Despite the convincing performance, this sequential decoding strategy constrains inference speed. Conversely, non-autoregressive models provide faster, simultaneous predictions but often sacrifice accuracy. Although utilizing an explicit language model can improve performance, it burdens the computational load. Besides, separating linguistic knowledge from vision information may harm the final prediction. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution, using a parallel and iterative decoder that adopts an easy-first decoding strategy. Furthermore, we regard text recognition as an image-based conditional text generation task and utilize the discrete diffusion strategy, ensuring exhaustive exploration of bidirectional contextual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior results on the benchmark datasets, including both Chinese and English text images.

- **Summary**: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) is a new challenge that combines computer vision and natural language processing, delineating specific regions in aerial images as described by textual queries. Traditional Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) approaches have been impeded by the complex spatial scales and orientations found in aerial imagery, leading to suboptimal segmentation results. To address these challenges, we introduce the Rotated Multi-Scale Interaction Network (RMSIN), an innovative approach designed for the unique demands of RRSIS. RMSIN incorporates an Intra-scale Interaction Module (IIM) to effectively address the fine-grained detail required at multiple scales and a Cross-scale Interaction Module (CIM) for integrating these details coherently across the network. Furthermore, RMSIN employs an Adaptive Rotated Convolution (ARC) to account for the diverse orientations of objects, a novel contribution that significantly enhances segmentation accuracy. To assess the efficacy of RMSIN, we have curated an expansive dataset comprising 17,402 image-caption-mask triplets, which is unparalleled in terms of scale and variety. This dataset not only presents the model with a wide range of spatial and rotational scenarios but also establishes a stringent benchmark for the RRSIS task, ensuring a rigorous evaluation of performance. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the exceptional performance of RMSIN, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models by a significant margin. All datasets and code are made available at https://github.com/Lsan2401/RMSIN.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking (MOT) has profound applications in a variety of fields, including surveillance, sports analytics, self-driving, and cooperative robotics. Despite considerable advancements, existing MOT methodologies tend to falter when faced with non-uniform movements, occlusions, and appearance-reappearance scenarios of the objects. Recognizing this inadequacy, we put forward an integrated MOT method that not only marries object detection and identity linkage within a singular, end-to-end trainable framework but also equips the model with the ability to maintain object identity links over long periods of time. Our proposed model, named STMMOT, is built around four key modules: 1) candidate proposal generation, which generates object proposals via a vision-transformer encoder-decoder architecture that detects the object from each frame in the video; 2) scale variant pyramid, a progressive pyramid structure to learn the self-scale and cross-scale similarities in multi-scale feature maps; 3) spatio-temporal memory encoder, extracting the essential information from the memory associated with each object under tracking; and 4) spatio-temporal memory decoder, simultaneously resolving the tasks of object detection and identity association for MOT. Our system leverages a robust spatio-temporal memory module that retains extensive historical observations and effectively encodes them using an attention-based aggregator. The uniqueness of STMMOT lies in representing objects as dynamic query embeddings that are updated continuously, which enables the prediction of object states with attention mechanisms and eradicates the need for post-processing.

- **Summary**: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and masked image modeling, have been proposed to acquire powerful and general representations from unlabeled data. However, these models are commonly pretrained within their specific framework alone, failing to consider the complementary nature of visual representations. To tackle this issue, we introduce Comprehensive Distillation with Multiple Self-supervised Teachers (DMT) for pretrained model compression, which leverages the strengths of multiple off-the-shelf self-supervised models. Our experimental results on prominent benchmark datasets exhibit that the proposed method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art competitors while retaining favorable efficiency metrics. On classification tasks, our DMT framework utilizing three different self-supervised ViT-Base teachers enhances the performance of both small/tiny models and the base model itself. For dense tasks, DMT elevates the AP/mIoU of standard SSL models on MS-COCO and ADE20K datasets by 4.0%.

- **Summary**: Data mixing augmentation has been widely applied to improve the generalization ability of deep neural networks. Recently, offline data mixing augmentation, e.g. handcrafted and saliency information-based mixup, has been gradually replaced by automatic mixing approaches. Through minimizing two sub-tasks, namely, mixed sample generation and mixup classification in an end-to-end way, AutoMix significantly improves accuracy on image classification tasks. However, as the optimization objective is consistent for the two sub-tasks, this approach is prone to generating consistent instead of diverse mixed samples, which results in overfitting for target task training. In this paper, we propose AdAutomixup, an adversarial automatic mixup augmentation approach that generates challenging samples to train a robust classifier for image classification, by alternatively optimizing the classifier and the mixup sample generator. AdAutomixup comprises two modules, a mixed example generator, and a target classifier. The mixed sample generator aims to produce hard mixed examples to challenge the target classifier while the target classifier`s aim is to learn robust features from hard mixed examples to improve generalization. To prevent the collapse of the inherent meanings of images, we further introduce an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher and cosine similarity to train AdAutomixup in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on seven image benchmarks consistently prove that our approach outperforms the state of the art in various classification scenarios.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation has experienced significant progress on terrestrial images in recent years, largely due to deep learning advancements. However, it remains inadequate for underwater scenes, primarily because of data scarcity. Given the inherent challenges of light attenuation and backscattering in water, acquiring clear underwater images or precise depth information is notably difficult and costly. Consequently, learning-based approaches often rely on synthetic data or turn to unsupervised or self-supervised methods to mitigate this lack of data. Nonetheless, the performance of these methods is often constrained by the domain gap and looser constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for generating photorealistic underwater images using accurate terrestrial depth data. This approach facilitates the training of supervised models for underwater depth estimation, effectively reducing the performance disparity between terrestrial and underwater environments. Contrary to prior synthetic datasets that merely apply style transfer to terrestrial images without altering the scene content, our approach uniquely creates vibrant, non-existent underwater scenes by leveraging terrestrial depth data through the innovative Stable Diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a unique Depth2Underwater ControlNet, trained on specially prepared \{Underwater, Depth, Text\} data triplets, for this generation task. Our newly developed dataset enables terrestrial depth estimation models to achieve considerable improvements, both quantitatively and qualitatively, on unseen underwater images, surpassing their terrestrial pre-trained counterparts. Moreover, the enhanced depth accuracy for underwater scenes also aids underwater image restoration techniques that rely on depth maps, further demonstrating our dataset's utility. The dataset will be available at https://github.com/zkawfanx/Atlantis.

- **Summary**: Visual grounding (VG) aims to locate a specific target in an image based on a given language query. The discriminative information from context is important for distinguishing the target from other objects, particularly for the targets that have the same category as others. However, most previous methods underestimate such information. Moreover, they are usually designed for the standard scene (without any novel object), which limits their generalization to the open-vocabulary scene. In this paper, we propose a novel framework with context disentangling and prototype inheriting for robust visual grounding to handle both scenes. Specifically, the context disentangling disentangles the referent and context features, which achieves better discrimination between them. The prototype inheriting inherits the prototypes discovered from the disentangled visual features by a prototype bank to fully utilize the seen data, especially for the open-vocabulary scene. The fused features, obtained by leveraging Hadamard product on disentangled linguistic and visual features of prototypes to avoid sharp adjusting the importance between the two types of features, are then attached with a special token and feed to a vision Transformer encoder for bounding box regression. Extensive experiments are conducted on both standard and open-vocabulary scenes. The performance comparisons indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both scenarios. {The code is available at https://github.com/WayneTomas/TransCP.

- **Summary**: Human motion forecasting, with the goal of estimating future human behavior over a period of time, is a fundamental task in many real-world applications. However, existing works typically concentrate on predicting the major joints of the human body without considering the delicate movements of the human hands. In practical applications, hand gesture plays an important role in human communication with the real world, and expresses the primary intention of human beings. In this work, we are the first to formulate a whole-body human pose forecasting task, which jointly predicts the future body and hand activities. Correspondingly, we propose a novel Encoding-Alignment-Interaction (EAI) framework that aims to predict both coarse (body joints) and fine-grained (gestures) activities collaboratively, enabling expressive and cross-facilitated forecasting of 3D whole-body human motions. Specifically, our model involves two key constituents: cross-context alignment (XCA) and cross-context interaction (XCI). Considering the heterogeneous information within the whole-body, XCA aims to align the latent features of various human components, while XCI focuses on effectively capturing the context interaction among the human components. We conduct extensive experiments on a newly-introduced large-scale benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance. The code is public for research purposes at https://github.com/Dingpx/EAI.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the Regularized Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (RLTH), which highlights the presence of competitive subnetworks within dense networks for continual learning tasks, we introduce Winning Subnetworks (WSN). This approach utilizes reused weights in dense networks to enhance learning in Task Incremental Learning (TIL) scenarios. To mitigate overfitting in Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL), we have developed WSN variants referred to as the Soft subnetwork (SoftNet). Furthermore, addressing WSN's limitation of sparse reused weights in Video Incremental Learning (VIL), we propose the Fourier Subneural Operator (FSO). The FSO, operating in Fourier space, adaptively and compactly encodes videos, discovering reusable subnetworks with diverse bandwidths. We have applied FSO's Fourier representations to various continual learning contexts, including VIL, TIL, and FSCIL. Our extensive experiments across these scenarios demonstrate FSO's remarkable efficacy in continual learning, significantly enhancing task performance at various convolutional representational levels: it boosts performance in the higher layers for TIL and FSCIL and the lower layers for VIL.

- **Summary**: We propose Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), a new method that effectively leverages existing motion diffusion models as motion priors for a wide range of motion-related tasks. Instead of training a task-specific diffusion model for each new task, DNO operates by optimizing the diffusion latent noise of an existing pre-trained text-to-motion model. Given the corresponding latent noise of a human motion, it propagates the gradient from the target criteria defined on the motion space through the whole denoising process to update the diffusion latent noise. As a result, DNO supports any use cases where criteria can be defined as a function of motion. In particular, we show that, for motion editing and control, DNO outperforms existing methods in both achieving the objective and preserving the motion content. DNO accommodates a diverse range of editing modes, including changing trajectory, pose, joint locations, or avoiding newly added obstacles. In addition, DNO is effective in motion denoising and completion, producing smooth and realistic motion from noisy and partial inputs. DNO achieves these results at inference time without the need for model retraining, offering great versatility for any defined reward or loss function on the motion representation.

- **Summary**: For object detection, it is possible to view the prediction of bounding boxes as a reverse diffusion process. Using a diffusion model, the random bounding boxes are iteratively refined in a denoising step, conditioned on the image. We propose a stochastic accumulator function that starts each run with random bounding boxes and combines the slightly different predictions. We empirically verify that this improves detection performance. The improved detections are leveraged on unlabelled images as weighted pseudo-labels for semi-supervised learning. We evaluate the method on a challenging out-of-domain test set. Our method brings significant improvements and is on par with human-selected pseudo-labels, while not requiring any human involvement.

- **Summary**: Laparoscopic surgery offers minimally invasive procedures with better patient outcomes, but smoke presence challenges visibility and safety. Existing learning-based methods demand large datasets and high computational resources. We propose the Progressive Frequency-Aware Network (PFAN), a lightweight GAN framework for laparoscopic image desmoking, combining the strengths of CNN and Transformer for progressive information extraction in the frequency domain. PFAN features CNN-based Multi-scale Bottleneck-Inverting (MBI) Blocks for capturing local high-frequency information and Locally-Enhanced Axial Attention Transformers (LAT) for efficiently handling global low-frequency information. PFAN efficiently desmokes laparoscopic images even with limited training data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in PSNR, SSIM, CIEDE2000, and visual quality on the Cholec80 dataset and retains only 629K parameters. Our code and models are made publicly available at: https://github.com/jlzcode/PFAN.

- **Summary**: Synthesis of same-identity biometric iris images, both for existing and non-existing identities while preserving the identity across a wide range of pupil sizes, is complex due to intricate iris muscle constriction mechanism, requiring a precise model of iris non-linear texture deformations to be embedded into the synthesis pipeline. This paper presents the first method of fully data-driven, identity-preserving, pupil size-varying s ynthesis of iris images. This approach is capable of synthesizing images of irises with different pupil sizes representing non-existing identities as well as non-linearly deforming the texture of iris images of existing subjects given the segmentation mask of the target iris image. Iris recognition experiments suggest that the proposed deformation model not only preserves the identity when changing the pupil size but offers better similarity between same-identity iris samples with significant differences in pupil size, compared to state-of-the-art linear and non-linear (bio-mechanical-based) iris deformation models. Two immediate applications of the proposed approach are: (a) synthesis of, or enhancement of the existing biometric datasets for iris recognition, mimicking those acquired with iris sensors, and (b) helping forensic human experts in examining iris image pairs with significant differences in pupil dilation. Source codes and weights of the models are made available with the paper.

- **Summary**: Training-free guided sampling in diffusion models leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained networks, such as an aesthetic evaluation model, to guide the generation process. Current training-free guided sampling algorithms obtain the guidance energy function based on a one-step estimate of the clean image. However, since the off-the-shelf pre-trained networks are trained on clean images, the one-step estimation procedure of the clean image may be inaccurate, especially in the early stages of the generation process in diffusion models. This causes the guidance in the early time steps to be inaccurate. To overcome this problem, we propose Symplectic Adjoint Guidance (SAG), which calculates the gradient guidance in two inner stages. Firstly, SAG estimates the clean image via $n$ function calls, where $n$ serves as a flexible hyperparameter that can be tailored to meet specific image quality requirements. Secondly, SAG uses the symplectic adjoint method to obtain the gradients accurately and efficiently in terms of the memory requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAG generates images with higher qualities compared to the baselines in both guided image and video generation tasks.

- **Summary**: While generating realistic body movements, e.g., for avatars in virtual reality, is widely studied in computer vision and graphics, the generation of eye movements that exhibit realistic coordination with the body remains under-explored. We first report a comprehensive analysis of the coordination of human eye and full-body movements during everyday activities based on data from the MoGaze and GIMO datasets. We show that eye gaze has strong correlations with head directions and also full-body motions and there exists a noticeable time delay between body and eye movements. Inspired by the analyses, we then present Pose2Gaze -- a novel eye-body coordination model that first uses a convolutional neural network and a spatio-temporal graph convolutional neural network to extract features from head directions and full-body poses respectively and then applies a convolutional neural network to generate realistic eye movements. We compare our method with state-of-the-art methods that predict eye gaze only from head movements for three different generation tasks and demonstrate that Pose2Gaze significantly outperforms these baselines on both datasets with an average improvement of 26.4% and 21.6% in mean angular error, respectively. Our findings underline the significant potential of cross-modal human gaze behaviour analysis and modelling.

- **Summary**: Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras are becoming popular in a wide span of areas ranging from consumer-grade electronic devices to safety-critical industrial robots. This is mainly due to their high frame rate, relative good precision and the lowered costs. Although ToF cameras are in continuous development, especially pulse-based variants, they still face different problems, including spurious noise over the points or multipath inference (MPI). The latter can cause deformed surfaces to manifest themselves on curved surfaces instead of planar ones, making standard spatial data preprocessing, such as plane extraction, difficult. In this paper, we focus on the MPI reduction problem using Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) which allow the mitigation of this type of artifact for pulse-based ToF cameras. With our end-to-end network, we managed to attenuate the MPI effect on planar surfaces using a learning-based method on real ToF data. Both the custom dataset used for our model training as well as the code is available on the author's Github homepage.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have exhibited great performance in discriminative feature learning for complex visual tasks. Besides discrimination power, interpretability is another important yet under-explored property for CNNs. One difficulty in the CNN interpretability is that filters and image classes are entangled. In this paper, we introduce a novel pathway to alleviate the entanglement between filters and image classes. The proposed pathway groups the filters in a late conv-layer of CNN into class-specific clusters. Clusters and classes are in a one-to-one relationship. Specifically, we use the Bernoulli sampling to generate the filter-cluster assignment matrix from a learnable filter-class correspondence matrix. To enable end-to-end optimization, we develop a novel reparameterization trick for handling the non-differentiable Bernoulli sampling. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on ten widely used network architectures (including nine CNNs and a ViT) and five benchmark datasets. Experimental results have demonstrated that our method PICNN (the combination of standard CNNs with our proposed pathway) exhibits greater interpretability than standard CNNs while achieving higher or comparable discrimination power.

- **Summary**: How to frame (or crop) a photo often depends on the image subject and its context; e.g., a human portrait. Recent works have defined the subject-aware image cropping task as a nuanced and practical version of image cropping. We propose a weakly-supervised approach (GenCrop) to learn what makes a high-quality, subject-aware crop from professional stock images. Unlike supervised prior work, GenCrop requires no new manual annotations beyond the existing stock image collection. The key challenge in learning from this data, however, is that the images are already cropped and we do not know what regions were removed. Our insight is combine a library of stock images with a modern, pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. The stock image collection provides diversity and its images serve as pseudo-labels for a good crop, while the text-image diffusion model is used to out-paint (i.e., outward inpainting) realistic uncropped images. Using this procedure, we are able to automatically generate a large dataset of cropped-uncropped training pairs to train a cropping model. Despite being weakly-supervised, GenCrop is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised methods and significantly better than comparable weakly-supervised baselines on quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Human motion prediction is important for virtual reality (VR) applications, e.g., for realistic avatar animation. Existing methods have synthesised body motion only from observed past motion, despite the fact that human gaze is known to correlate strongly with body movements and is readily available in recent VR headsets. We present GazeMoDiff -- a novel gaze-guided denoising diffusion model to generate stochastic human motions. Our method first uses a graph attention network to learn the spatio-temporal correlations between eye gaze and human movements and to fuse them into cross-modal gaze-motion features. These cross-modal features are injected into a noise prediction network via a cross-attention mechanism and progressively denoised to generate realistic human full-body motions. Experimental results on the MoGaze and GIMO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in terms of average displacement error (15.03% on MoGaze and 9.20% on GIMO). We further conducted an online user study to compare our method with state-of-the-art methods and the responses from 23 participants validate that the motions generated by our method are more realistic than those from other methods. Taken together, our work makes a first important step towards gaze-guided stochastic human motion prediction and guides future work on this important topic in VR research.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing a dynamic human with loose clothing is an important but difficult task. To address this challenge, we propose a method named DLCA-Recon to create human avatars from monocular videos. The distance from loose clothing to the underlying body rapidly changes in every frame when the human freely moves and acts. Previous methods lack effective geometric initialization and constraints for guiding the optimization of deformation to explain this dramatic change, resulting in the discontinuous and incomplete reconstruction surface. To model the deformation more accurately, we propose to initialize an estimated 3D clothed human in the canonical space, as it is easier for deformation fields to learn from the clothed human than from SMPL. With both representations of explicit mesh and implicit SDF, we utilize the physical connection information between consecutive frames and propose a dynamic deformation field (DDF) to optimize deformation fields. DDF accounts for contributive forces on loose clothing to enhance the interpretability of deformations and effectively capture the free movement of loose clothing. Moreover, we propagate SMPL skinning weights to each individual and refine pose and skinning weights during the optimization to improve skinning transformation. Based on more reasonable initialization and DDF, we can simulate real-world physics more accurately. Extensive experiments on public and our own datasets validate that our method can produce superior results for humans with loose clothing compared to the SOTA methods.

- **Summary**: While significant progress has been achieved in LiDAR-based perception, domain generalization continues to present challenges, often resulting in reduced performance when encountering unfamiliar datasets due to domain discrepancies. One of the primary hurdles stems from the variability of LiDAR sensors, leading to inconsistencies in point cloud density distribution. Such inconsistencies can undermine the effectiveness of perception models. We address this challenge by introducing a new approach that acknowledges a fundamental characteristic of LiDAR: the variation in point density due to the distance from the LiDAR to the scene, and the number of beams relative to the field of view. Understanding this, we view each LiDAR's point cloud at various distances as having distinct density distributions, which can be consistent across different LiDAR models. With this insight, we propose the Density Discriminative Feature Embedding (DDFE) module, crafted to specifically extract features related to density while ensuring domain invariance across different LiDAR sensors. In addition, we introduce a straightforward but effective density augmentation technique, designed to broaden the density spectrum and enhance the capabilities of the DDFE. The proposed DDFE stands out as a versatile and lightweight domain generalization module. It can be seamlessly integrated into various 3D backbone networks, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches. We commit to releasing the source code publicly to foster community collaboration and advancement.

- **Summary**: Effectively explaining decisions of black-box machine learning models is critical to responsible deployment of AI systems that rely on them. Recognizing their importance, the field of explainable AI (XAI) provides several techniques to generate these explanations. Yet, there is relatively little emphasis on the user (the explainee) in this growing body of work and most XAI techniques generate "one-size-fits-all" explanations. To bridge this gap and achieve a step closer towards human-centered XAI, we present I-CEE, a framework that provides Image Classification Explanations tailored to User Expertise. Informed by existing work, I-CEE explains the decisions of image classification models by providing the user with an informative subset of training data (i.e., example images), corresponding local explanations, and model decisions. However, unlike prior work, I-CEE models the informativeness of the example images to depend on user expertise, resulting in different examples for different users. We posit that by tailoring the example set to user expertise, I-CEE can better facilitate users' understanding and simulatability of the model. To evaluate our approach, we conduct detailed experiments in both simulation and with human participants (N = 100) on multiple datasets. Experiments with simulated users show that I-CEE improves users' ability to accurately predict the model's decisions (simulatability) compared to baselines, providing promising preliminary results. Experiments with human participants demonstrate that our method significantly improves user simulatability accuracy, highlighting the importance of human-centered XAI

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved great success in the task of synthesizing novel views that preserve the same resolution as the training views. However, it is challenging for NeRF to synthesize high-quality high-resolution novel views with low-resolution training data. To solve this problem, we propose a zero-shot super-resolution training framework for NeRF. This framework aims to guide the NeRF model to synthesize high-resolution novel views via single-scene internal learning rather than requiring any external high-resolution training data. Our approach consists of two stages. First, we learn a scene-specific degradation mapping by performing internal learning on a pretrained low-resolution coarse NeRF. Second, we optimize a super-resolution fine NeRF by conducting inverse rendering with our mapping function so as to backpropagate the gradients from low-resolution 2D space into the super-resolution 3D sampling space. Then, we further introduce a temporal ensemble strategy in the inference phase to compensate for the scene estimation errors. Our method is featured on two points: (1) it does not consume high-resolution views or additional scene data to train super-resolution NeRF; (2) it can speed up the training process by adopting a coarse-to-fine strategy. By conducting extensive experiments on public datasets, we have qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Single-domain generalization (S-DG) aims to generalize a model to unseen environments with a single-source domain. However, most S-DG approaches have been conducted in the field of classification. When these approaches are applied to object detection, the semantic features of some objects can be damaged, which can lead to imprecise object localization and misclassification. To address these problems, we propose an object-aware domain generalization (OA-DG) method for single-domain generalization in object detection. Our method consists of data augmentation and training strategy, which are called OA-Mix and OA-Loss, respectively. OA-Mix generates multi-domain data with multi-level transformation and object-aware mixing strategy. OA-Loss enables models to learn domain-invariant representations for objects and backgrounds from the original and OA-Mixed images. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art works on standard benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/WoojuLee24/OA-DG.

- **Summary**: In the era of digital medicine, medical imaging serves as a widespread technique for early disease detection, with a substantial volume of images being generated and stored daily in electronic patient records. X-ray angiography imaging is a standard and one of the most common methods for rapidly diagnosing coronary artery diseases. The notable achievements of recent deep learning algorithms align with the increased use of electronic health records and diagnostic imaging. Deep neural networks, leveraging abundant data, advanced algorithms, and powerful computational capabilities, prove highly effective in the analysis and interpretation of images. In this context, Object detection methods have become a promising approach, particularly through convolutional neural networks (CNN), streamlining medical image analysis by eliminating manual feature extraction. This allows for direct feature extraction from images, ensuring high accuracy in results. Therefore, in our paper, we utilized the object detection method on X-ray angiography images to precisely identify the location of coronary artery stenosis. As a result, this model enables automatic and real-time detection of stenosis locations, assisting in the crucial and sensitive decision-making process for healthcare professionals.

- **Summary**: Automatic font generation is an imitation task, which aims to create a font library that mimics the style of reference images while preserving the content from source images. Although existing font generation methods have achieved satisfactory performance, they still struggle with complex characters and large style variations. To address these issues, we propose FontDiffuser, a diffusion-based image-to-image one-shot font generation method, which innovatively models the font imitation task as a noise-to-denoise paradigm. In our method, we introduce a Multi-scale Content Aggregation (MCA) block, which effectively combines global and local content cues across different scales, leading to enhanced preservation of intricate strokes of complex characters. Moreover, to better manage the large variations in style transfer, we propose a Style Contrastive Refinement (SCR) module, which is a novel structure for style representation learning. It utilizes a style extractor to disentangle styles from images, subsequently supervising the diffusion model via a meticulously designed style contrastive loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate FontDiffuser's state-of-the-art performance in generating diverse characters and styles. It consistently excels on complex characters and large style changes compared to previous methods. The code is available at https://github.com/yeungchenwa/FontDiffuser.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an novel methodology aimed at simulating the learning phenomenon of nystagmus through the application of differential blurring on datasets. Nystagmus is a biological phenomenon that influences human vision throughout life, notably by diminishing head shake from infancy to adulthood. Leveraging this concept, we address the issue of waste classification, a pressing global concern. The proposed framework comprises two modules, with the second module closely resembling the original Vision Transformer, a state-of-the-art model model in classification tasks. The primary motivation behind our approach is to enhance the model's precision and adaptability, mirroring the real-world conditions that the human visual system undergoes. This novel methodology surpasses the standard Vision Transformer model in waste classification tasks, exhibiting an improvement with a margin of 2%. This improvement underscores the potential of our methodology in improving model precision by drawing inspiration from human vision perception. Further research in the proposed methodology could yield greater performance results, and can be extrapolated to other global issues.

- **Summary**: 3D perception is a critical problem in autonomous driving. Recently, the Bird-Eye-View (BEV) approach has attracted extensive attention, due to low-cost deployment and desirable vision detection capacity. However, the existing models ignore a realistic scenario during the driving procedure, i.e., one or more view cameras may be failed, which largely deteriorates the performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a generic Masked BEV (M-BEV) perception framework, which can effectively improve robustness to this challenging scenario, by random masking and reconstructing camera views in the end-to-end training. More specifically, we develop a novel Masked View Reconstruction (MVR) module for M-BEV. It mimics various missing cases by randomly masking features of different camera views, then leverages the original features of these views as self-supervision, and reconstructs the masked ones with the distinct spatio-temporal context across views. Via such a plug-and-play MVR, our M-BEV is capable of learning the missing views from the resting ones, and thus well generalized for robust view recovery and accurate perception in the testing. We perform extensive experiments on the popular NuScenes benchmark, where our framework can significantly boost 3D perception performance of the state-of-the-art models on various missing view cases, e.g., for the absence of back view, our M-BEV promotes the PETRv2 model with 10.3% mAP gain.

- **Summary**: Detecting and classifying cells in histopathology H\&E stained whole-slide images is a core task in computational pathology, as it provides valuable insight into the tumor microenvironment. In this work we investigate the impact of ground truth formats on the models performance. Additionally, cell-tissue interactions are considered by providing tissue segmentation predictions as input to the cell detection model. We find that a "soft", probability-map instance segmentation ground truth leads to best model performance. Combined with cell-tissue interaction and test-time augmentation our Soft Cell-Tissue-Model (SoftCTM) achieves 0.7172 mean F1-Score on the Overlapped Cell On Tissue (OCELOT) test set, achieving the third best overall score in the OCELOT 2023 Challenge.

- **Summary**: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve temporal segments in untrimmed videos corresponding to a given language query by constructing cross-modal alignment strategies. However, these existing strategies are often sub-optimal since they ignore the modality imbalance problem, \textit{i.e.}, the semantic richness inherent in videos far exceeds that of a given limited-length sentence. Therefore, in pursuit of better alignment, a natural idea is enhancing the video modality to filter out query-irrelevant semantics, and enhancing the text modality to capture more segment-relevant knowledge. In this paper, we introduce Modal-Enhanced Semantic Modeling (MESM), a novel framework for more balanced alignment through enhancing features at two levels. First, we enhance the video modality at the frame-word level through word reconstruction. This strategy emphasizes the portions associated with query words in frame-level features while suppressing irrelevant parts. Therefore, the enhanced video contains less redundant semantics and is more balanced with the textual modality. Second, we enhance the textual modality at the segment-sentence level by learning complementary knowledge from context sentences and ground-truth segments. With the knowledge added to the query, the textual modality thus maintains more meaningful semantics and is more balanced with the video modality. By implementing two levels of MESM, the semantic information from both modalities is more balanced to align, thereby bridging the modality gap. Experiments on three widely used benchmarks, including the out-of-distribution settings, show that the proposed framework achieves a new start-of-the-art performance with notable generalization ability (e.g., 4.42% and 7.69% average gains of R1@0.7 on Charades-STA and Charades-CG). The code will be available at https://github.com/lntzm/MESM.

It complements GTAV and Synscapes datasets to form what we coin as the 'Three Musketeers'. We demonstrate the value of the Three Musketeers in unsupervised domain adaptation for image semantic segmentation. Results on real-world datasets, Cityscapes, Mapillary Vistas, and BDD100K, establish new benchmarks, largely attributed to UrbanSyn. We make UrbanSyn openly and freely accessible (www.urbansyn.org).

- **Summary**: The localization of teeth and segmentation of periapical lesions in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are crucial tasks for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, which are often time-consuming and require a high level of expertise. However, automating these tasks is challenging due to variations in shape, size, and orientation of lesions, as well as similar topologies among teeth. Moreover, the small volumes occupied by lesions in CBCT images pose a class imbalance problem that needs to be addressed. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based method utilizing two convolutional neural networks: the SpatialConfiguration-Net (SCN) and a modified version of the U-Net. The SCN accurately predicts the coordinates of all teeth present in an image, enabling precise cropping of teeth volumes that are then fed into the U-Net which detects lesions via segmentation. To address class imbalance, we compare the performance of three reweighting loss functions. After evaluation on 144 CBCT images, our method achieves a 97.3% accuracy for teeth localization, along with a promising sensitivity and specificity of 0.97 and 0.88, respectively, for subsequent lesion detection.

- **Summary**: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that requires an algorithm to segment objects referred by free-form language expressions. Despite significant progress in recent years, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods still suffer from considerable language-image modality gap at the pixel and word level. These methods generally 1) rely on sentence-level language features for language-image alignment and 2) lack explicit training supervision for fine-grained visual grounding. Consequently, they exhibit weak object-level correspondence between visual and language features. Without well-grounded features, prior methods struggle to understand complex expressions that require strong reasoning over relationships among multiple objects, especially when dealing with rarely used or ambiguous clauses. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Mask Grounding auxiliary task that significantly improves visual grounding within language features, by explicitly teaching the model to learn fine-grained correspondence between masked textual tokens and their matching visual objects. Mask Grounding can be directly used on prior RIS methods and consistently bring improvements. Furthermore, to holistically address the modality gap, we also design a cross-modal alignment loss and an accompanying alignment module. These additions work synergistically with Mask Grounding. With all these techniques, our comprehensive approach culminates in MagNet Mask-grounded Network), an architecture that significantly outperforms prior arts on three key benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and G-Ref), demonstrating our method's effectiveness in addressing current limitations of RIS algorithms. Our code and pre-trained weights will be released.

- **Summary**: The goal of Universal Cross-Domain Retrieval (UCDR) is to achieve robust performance in generalized test scenarios, wherein data may belong to strictly unknown domains and categories during training. Recently, pre-trained models with prompt tuning have shown strong generalization capabilities and attained noteworthy achievements in various downstream tasks, such as few-shot learning and video-text retrieval. However, applying them directly to UCDR may not sufficiently to handle both domain shift (i.e., adapting to unfamiliar domains) and semantic shift (i.e., transferring to unknown categories). To this end, we propose Prompting-to-Simulate (ProS), the first method to apply prompt tuning for UCDR. ProS employs a two-step process to simulate Content-aware Dynamic Prompts (CaDP) which can impact models to produce generalized features for UCDR. Concretely, in Prompt Units Learning stage, we introduce two Prompt Units to individually capture domain and semantic knowledge in a mask-and-align way. Then, in Context-aware Simulator Learning stage, we train a Content-aware Prompt Simulator under a simulated test scenarios to produce the corresponding CaDP. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance without bringing excessive parameters. Our method is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ProS

- **Summary**: Existing building recognition methods, exemplified by BRAILS, utilize supervised learning to extract information from satellite and street-view images for classification and segmentation. However, each task module requires human-annotated data, hindering the scalability and robustness to regional variations and annotation imbalances. In response, we propose a new zero-shot workflow for building attribute extraction that utilizes large-scale vision and language models to mitigate reliance on external annotations. The proposed workflow contains two key components: image-level captioning and segment-level captioning for the building images based on the vocabularies pertinent to structural and civil engineering. These two components generate descriptive captions by computing feature representations of the image and the vocabularies, and facilitating a semantic match between the visual and textual representations. Consequently, our framework offers a promising avenue to enhance AI-driven captioning for building attribute extraction in the structural and civil engineering domains, ultimately reducing reliance on human annotations while bolstering performance and adaptability.

- **Summary**: Earth vision research typically focuses on extracting geospatial object locations and categories but neglects the exploration of relations between objects and comprehensive reasoning. Based on city planning needs, we develop a multi-modal multi-task VQA dataset (EarthVQA) to advance relational reasoning-based judging, counting, and comprehensive analysis. The EarthVQA dataset contains 6000 images, corresponding semantic masks, and 208,593 QA pairs with urban and rural governance requirements embedded. As objects are the basis for complex relational reasoning, we propose a Semantic OBject Awareness framework (SOBA) to advance VQA in an object-centric way. To preserve refined spatial locations and semantics, SOBA leverages a segmentation network for object semantics generation. The object-guided attention aggregates object interior features via pseudo masks, and bidirectional cross-attention further models object external relations hierarchically. To optimize object counting, we propose a numerical difference loss that dynamically adds difference penalties, unifying the classification and regression tasks. Experimental results show that SOBA outperforms both advanced general and remote sensing methods. We believe this dataset and framework provide a strong benchmark for Earth vision's complex analysis.

- **Summary**: Group equivariance ensures consistent responses to group transformations of the input, leading to more robust models and enhanced generalization capabilities. However, this property can lead to overly constrained models if the symmetries considered in the group differ from those observed in data. While common methods address this by determining the appropriate level of symmetry at the dataset level, they are limited to supervised settings and ignore scenarios in which multiple levels of symmetry co-exist in the same dataset. For instance, pictures of cars and planes exhibit different levels of rotation, yet both are included in the CIFAR-10 dataset. In this paper, we propose a method able to detect the level of symmetry of each input without the need for labels. To this end, we derive a sufficient and necessary condition to learn the distribution of symmetries in the data. Using the learned distribution, we generate pseudo-labels that allow us to learn the levels of symmetry of each input in a self-supervised manner. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic datasets with different per-class levels of symmetries e.g. MNISTMultiple, in which digits are uniformly rotated within a class-dependent interval. We demonstrate that our method can be used for practical applications such as the generation of standardized datasets in which the symmetries are not present, as well as the detection of out-of-distribution symmetries during inference. By doing so, both the generalization and robustness of non-equivariant models can be improved. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/aurban0/ssl-sym.

- **Summary**: We introduce HuTuMotion, an innovative approach for generating natural human motions that navigates latent motion diffusion models by leveraging few-shot human feedback. Unlike existing approaches that sample latent variables from a standard normal prior distribution, our method adapts the prior distribution to better suit the characteristics of the data, as indicated by human feedback, thus enhancing the quality of motion generation. Furthermore, our findings reveal that utilizing few-shot feedback can yield performance levels on par with those attained through extensive human feedback. This discovery emphasizes the potential and efficiency of incorporating few-shot human-guided optimization within latent diffusion models for personalized and style-aware human motion generation applications. The experimental results show the significantly superior performance of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Recently, diffusion-based image generation methods are credited for their remarkable text-to-image generation capabilities, while still facing challenges in accurately generating multilingual scene text images. To tackle this problem, we propose Diff-Text, which is a training-free scene text generation framework for any language. Our model outputs a photo-realistic image given a text of any language along with a textual description of a scene. The model leverages rendered sketch images as priors, thus arousing the potential multilingual-generation ability of the pre-trained Stable Diffusion. Based on the observation from the influence of the cross-attention map on object placement in generated images, we propose a localized attention constraint into the cross-attention layer to address the unreasonable positioning problem of scene text. Additionally, we introduce contrastive image-level prompts to further refine the position of the textual region and achieve more accurate scene text generation. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing method in both the accuracy of text recognition and the naturalness of foreground-background blending.

- **Summary**: Large language models have shown impressive results for multi-hop mathematical reasoning when the input question is only textual. Many mathematical reasoning problems, however, contain both text and image. With the ever-increasing adoption of vision language models (VLMs), understanding their reasoning abilities for such problems is crucial. In this paper, we evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs along various axes through the lens of geometry problems. We procedurally create a synthetic dataset of geometry questions with controllable difficulty levels along multiple axes, thus enabling a systematic evaluation. The empirical results obtained using our benchmark for state-of-the-art VLMs indicate that these models are not as capable in subjects like geometry (and, by generalization, other topics requiring similar reasoning) as suggested by previous benchmarks. This is made especially clear by the construction of our benchmark at various depth levels, since solving higher-depth problems requires long chains of reasoning rather than additional memorized knowledge. We release the dataset for further research in this area.

- **Summary**: The current state-of-the art techniques for image segmentation are often based on U-Net architectures, a U-shaped encoder-decoder networks with skip connections. Despite the powerful performance, the architecture often does not perform well when used on data which has different characteristics than the data it was trained on. Many techniques for improving performance in the presence of domain shift have been developed, however typically only have loose connections to the theory of domain adaption. In this work, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for U-Nets with theoretical guarantees based on the Margin Disparity Discrepancy [1] called the MDD-UNet. We evaluate the proposed technique on the task of hippocampus segmentation, and find that the MDD-UNet is able to learn features which are domain-invariant with no knowledge about the labels in the target domain. The MDD-UNet improves performance over the standard U-Net on 11 out of 12 combinations of datasets. This work serves as a proof of concept by demonstrating an improvement on the U-Net in it's standard form without modern enhancements, which opens up a new avenue of studying domain adaptation for models with very large hypothesis spaces from both methodological and practical perspectives.

- **Summary**: Surgical robotics holds much promise for improving patient safety and clinician experience in the Operating Room (OR). However, it also comes with new challenges, requiring strong team coordination and effective OR management. Automatic detection of surgical activities is a key requirement for developing AI-based intelligent tools to tackle these challenges. The current state-of-the-art surgical activity recognition methods however operate on image-based representations and depend on large-scale labeled datasets whose collection is time-consuming and resource-expensive. This work proposes a new sample-efficient and object-based approach for surgical activity recognition in the OR. Our method focuses on the geometric arrangements between clinicians and surgical devices, thus utilizing the significant object interaction dynamics in the OR. We conduct experiments in a low-data regime study for long video activity recognition. We also benchmark our method againstother object-centric approaches on clip-level action classification and show superior performance.

- **Summary**: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is proposed to migrate a source pre-trained model to continually changing target distributions, addressing real-world dynamism. Existing CTTA methods mainly rely on entropy minimization or teacher-student pseudo-labeling schemes for knowledge extraction in unlabeled target domains. However, dynamic data distributions cause miscalibrated predictions and noisy pseudo-labels in existing self-supervised learning methods, hindering the effective mitigation of error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting problems during the continual adaptation process. To tackle these issues, we propose a continual self-supervised method, Adaptive Distribution Masked Autoencoders (ADMA), which enhances the extraction of target domain knowledge while mitigating the accumulation of distribution shifts. Specifically, we propose a Distribution-aware Masking (DaM) mechanism to adaptively sample masked positions, followed by establishing consistency constraints between the masked target samples and the original target samples. Additionally, for masked tokens, we utilize an efficient decoder to reconstruct a hand-crafted feature descriptor (e.g., Histograms of Oriented Gradients), leveraging its invariant properties to boost task-relevant representations. Through conducting extensive experiments on four widely recognized benchmarks, our proposed method attains state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation CTTA tasks.

- **Summary**: Federated learning with noisy labels (F-LNL) aims at seeking an optimal server model via collaborative distributed learning by aggregating multiple client models trained with local noisy or clean samples. On the basis of a federated learning framework, recent advances primarily adopt label noise filtering to separate clean samples from noisy ones on each client, thereby mitigating the negative impact of label noise. However, these prior methods do not learn noise filters by exploiting knowledge across all clients, leading to sub-optimal and inferior noise filtering performance and thus damaging training stability. In this paper, we present FedDiv to tackle the challenges of F-LNL. Specifically, we propose a global noise filter called Federated Noise Filter for effectively identifying samples with noisy labels on every client, thereby raising stability during local training sessions. Without sacrificing data privacy, this is achieved by modeling the global distribution of label noise across all clients. Then, in an effort to make the global model achieve higher performance, we introduce a Predictive Consistency based Sampler to identify more credible local data for local model training, thus preventing noise memorization and further boosting the training stability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Clothing1M demonstrate that \texttt{FedDiv} achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art F-LNL methods under different label noise settings for both IID and non-IID data partitions.

- **Summary**: Albeit progress has been made in Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), we empirically find that a certain percentage of failure retrieval results are not consistent with their relative captions. To address this issue, this work provides a Visual Question Answering (VQA) perspective to boost the performance of CIR. The resulting VQA4CIR is a post-processing approach and can be directly plugged into existing CIR methods. Given the top-C retrieved images by a CIR method, VQA4CIR aims to decrease the adverse effect of the failure retrieval results being inconsistent with the relative caption. To find the retrieved images inconsistent with the relative caption, we resort to the "QA generation to VQA" self-verification pipeline. For QA generation, we suggest fine-tuning LLM (e.g., LLaMA) to generate several pairs of questions and answers from each relative caption. We then fine-tune LVLM (e.g., LLaVA) to obtain the VQA model. By feeding the retrieved image and question to the VQA model, one can find the images inconsistent with relative caption when the answer by VQA is inconsistent with the answer in the QA pair. Consequently, the CIR performance can be boosted by modifying the ranks of inconsistently retrieved images. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CIR methods on the CIRR and Fashion-IQ datasets.

- **Summary**: We present Intrinsic Image Diffusion, a generative model for appearance decomposition of indoor scenes. Given a single input view, we sample multiple possible material explanations represented as albedo, roughness, and metallic maps. Appearance decomposition poses a considerable challenge in computer vision due to the inherent ambiguity between lighting and material properties and the lack of real datasets. To address this issue, we advocate for a probabilistic formulation, where instead of attempting to directly predict the true material properties, we employ a conditional generative model to sample from the solution space. Furthermore, we show that utilizing the strong learned prior of recent diffusion models trained on large-scale real-world images can be adapted to material estimation and highly improves the generalization to real images. Our method produces significantly sharper, more consistent, and more detailed materials, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by $1.5dB$ on PSNR and by $45\%$ better FID score on albedo prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: There has been a growing adoption of computer vision tools and technologies in architectural design workflows over the past decade. Notable use cases include point cloud generation, visual content analysis, and spatial awareness for robotic fabrication. Multiple image classification, object detection, and semantic pixel segmentation models have become popular for the extraction of high-level symbolic descriptions and semantic content from two-dimensional images and videos. However, a major challenge in this regard has been the extraction of high-level architectural structures (walls, floors, ceilings windows etc.) from diverse imagery where parts of these elements are occluded by furniture, people, or other non-architectural elements. This project aims to tackle this problem by proposing models that are capable of extracting architecturally meaningful semantic descriptions from two-dimensional scenes of populated interior spaces. 1000 virtual classrooms are parametrically generated, randomized along key spatial parameters such as length, width, height, and door/window positions. The positions of cameras, and non-architectural visual obstructions (furniture/objects) are also randomized. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for image-to-image translation (Pix2Pix) is trained on synthetically generated rendered images of these enclosures, along with corresponding image abstractions representing high-level architectural structure. The model is then tested on unseen synthetic imagery of new enclosures, and outputs are compared to ground truth using pixel-wise comparison for evaluation. A similar model evaluation is also carried out on photographs of existing indoor enclosures, to measure its performance in real-world settings.

- **Summary**: On-device training is an emerging approach in machine learning where models are trained on edge devices, aiming to enhance privacy protection and real-time performance. However, edge devices typically possess restricted computational power and resources, making it challenging to perform computationally intensive model training tasks. Consequently, reducing resource consumption during training has become a pressing concern in this field. To this end, we propose SCoTTi (Save Computation at Training Time), an adaptive framework that addresses the aforementioned challenge. It leverages an optimizable threshold parameter to effectively reduce the number of neuron updates during training which corresponds to a decrease in memory and computation footprint. Our proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods regarding computational resource savings on various commonly employed benchmarks and popular architectures, including ResNets, MobileNet, and Swin-T.

- **Summary**: We introduce pixelSplat, a feed-forward model that learns to reconstruct 3D radiance fields parameterized by 3D Gaussian primitives from pairs of images. Our model features real-time and memory-efficient rendering for scalable training as well as fast 3D reconstruction at inference time. To overcome local minima inherent to sparse and locally supported representations, we predict a dense probability distribution over 3D and sample Gaussian means from that probability distribution. We make this sampling operation differentiable via a reparameterization trick, allowing us to back-propagate gradients through the Gaussian splatting representation. We benchmark our method on wide-baseline novel view synthesis on the real-world RealEstate10k and ACID datasets, where we outperform state-of-the-art light field transformers and accelerate rendering by 2.5 orders of magnitude while reconstructing an interpretable and editable 3D radiance field.

- **Summary**: With advanced AI, while every industry is growing at rocket speed, the smart home industry has not reached the next generation. There is still a huge leap of innovation that needs to happen before we call a home a Smart home. A Smart home should predict residents' needs and fulfill them in a timely manner. One of the important tasks of maintaining a home is timely grocery tracking and supply maintenance. Grocery tracking models are very famous in the retail industry but they are nonexistent in the common household. Groceries detection in household refrigerators or storage closets is very complicated compared to retail shelving data. In this paper, home grocery tracking problem is resolved by combining retail shelving data and fruits dataset with real-time 360 view data points collected from home groceries storage. By integrating this vision-based object detection system along with supply chain and user food interest prediction systems, complete automation of groceries ordering can be achieved.

- **Summary**: Geometric fracture assembly presents a challenging practical task in archaeology and 3D computer vision. Previous methods have focused solely on assembling fragments based on semantic information, which has limited the quantity of objects that can be effectively assembled. Therefore, there is a need to develop a scalable framework for geometric fracture assembly without relying on semantic information. To improve the effectiveness of assembling geometric fractures without semantic information, we propose a co-creation space comprising several assemblers capable of gradually and unambiguously assembling fractures. Additionally, we introduce a novel loss function, i.e., the geometric-based collision loss, to address collision issues during the fracture assembly process and enhance the results. Our framework exhibits better performance on both PartNet and Breaking Bad datasets compared to existing state-of-the-art frameworks. Extensive experiments and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which features linear computational complexity, enhanced abstraction, and improved generalization. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Ruiyuan-Zhang/CCS.

- **Summary**: Gradient inversion attacks can leak data privacy when clients share weight updates with the server in federated learning (FL). Existing studies mainly use L2 or cosine distance as the loss function for gradient matching in the attack. Our empirical investigation shows that the vulnerability ranking varies with the loss function used. Gradient norm, which is commonly used as a vulnerability proxy for gradient inversion attack, cannot explain this as it remains constant regardless of the loss function for gradient matching. In this paper, we propose a loss-aware vulnerability proxy (LAVP) for the first time. LAVP refers to either the maximum or minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian with respect to gradient matching loss at ground truth. This suggestion is based on our theoretical findings regarding the local optimization of the gradient inversion in proximity to the ground truth, which corresponds to the worst case attack scenario. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAVP on various architectures and datasets, showing its consistent superiority over the gradient norm in capturing sample vulnerabilities. The performance of each proxy is measured in terms of Spearman's rank correlation with respect to several similarity scores. This work will contribute to enhancing FL security against any potential loss functions beyond L2 or cosine distance in the future.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised action segmentation aims to perform frame-wise classification in long untrimmed videos, where only a fraction of videos in the training set have labels. Recent studies have shown the potential of contrastive learning in unsupervised representation learning using unlabelled data. However, learning the representation of each frame by unsupervised contrastive learning for action segmentation remains an open and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-guided Multi-level Contrast scheme with a Neighbourhood-Consistency-Aware unit (SMC-NCA) to extract strong frame-wise representations for semi-supervised action segmentation. Specifically, for representation learning, SMC is firstly used to explore intra- and inter-information variations in a unified and contrastive way, based on dynamic clustering process of the original input, encoded semantic and temporal features. Then, the NCA module, which is responsible for enforcing spatial consistency between neighbourhoods centered at different frames to alleviate over-segmentation issues, works alongside SMC for semi-supervised learning. Our SMC outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks, offering improvements of up to 17.8% and 12.6% in terms of edit distance and accuracy, respectively. Additionally, the NCA unit results in significant better segmentation performance against the others in the presence of only 5% labelled videos. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on our Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset. The code and datasets will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: The popular CLIP model displays impressive zero-shot capabilities thanks to its seamless interaction with arbitrary text prompts. However, its lack of spatial awareness makes it unsuitable for dense computer vision tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, without an additional fine-tuning step that often uses annotations and can potentially suppress its original open-vocabulary properties. Meanwhile, self-supervised representation methods have demonstrated good localization properties without human-made annotations nor explicit supervision. In this work, we take the best of both worlds and propose a zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, which does not require any annotations. We propose to locally improve dense MaskCLIP features, computed with a simple modification of CLIP's last pooling layer, by integrating localization priors extracted from self-supervised features. By doing so, we greatly improve the performance of MaskCLIP and produce smooth outputs. Moreover, we show that the used self-supervised feature properties can directly be learnt from CLIP features therefore allowing us to obtain the best results with a single pass through CLIP model. Our method CLIP-DINOiser needs only a single forward pass of CLIP and two light convolutional layers at inference, no extra supervision nor extra memory and reaches state-of-the-art results on challenging and fine-grained benchmarks such as COCO, Pascal Context, Cityscapes and ADE20k.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as the de facto paradigm for video generation. However, their reliance on web-scale data of varied quality often yields results that are visually unappealing and misaligned with the textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we propose InstructVideo to instruct text-to-video diffusion models with human feedback by reward fine-tuning. InstructVideo has two key ingredients: 1) To ameliorate the cost of reward fine-tuning induced by generating through the full DDIM sampling chain, we recast reward fine-tuning as editing. By leveraging the diffusion process to corrupt a sampled video, InstructVideo requires only partial inference of the DDIM sampling chain, reducing fine-tuning cost while improving fine-tuning efficiency. 2) To mitigate the absence of a dedicated video reward model for human preferences, we repurpose established image reward models, e.g., HPSv2. To this end, we propose Segmental Video Reward, a mechanism to provide reward signals based on segmental sparse sampling, and Temporally Attenuated Reward, a method that mitigates temporal modeling degradation during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, validate the practicality and efficacy of using image reward models in InstructVideo, significantly enhancing the visual quality of generated videos without compromising generalization capabilities. Code and models will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Instruction tuning of the Large Vision-language Models (LVLMs) has revolutionized the development of versatile models with zero-shot generalization across a wide range of downstream vision-language tasks. However, diversity of training tasks of different sources and formats would lead to inevitable task conflicts, where different tasks conflicts for the same set of model parameters, resulting in sub-optimal instruction-following abilities. To address that, we propose the Mixture of Cluster-conditional LoRA Experts (MoCLE), a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture designed to activate the task-customized model parameters based on the instruction clusters. A separate universal expert is further incorporated to improve the generalization capabilities of MoCLE for novel instructions. Extensive experiments on 10 zero-shot tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoCLE.

- **Summary**: We introduce StreamDiffusion, a real-time diffusion pipeline designed for interactive image generation. Existing diffusion models are adept at creating images from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time interaction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios involving continuous input, such as Metaverse, live video streaming, and broadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. To address this, we present a novel approach that transforms the original sequential denoising into the batching denoising process. Stream Batch eliminates the conventional wait-and-interact approach and enables fluid and high throughput streams. To handle the frequency disparity between data input and model throughput, we design a novel input-output queue for parallelizing the streaming process. Moreover, the existing diffusion pipeline uses classifier-free guidance(CFG), which requires additional U-Net computation. To mitigate the redundant computations, we propose a novel residual classifier-free guidance (RCFG) algorithm that reduces the number of negative conditional denoising steps to only one or even zero. Besides, we introduce a stochastic similarity filter(SSF) to optimize power consumption. Our Stream Batch achieves around 1.5x speedup compared to the sequential denoising method at different denoising levels. The proposed RCFG leads to speeds up to 2.05x higher than the conventional CFG. Combining the proposed strategies and existing mature acceleration tools makes the image-to-image generation achieve up-to 91.07fps on one RTX4090, improving the throughputs of AutoPipline developed by Diffusers over 59.56x. Furthermore, our proposed StreamDiffusion also significantly reduces the energy consumption by 2.39x on one RTX3060 and 1.99x on one RTX4090, respectively.

- **Summary**: The quality of the prompts provided to text-to-image diffusion models determines how faithful the generated content is to the user's intent, often requiring `prompt engineering'. To harness visual concepts from target images without prompt engineering, current approaches largely rely on embedding inversion by optimizing and then mapping them to pseudo-tokens. However, working with such high-dimensional vector representations is challenging because they lack semantics and interpretability, and only allow simple vector operations when using them. Instead, this work focuses on inverting the diffusion model to obtain interpretable language prompts directly. The challenge of doing this lies in the fact that the resulting optimization problem is fundamentally discrete and the space of prompts is exponentially large; this makes using standard optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent, difficult. To this end, we utilize a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space in the model. Further, we leverage the findings that different timesteps of the diffusion process cater to different levels of detail in an image. The later, noisy, timesteps of the forward diffusion process correspond to the semantic information, and therefore, prompt inversion in this range provides tokens representative of the image semantics. We show that our approach can identify semantically interpretable and meaningful prompts for a target image which can be used to synthesize diverse images with similar content. We further illustrate the application of the optimized prompts in evolutionary image generation and concept removal.

- **Summary**: Instance shape reconstruction from a 3D scene involves recovering the full geometries of multiple objects at the semantic instance level. Many methods leverage data-driven learning due to the intricacies of scene complexity and significant indoor occlusions. Training these methods often requires a large-scale, high-quality dataset with aligned and paired shape annotations with real-world scans. Existing datasets are either synthetic or misaligned, restricting the performance of data-driven methods on real data. To this end, we introduce LASA, a Large-scale Aligned Shape Annotation Dataset comprising 10,412 high-quality CAD annotations aligned with 920 real-world scene scans from ArkitScenes, created manually by professional artists. On this top, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Cross-Modal Shape Reconstruction (DisCo) method. It is empowered by a hybrid feature aggregation design to fuse multi-modal inputs and recover high-fidelity object geometries. Besides, we present an Occupancy-Guided 3D Object Detection (OccGOD) method and demonstrate that our shape annotations provide scene occupancy clues that can further improve 3D object detection. Supported by LASA, extensive experiments show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance in both instance-level scene reconstruction and 3D object detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D generative models have made impressive progress, enabling the generation of almost arbitrary 3D assets from text or image inputs. However, these approaches generate objects in isolation without any consideration for the scene where they will eventually be placed. In this paper, we propose a framework that allows for the stylization of an existing 3D asset to fit into a given 2D scene, and additionally produce a photorealistic composition as if the asset was placed within the environment. This not only opens up a new level of control for object stylization, for example, the same assets can be stylized to reflect changes in the environment, such as summer to winter or fantasy versus futuristic settings-but also makes the object-scene composition more controllable. We achieve this by combining modeling and optimizing the object's texture and environmental lighting through differentiable ray tracing with image priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. We demonstrate that our method is applicable to a wide variety of indoor and outdoor scenes and arbitrary objects.

- **Summary**: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process visual inputs has given rise to general-purpose vision systems, unifying various vision-language (VL) tasks by instruction tuning. However, due to the enormous diversity in input-output formats in the vision domain, existing general-purpose models fail to successfully integrate segmentation and multi-image inputs with coarse-level tasks into a single framework. In this work, we introduce VistaLLM, a powerful visual system that addresses coarse- and fine-grained VL tasks over single and multiple input images using a unified framework. VistaLLM utilizes an instruction-guided image tokenizer that filters global embeddings using task descriptions to extract compressed and refined features from numerous images. Moreover, VistaLLM employs a gradient-aware adaptive sampling technique to represent binary segmentation masks as sequences, significantly improving over previously used uniform sampling. To bolster the desired capability of VistaLLM, we curate CoinIt, a comprehensive coarse-to-fine instruction tuning dataset with 6.8M samples. We also address the lack of multi-image grounding datasets by introducing a novel task, AttCoSeg (Attribute-level Co-Segmentation), which boosts the model's reasoning and grounding capability over multiple input images. Extensive experiments on a wide range of V- and VL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of VistaLLM by achieving consistent state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines across all downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we explore a principal way to enhance the quality of object masks produced by different segmentation models. We propose a model-agnostic solution called SegRefiner, which offers a novel perspective on this problem by interpreting segmentation refinement as a data generation process. As a result, the refinement process can be smoothly implemented through a series of denoising diffusion steps. Specifically, SegRefiner takes coarse masks as inputs and refines them using a discrete diffusion process. By predicting the label and corresponding states-transition probabilities for each pixel, SegRefiner progressively refines the noisy masks in a conditional denoising manner. To assess the effectiveness of SegRefiner, we conduct comprehensive experiments on various segmentation tasks, including semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and dichotomous image segmentation. The results demonstrate the superiority of our SegRefiner from multiple aspects. Firstly, it consistently improves both the segmentation metrics and boundary metrics across different types of coarse masks. Secondly, it outperforms previous model-agnostic refinement methods by a significant margin. Lastly, it exhibits a strong capability to capture extremely fine details when refining high-resolution images.

- **Summary**: Accurate depth and semantic segmentation are crucial for various computer vision tasks. However, the scarcity of annotated real-world aerial datasets poses a significant challenge for training and evaluating robust models. Additionally, the detection and segmentation of thin objects, such as wires, cables, and fences, present a critical concern for ensuring the safe operation of drones. To address these limitations, we present a novel synthetic dataset specifically designed for depth and semantic segmentation tasks in aerial views. Leveraging photo-realistic rendering techniques, our dataset provides a valuable resource for training models using a synthetic-supervision training scheme while introducing new drone-specific metrics for depth accuracy.

- **Summary**: Denoising Probabilistic Models (DPMs) represent an emerging domain of generative models that excel in generating diverse and high-quality images. However, most current training methods for DPMs often neglect the correlation between timesteps, limiting the model's performance in generating images effectively. Notably, we theoretically point out that this issue can be caused by the cumulative estimation gap between the predicted and the actual trajectory. To minimize that gap, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-aware} loss that aims to reduce the estimation gap to enhance the sampling quality. Furthermore, we theoretically show that our proposed loss function is a tighter upper bound of the estimation loss in comparison with the conventional loss in DPMs. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets including CIFAR10, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ consistently show a remarkable improvement of our proposed method regarding the image generalization quality measured by FID and Inception Score compared to several DPM baselines. Our code and pre-trained checkpoints are available at \url{https://github.com/viettmab/SA-DPM}.

- **Summary**: Amodal perception, the ability to comprehend complete object structures from partial visibility, is a fundamental skill, even for infants. Its significance extends to applications like autonomous driving, where a clear understanding of heavily occluded objects is essential. However, modern detection and tracking algorithms often overlook this critical capability, perhaps due to the prevalence of modal annotations in most datasets. To address the scarcity of amodal data, we introduce the TAO-Amodal benchmark, featuring 880 diverse categories in thousands of video sequences. Our dataset includes amodal and modal bounding boxes for visible and occluded objects, including objects that are partially out-of-frame. To enhance amodal tracking with object permanence, we leverage a lightweight plug-in module, the amodal expander, to transform standard, modal trackers into amodal ones through fine-tuning on a few hundred video sequences with data augmentation. We achieve a 3.3\% and 1.6\% improvement on the detection and tracking of occluded objects on TAO-Amodal. When evaluated on people, our method produces dramatic improvements of 2x compared to state-of-the-art modal baselines.

- **Summary**: The surge of interest towards Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), e.g., GPT-4V(ision) from OpenAI, has marked a significant trend in both academia and industry. They endow Large Language Models (LLMs) with powerful capabilities in visual understanding, enabling them to tackle diverse multi-modal tasks. Very recently, Google released Gemini, its newest and most capable MLLM built from the ground up for multi-modality. In light of the superior reasoning capabilities, can Gemini challenge GPT-4V's leading position in multi-modal learning? In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration of Gemini Pro's visual understanding proficiency, which comprehensively covers four domains: fundamental perception, advanced cognition, challenging vision tasks, and various expert capacities. We compare Gemini Pro with the state-of-the-art GPT-4V to evaluate its upper limits, along with the latest open-sourced MLLM, Sphinx, which reveals the gap between manual efforts and black-box systems. The qualitative samples indicate that, while GPT-4V and Gemini showcase different answering styles and preferences, they can exhibit comparable visual reasoning capabilities, and Sphinx still trails behind them concerning domain generalizability. Specifically, GPT-4V tends to elaborate detailed explanations and intermediate steps, and Gemini prefers to output a direct and concise answer. The quantitative evaluation on the popular MME benchmark also demonstrates the potential of Gemini to be a strong challenger to GPT-4V. Our early investigation of Gemini also observes some common issues of MLLMs, indicating that there still remains a considerable distance towards artificial general intelligence. Our project for tracking the progress of MLLM is released at https://github.com/BradyFU/Awesome-Multimodal-Large-Language-Models.

- **Summary**: Despite weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) being a promising step toward evading strong instance-level annotations, its capability is confined to closed-set categories within a single training dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised open-vocabulary object detection framework, namely WSOVOD, to extend traditional WSOD to detect novel concepts and utilize diverse datasets with only image-level annotations. To achieve this, we explore three vital strategies, including dataset-level feature adaptation, image-level salient object localization, and region-level vision-language alignment. First, we perform data-aware feature extraction to produce an input-conditional coefficient, which is leveraged into dataset attribute prototypes to identify dataset bias and help achieve cross-dataset generalization. Second, a customized location-oriented weakly supervised region proposal network is proposed to utilize high-level semantic layouts from the category-agnostic segment anything model to distinguish object boundaries. Lastly, we introduce a proposal-concept synchronized multiple-instance network, i.e., object mining and refinement with visual-semantic alignment, to discover objects matched to the text embeddings of concepts. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and MS COCO demonstrate that the proposed WSOVOD achieves new state-of-the-art compared with previous WSOD methods in both close-set object localization and detection tasks. Meanwhile, WSOVOD enables cross-dataset and open-vocabulary learning to achieve on-par or even better performance than well-established fully-supervised open-vocabulary object detection (FSOVOD).

- **Summary**: Text-guided diffusion models offer powerful new ways to generate and manipulate images. Several applications of these models, including image editing interpolation, and semantic augmentation, require diffusion inversion. This is the process of finding a noise seed that can be used to generate a given image. Current techniques for inverting a given image can be slow or inaccurate. The technical challenge for inverting the diffusion process arises from an implicit equation over the latent that cannot be solved in closed form. Previous approaches proposed to solve this issue by approximation or various learning schemes. Here, we formulate the problem as a fixed-point equation problem and solve it using fixed-point iterations, a well-studied approach in numerical analysis. We further identify a source of inconsistency that significantly hurts the inversion of real images encoded to the latent space. We show how to correct it by applying a prompt-aware adjustment of the encoding. Our solution, Fixed-point inversion, is much faster than previous techniques like EDICT and Null-text, with similar inversion quality. It can be combined with any pretrained diffusion model and requires no model training, prompt tuning, or additional parameters. In a series of experiments, we find that Fixed-point inversion shows improved results in several downstream tasks: image editing, image interpolation, and generation of rare objects.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as a highly promising technique for modeling of static 3D scenes. In contrast to Neural Radiance Fields, it utilizes efficient rasterization allowing for very fast rendering at high-quality. However, the storage size is significantly higher, which hinders practical deployment, e.g.~on resource constrained devices. In this paper, we introduce a compact scene representation organizing the parameters of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into a 2D grid with local homogeneity, ensuring a drastic reduction in storage requirements without compromising visual quality during rendering. Central to our idea is the explicit exploitation of perceptual redundancies present in natural scenes. In essence, the inherent nature of a scene allows for numerous permutations of Gaussian parameters to equivalently represent it. To this end, we propose a novel highly parallel algorithm that regularly arranges the high-dimensional Gaussian parameters into a 2D grid while preserving their neighborhood structure. During training, we further enforce local smoothness between the sorted parameters in the grid. The uncompressed Gaussians use the same structure as 3DGS, ensuring a seamless integration with established renderers. Our method achieves a reduction factor of 8x to 26x in size for complex scenes with no increase in training time, marking a substantial leap forward in the domain of 3D scene distribution and consumption.

- **Summary**: Colonoscopy plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and prognosis of various gastrointestinal diseases. Due to the challenges of collecting large-scale high-quality ground truth annotations for colonoscopy images, and more generally medical images, we explore using self-supervised features from vision transformers in three challenging tasks for colonoscopy images. Our results indicate that image-level features learned from DINO models achieve image classification performance comparable to fully supervised models, and patch-level features contain rich semantic information for object detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that self-supervised features combined with unsupervised segmentation can be used to discover multiple clinically relevant structures in a fully unsupervised manner, demonstrating the tremendous potential of applying these methods in medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: One potential drawback of using aggregated performance measurement in machine learning is that models may learn to accept higher errors on some training cases as compromises for lower errors on others, with the lower errors actually being instances of overfitting. This can lead to both stagnation at local optima and poor generalization. Lexicase selection is an uncompromising method developed in evolutionary computation, which selects models on the basis of sequences of individual training case errors instead of using aggregated metrics such as loss and accuracy. In this paper, we investigate how lexicase selection, in its general form, can be integrated into the context of deep learning to enhance generalization. We propose Gradient Lexicase Selection, an optimization framework that combines gradient descent and lexicase selection in an evolutionary fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generalization performance of various widely-used deep neural network architectures across three image classification benchmarks. Additionally, qualitative analysis suggests that our method assists networks in learning more diverse representations.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have ushered in a new era in computer vision, showcasing unparalleled performance in many challenging tasks. However, their practical deployment in computational pathology has largely been constrained by the sheer size of whole slide images (WSIs), which result in lengthy input sequences. Transformers faced a similar limitation when applied to long documents, and Hierarchical Transformers were introduced to circumvent it. Given the analogous challenge with WSIs and their inherent hierarchical structure, Hierarchical Vision Transformers (H-ViTs) emerge as a promising solution in computational pathology. This work delves into the capabilities of H-ViTs, evaluating their efficiency for prostate cancer grading in WSIs. Our results show that they achieve competitive performance against existing state-of-the-art solutions.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes MotionScript, a motion-to-text conversion algorithm and natural language representation for human body motions. MotionScript aims to describe movements in greater detail and with more accuracy than previous natural language approaches. Many motion datasets describe relatively objective and simple actions with little variation on the way they are expressed (e.g. sitting, walking, dribbling a ball). But for expressive actions that contain a diversity of movements in the class (e.g. being sad, dancing), or for actions outside the domain of standard motion capture datasets (e.g. stylistic walking, sign-language), more specific and granular natural language descriptions are needed. Our proposed MotionScript descriptions differ from existing natural language representations in that it provides direct descriptions in natural language instead of simple action labels or high-level human captions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at translating 3D motions to natural language descriptions without requiring training data. Our experiments show that when MotionScript representations are used in a text-to-motion neural task, body movements are more accurately reconstructed, and large language models can be used to generate unseen complex motions.

- **Summary**: Although large-scale text-to-image generative models have shown promising performance in synthesizing high-quality images, directly applying these models to image editing remains a significant challenge. This challenge is further amplified in video editing due to the additional dimension of time. Especially for editing real videos as it necessitates maintaining a stable semantic layout across the frames while executing localized edits precisely without disrupting the existing backgrounds. In this paper, we propose RealCraft, an attention-control-based method for zero-shot editing in real videos. By employing the object-centric manipulation of cross-attention between prompts and frames and spatial-temporal attention within the frames, we achieve precise shape-wise editing along with enhanced consistency. Our model can be used directly with Stable Diffusion and operates without the need for additional localized information. We showcase our zero-shot attention-control-based method across a range of videos, demonstrating localized, high-fidelity, shape-precise and time-consistent editing in videos of various lengths, up to 64 frames.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a novel self-supervised method for Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) reconstruction. Reducing the radiation dose to patients during a CT scan is a crucial challenge since the quality of the reconstruction highly degrades because of low photons or limited measurements. Supervised deep learning methods have shown the ability to remove noise in images but require accurate ground truth which can be obtained only by performing additional high-radiation CT scans. Therefore, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for LDCT, in which ground truth is not required for training the convolutional neural network (CNN). Based on the Noise2Inverse (N2I) method, we enforce in the training loss the equivariant property of rotation transformation, which is induced by the CT imaging system, to improve the quality of the CT image in a lower dose. Numerical and experimental results show that the reconstruction accuracy of N2I with sparse views is degrading while the proposed rotational augmented Noise2Inverse (RAN2I) method keeps better image quality over a different range of sampling angles. Finally, the quantitative results demonstrate that RAN2I achieves higher image quality compared to N2I, and experimental results of RAN2I on real projection data show comparable performance to supervised learning.

- **Summary**: Among existing Neural Architecture Search methods, DARTS is known for its efficiency and simplicity. This approach applies continuous relaxation of network representation to construct a weight-sharing supernet and enables the identification of excellent subnets in just a few GPU days. However, performance collapse in DARTS results in deteriorating architectures filled with parameter-free operations and remains a great challenge to the robustness. To resolve this problem, we reveal that the fundamental reason is the biased estimation of the candidate importance in the search space through theoretical and experimental analysis, and more precisely select operations via information-based measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the excessive concern over the supernet and inefficient utilization of data in bi-level optimization also account for suboptimal results. We adopt a more realistic objective focusing on the performance of subnets and simplify it with the help of the information-based measurements. Finally, we explain theoretically why progressively shrinking the width of the supernet is necessary and reduce the approximation error of optimal weights in DARTS. Our proposed method, named IS-DARTS, comprehensively improves DARTS and resolves the aforementioned problems. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS-based search space demonstrate the effectiveness of IS-DARTS.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have shown impressive performance for image generation, often times outperforming other generative models. Since their introduction, researchers have extended the powerful noise-to-image denoising pipeline to discriminative tasks, including image segmentation. In this work we propose a conditional score-based generative modeling framework for medical image segmentation which relies on a parametric surface representation for the segmentation masks. The surface re-parameterization allows the direct application of standard diffusion theory, as opposed to when the mask is represented as a binary mask. Moreover, we adapted an extended variant of the diffusion technique known as the "cold-diffusion" where the diffusion model can be constructed with deterministic perturbations instead of Gaussian noise, which facilitates significantly faster convergence in the reverse diffusion. We evaluated our method on the segmentation of the left ventricle from 65 transthoracic echocardiogram videos (2230 echo image frames) and compared its performance to the most popular and widely used image segmentation models. Our proposed model not only outperformed the compared methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, but also showed potential in estimating segmentation uncertainties for further downstream analyses due to its inherent generative nature.

- **Summary**: Researchers have shown significant correlations among segmented objects in various medical imaging modalities and disease related pathologies. Several studies showed that using hand crafted features for disease prediction neglects the immense possibility to use latent features from deep learning (DL) models which may reduce the overall accuracy of differential diagnosis. However, directly using classification or segmentation models on medical to learn latent features opt out robust feature selection and may lead to overfitting. To fill this gap, we propose a novel feature selection technique using the latent space of a segmentation model that can aid diagnosis. We evaluated our method in differentiating a rare cardiac disease: Takotsubo Syndrome (TTS) from the ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) using echocardiogram videos (echo). TTS can mimic clinical features of STEMI in echo and extremely hard to distinguish. Our approach shows promising results in differential diagnosis of TTS with 82% diagnosis accuracy beating the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. Moreover, the robust feature selection technique using LASSO algorithm shows great potential in reducing the redundant features and creates a robust pipeline for short- and long-term disease prognoses in the downstream analysis.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in vision language pretraining (VLP) have been largely attributed to the large-scale data collected from the web. However, uncurated dataset contains weakly correlated image-text pairs, causing data inefficiency. To address the issue, knowledge distillation have been explored at the expense of extra image and text momentum encoders to generate teaching signals for misaligned image-text pairs. In this paper, our goal is to resolve the misalignment problem with an efficient distillation framework. To this end, we propose ECLIPSE: Expediting Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining with Self-distilled Encoders. ECLIPSE features a distinctive distillation architecture wherein a shared text encoder is utilized between an online image encoder and a momentum image encoder. This strategic design choice enables the distillation to operate within a unified projected space of text embedding, resulting in better performance. Based on the unified text embedding space, ECLIPSE compensates for the additional computational cost of the momentum image encoder by expediting the online image encoder. Through our extensive experiments, we validate that there is a sweet spot between expedition and distillation where the partial view from the expedited online image encoder interacts complementarily with the momentum teacher. As a result, ECLIPSE outperforms its counterparts while achieving substantial acceleration in inference speed.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has emerged as a prominent approach for training vision and text encoders with uncurated image-text pairs from the web. To enhance data-efficiency, recent efforts have introduced additional supervision terms that involve random-augmented views of the image. However, since the image augmentation process is unaware of its text counterpart, this procedure could cause various degrees of image-text misalignments during training. Prior methods either disregarded this discrepancy or introduced external models to mitigate the impact of misalignments during training. In contrast, we propose a novel metric learning approach that capitalizes on these misalignments as an additional training source, which we term "Misalign, Contrast then Distill (MCD)". Unlike previous methods that treat augmented images and their text counterparts as simple positive pairs, MCD predicts the continuous scales of misalignment caused by the augmentation. Our extensive experimental results show that our proposed MCD achieves state-of-the-art transferability in multiple classification and retrieval downstream datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep neural networks have achieved significant progress in detecting individual objects from an image. However, object detection is not sufficient to fully understand a visual scene. Towards a deeper visual understanding, the interactions between objects, especially humans and objects are essential. Most prior works have obtained this information with a bottom-up approach, where the objects are first detected and the interactions are predicted sequentially by pairing the objects. This is a major bottleneck in HOI detection inference time. To tackle this problem, we propose UnionDet, a one-stage meta-architecture for HOI detection powered by a novel union-level detector that eliminates this additional inference stage by directly capturing the region of interaction. Our one-stage detector for human-object interaction shows a significant reduction in interaction prediction time 4x~14x while outperforming state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets: V-COCO and HICO-DET.

- **Summary**: The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm has been recently proposed to alleviate the issues of backpropagation (BP) commonly used to train deep neural networks. However, its current formulation exhibits limitations such as the generation of negative data, slower convergence, and inadequate performance on complex tasks. In this paper, we take the main ideas of FF and improve them by leveraging channel-wise competitive learning in the context of convolutional neural networks for image classification tasks. A layer-wise loss function is introduced that promotes competitive learning and eliminates the need for negative data construction. To enhance both the learning of compositional features and feature space partitioning, a channel-wise feature separator and extractor block is proposed that complements the competitive learning process. Our method outperforms recent FF-based models on image classification tasks, achieving testing errors of 0.58%, 7.69%, 21.89%, and 48.77% on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively. Our approach bridges the performance gap between FF learning and BP methods, indicating the potential of our proposed approach to learn useful representations in a layer-wise modular fashion, enabling more efficient and flexible learning.
