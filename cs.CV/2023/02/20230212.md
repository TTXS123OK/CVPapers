- **Summary**: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a type of cancer that originates in the kidneys and is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. It can be classified into several subtypes, including clear cell RCC, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC. In this study, an artificial intelligence model was developed and trained for classifying different subtypes of RCC using ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network that has been widely used for image classification tasks. The model was trained on a dataset of RCC histopathology images, which consisted of digital images of RCC surgical resection slides that were annotated with the corresponding subtype labels. The performance of the trained model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, in this research, a novel synthetic image generation tool, NephroNet, is developed on diffusion models that are used to generate original images of RCC surgical resection slides. Diffusion models are a class of generative models capable of synthesizing high-quality images from noise. Several diffusers such as Stable Diffusion, Dreambooth Text-to-Image, and Textual Inversion were trained on a dataset of RCC images and were used to generate a series of original images that resembled RCC surgical resection slides, all within the span of fewer than four seconds. The generated images were visually realistic and could be used for creating new training datasets, testing the performance of image analysis algorithms, and training medical professionals. NephroNet is provided as an open-source software package and contains files for data preprocessing, training, and visualization. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence and diffusion models for classifying and generating RCC images, respectively. These methods could be useful for improving the diagnosis and treatment of RCC and more.

- **Summary**: Point Cloud Registration is a fundamental and challenging problem in 3D computer vision. Recent works often utilize the geometric structure information in point feature embedding or outlier rejection for registration while neglecting to consider explicitly isometry-preserving constraint ($e.g.,$ point pair linked edge's length preserving after transformation) in training. We claim that the explicit isometry-preserving constraint is also important for improving feature representation abilities in the feature training stage. To this end, we propose a \underline{G}raph \underline{M}atching \underline{O}ptimization based \underline{Net}work (GMONet for short), which utilizes the graph-matching optimizer to explicitly exert the isometry preserving constraints in the point feature training to improve the point feature representation. Specifically, we exploit a partial graph-matching optimizer to optimize the super point ($i.e.,$ down-sampled key points) features and a full graph-matching optimizer to optimize fine-level point features in the overlap region. Meanwhile, we leverage the inexact proximal point method and the mini-batch sampling technique to accelerate these two graph-matching optimizers. Given high discriminative point features in the evaluation stage, we utilize the RANSAC approach to estimate the transformation between the scanned pairs. The proposed method has been evaluated on the 3DMatch/3DLoMatch benchmarks and the KITTI benchmark. The experimental results show that our method performs competitively compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: Local feature matching is an essential component in many visual applications. In this work, we propose OAMatcher, a Tranformer-based detector-free method that imitates humans behavior to generate dense and accurate matches. Firstly, OAMatcher predicts overlapping areas to promote effective and clean global context aggregation, with the key insight that humans focus on the overlapping areas instead of the entire images after multiple observations when matching keypoints in image pairs. Technically, we first perform global information integration across all keypoints to imitate the humans behavior of observing the entire images at the beginning of feature matching. Then, we propose Overlapping Areas Prediction Module (OAPM) to capture the keypoints in co-visible regions and conduct feature enhancement among them to simulate that humans transit the focus regions from the entire images to overlapping regions, hence realizeing effective information exchange without the interference coming from the keypoints in non overlapping areas. Besides, since humans tend to leverage probability to determine whether the match labels are correct or not, we propose a Match Labels Weight Strategy (MLWS) to generate the coefficients used to appraise the reliability of the ground-truth match labels, while alleviating the influence of measurement noise coming from the data. Moreover, we integrate depth-wise convolution into Tranformer encoder layers to ensure OAMatcher extracts local and global feature representation concurrently. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OAMatcher outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, while exhibiting excellent robustness to extreme appearance variants.

- **Summary**: We propose Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB), a new class of conditional diffusion models that directly learn the nonlinear diffusion processes between two given distributions. These diffusion bridges are particularly useful for image restoration, as the degraded images are structurally informative priors for reconstructing the clean images. I$^2$SB belongs to a tractable class of Schr\"odinger bridge, the nonlinear extension to score-based models, whose marginal distributions can be computed analytically given boundary pairs. This results in a simulation-free framework for nonlinear diffusions, where the I$^2$SB training becomes scalable by adopting practical techniques used in standard diffusion models. We validate I$^2$SB in solving various image restoration tasks, including inpainting, super-resolution, deblurring, and JPEG restoration on ImageNet 256x256 and show that I$^2$SB surpasses standard conditional diffusion models with more interpretable generative processes. Moreover, I$^2$SB matches the performance of inverse methods that additionally require the knowledge of the corruption operators. Our work opens up new algorithmic opportunities for developing efficient nonlinear diffusion models on a large scale. scale. Project page and codes: https://i2sb.github.io/

- **Summary**: Tensor completion is important to many areas such as computer vision, data analysis, and signal processing. Enforcing low-rank structures on completed tensors, a category of methods known as low-rank tensor completion, has recently been studied extensively. Whilst such methods attained great success, none considered exploiting numerical priors of tensor elements. Ignoring numerical priors causes loss of important information regarding the data, and therefore prevents the algorithms from reaching optimal accuracy. This work attempts to construct a new methodological framework called GCDTC (Generalized CP Decomposition Tensor Completion) for leveraging numerical priors and achieving higher accuracy in tensor completion. In this newly introduced framework, a generalized form of CP Decomposition is applied to low-rank tensor completion. This paper also proposes an algorithm known as SPTC (Smooth Poisson Tensor Completion) for nonnegative integer tensor completion as an instantiation of the GCDTC framework. A series of experiments on real-world data indicate that SPTC could produce results superior in completion accuracy to current state-of-the-art methods. Related code is available in the supplemental materials.

- **Summary**: In response to an object presentation, supervised learning schemes generally respond with a parsimonious label. Upon a similar presentation we humans respond again with a label, but are flooded, in addition, by a myriad of associations. A significant portion of these consist of the presented object attributes. Contrastive learning is a semi-supervised learning scheme based on the application of identity preserving transformations on the object input representations. It is conjectured in this work that these same applied transformations preserve, in addition to the identity of the presented object, also the identity of its semantically meaningful attributes. The corollary of this is that the output representations of such a contrastive learning scheme contain valuable information not only for the classification of the presented object, but also for the presence or absence decision of any attribute of interest. Simulation results which demonstrate this idea and the feasibility of this conjecture are presented.

- **Summary**: Synthesizing realistic animations of humans, animals, and even imaginary creatures, has long been a goal for artists and computer graphics professionals. Compared to the imaging domain, which is rich with large available datasets, the number of data instances for the motion domain is limited, particularly for the animation of animals and exotic creatures (e.g., dragons), which have unique skeletons and motion patterns. In this work, we present a Single Motion Diffusion Model, dubbed SinMDM, a model designed to learn the internal motifs of a single motion sequence with arbitrary topology and synthesize motions of arbitrary length that are faithful to them. We harness the power of diffusion models and present a denoising network explicitly designed for the task of learning from a single input motion. SinMDM is designed to be a lightweight architecture, which avoids overfitting by using a shallow network with local attention layers that narrow the receptive field and encourage motion diversity. SinMDM can be applied in various contexts, including spatial and temporal in-betweening, motion expansion, style transfer, and crowd animation. Our results show that SinMDM outperforms existing methods both in quality and time-space efficiency. Moreover, while current approaches require additional training for different applications, our work facilitates these applications at inference time.

- **Summary**: Uncertainty estimation is an important task for critical problems, such as robotics and autonomous driving, because it allows creating statistically better perception models and signaling the model's certainty in its predictions to the decision method or a human supervisor. In this paper, we propose a Variational Neural Network-based version of a Voxel Pseudo Image Tracking (VPIT) method for 3D Single Object Tracking. The Variational Feature Generation Network of the proposed Variational VPIT computes features for target and search regions and the corresponding uncertainties, which are later combined using an uncertainty-aware cross-correlation module in one of two ways: by computing similarity between the corresponding uncertainties and adding it to the regular cross-correlation values, or by penalizing the uncertain feature channels to increase influence of the certain features. In experiments, we show that both methods improve tracking performance, while penalization of uncertain features provides the best uncertainty quality.

- **Summary**: The waterdrops on windshields during driving can cause severe visual obstructions, which may lead to car accidents. Meanwhile, the waterdrops can also degrade the performance of a computer vision system in autonomous driving. To address these issues, we propose an attention-based framework that fuses the spatio-temporal representations from multiple frames to restore visual information occluded by waterdrops. Due to the lack of training data for video waterdrop removal, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset with simulated waterdrops in complex driving scenes on rainy days. To improve the generality of our proposed method, we adopt a cross-modality training strategy that combines synthetic videos and real-world images. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method can generalize well and achieve the best waterdrop removal performance in complex real-world driving scenes.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving needs to rely on high-quality 3D object detection to ensure safe navigation in the world. Uncertainty estimation is an effective tool to provide statistically accurate predictions, while the associated detection uncertainty can be used to implement a more safe navigation protocol or include the user in the loop. In this paper, we propose a Variational Neural Network-based TANet 3D object detector to generate 3D object detections with uncertainty and introduce these detections to an uncertainty-aware AB3DMOT tracker. This is done by applying a linear transformation to the estimated uncertainty matrix, which is subsequently used as a measurement noise for the adopted Kalman filter. We implement two ways to estimate output uncertainty, i.e., internally, by computing the variance of the CNNs outputs and then propagating the uncertainty through the post-processing, and externally, by associating the final predictions of different samples and computing the covariance of each predicted box. In experiments, we show that the external uncertainty estimation leads to better results, outperforming both internal uncertainty estimation and classical tracking approaches. Furthermore, we propose a method to initialize the Variational 3D object detector with a pretrained TANet model, which leads to the best performing models.

- **Summary**: The goal of Few-Shot Continual Learning (FSCL) is to incrementally learn novel tasks with limited labeled samples and preserve previous capabilities simultaneously, while current FSCL methods are all for the class-incremental purpose. Moreover, the evaluation of FSCL solutions is only the cumulative performance of all encountered tasks, but there is no work on exploring the domain generalization ability. Domain generalization is a challenging yet practical task that aims to generalize beyond training domains. In this paper, we set up a Generalized FSCL (GFSCL) protocol involving both class- and domain-incremental situations together with the domain generalization assessment. Firstly, two benchmark datasets and protocols are newly arranged, and detailed baselines are provided for this unexplored configuration. We find that common continual learning methods have poor generalization ability on unseen domains and cannot better cope with the catastrophic forgetting issue in cross-incremental tasks. In this way, we further propose a rehearsal-free framework based on Vision Transformer (ViT) named Contrastive Mixture of Adapters (CMoA). Due to different optimization targets of class increment and domain increment, the CMoA contains two parts: (1) For the class-incremental issue, the Mixture of Adapters (MoA) module is incorporated into ViT, then cosine similarity regularization and the dynamic weighting are designed to make each adapter learn specific knowledge and concentrate on particular classes. (2) For the domain-related issues and domain-invariant representation learning, we alleviate the inner-class variation by prototype-calibrated contrastive learning. The codes and protocols are available at https://github.com/yawencui/CMoA.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal fact verification has become an important but challenging issue on social media due to the mismatch between the text and images in the misinformation of news content, which has been addressed by considering cross-modalities to identify the veracity of the news in recent years. In this paper, we propose the Pre-CoFactv2 framework with new parameter-efficient foundation models for modeling fine-grained text and input embeddings with lightening parameters, multi-modal multi-type fusion for not only capturing relations for the same and different modalities but also for different types (i.e., claim and document), and feature representations for explicitly providing metadata for each sample. In addition, we introduce a unified ensemble method to boost model performance by adjusting the importance of each trained model with not only the weights but also the powers. Extensive experiments show that Pre-CoFactv2 outperforms Pre-CoFact by a large margin and achieved new state-of-the-art results at the Factify challenge at AAAI 2023. We further illustrate model variations to verify the relative contributions of different components. Our team won the first prize (F1-score: 81.82%) and we made our code publicly available at https://github.com/wwweiwei/Pre-CoFactv2-AAAI-2023.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning, which is strikingly referred to as the dark matter of intelligence, is gaining more attention in biomedical applications of deep learning. In this work, we introduce a novel self-supervision objective for the analysis of cells in biomedical microscopy images. We propose training deep learning models to pseudo-colorize masked cells. We use a physics-informed pseudo-spectral colormap that is well suited for colorizing cell topology. Our experiments reveal that approximating semantic segmentation by pseudo-colorization is beneficial for subsequent fine-tuning on cell detection. Inspired by the recent success of masked image modeling, we additionally mask out cell parts and train to reconstruct these parts to further enrich the learned representations. We compare our pre-training method with self-supervised frameworks including contrastive learning (SimCLR), masked autoencoders (MAEs), and edge-based self-supervision. We build upon our previous work and train hybrid models for cell detection, which contain both convolutional and vision transformer modules. Our pre-training method can outperform SimCLR, MAE-like masked image modeling, and edge-based self-supervision when pre-training on a diverse set of six fluorescence microscopy datasets.

- **Summary**: Digital twin is a problem of augmenting real objects with their digital counterparts. It can underpin a wide range of applications in augmented reality (AR), autonomy, and UI/UX. A critical component in a good digital-twin system is real-time, accurate 3D object tracking. Most existing works solve 3D object tracking through the lens of robotic grasping, employ older generations of depth sensors, and measure performance metrics that may not apply to other digital-twin applications such as in AR. In this work, we create a novel RGB-D dataset, called Digital Twin Tracking Dataset (DTTD), to enable further research of the problem and extend potential solutions towards longer ranges and mm localization accuracy. To reduce point cloud noise from the input source, we select the latest Microsoft Azure Kinect as the state-of-the-art time-of-flight (ToF) camera. In total, 103 scenes of 10 common off-the-shelf objects with rich textures are recorded, with each frame annotated with a per-pixel semantic segmentation and ground-truth object poses provided by a commercial motion capturing system. Through extensive experiments with model-level and dataset-level analysis, we demonstrate that DTTD can help researchers develop future object tracking methods and analyze new challenges. The dataset, data generation, annotation, and model evaluation pipeline are made publicly available as open source code at: https://github.com/augcog/DTTDv1.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in training vision-language models have demonstrated unprecedented robustness and transfer learning effectiveness; however, standard computer vision datasets are image-only, and therefore not well adapted to such training methods. Our paper introduces a simple methodology for adapting any fine-grained image classification dataset for distributed vision-language pretraining. We implement this methodology on the challenging iNaturalist-2021 dataset, comprised of approximately 2.7 million images of macro-organisms across 10,000 classes, and achieve a new state-of-the art model in terms of zero-shot classification accuracy. Somewhat surprisingly, our model (trained using a new method called locked-image text tuning) uses a pre-trained, frozen vision representation, proving that language alignment alone can attain strong transfer learning performance, even on fractious, long-tailed datasets. Our approach opens the door for utilizing high quality vision-language pretrained models in agriculturally relevant applications involving species detection.

- **Summary**: Deep learning (DL) along with never-ending advancements in computational processing and cloud technologies have bestowed us powerful analyzing tools and techniques in the past decade and enabled us to use and apply them in various fields of study. Health informatics is not an exception, and conversely, is the discipline that generates the most amount of data in today's era and can benefit from DL the most. Extracting features and finding complex patterns from a huge amount of raw data and transforming them into knowledge is a challenging task. Besides, various DL architectures have been proposed by researchers throughout the years to tackle different problems. In this paper, we provide a review of DL models and their broad application in bioinformatics and healthcare categorized by their architecture. In addition, we also go over some of the key challenges that still exist and can show up while conducting DL research.



### Policy-Induced Self-Supervision Improves Representation Finetuning in Visual RL

- **Summary**: We study how to transfer representations pretrained on source tasks to target tasks in visual percept based RL. We analyze two popular approaches: freezing or finetuning the pretrained representations. Empirical studies on a set of popular tasks reveal several properties of pretrained representations. First, finetuning is required even when pretrained representations perfectly capture the information required to solve the target task. Second, finetuned representations improve learnability and are more robust to noise. Third, pretrained bottom layers are task-agnostic and readily transferable to new tasks, while top layers encode task-specific information and require adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose a self-supervised objective that clusters representations according to the policy they induce, as opposed to traditional representation similarity measures which are policy-agnostic (e.g. Euclidean norm, cosine similarity). Together with freezing the bottom layers, this objective results in significantly better representation than frozen, finetuned, and self-supervised alternatives on a wide range of benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) with self-attention modules have recently achieved great empirical success in many vision tasks. Due to non-convex interactions across layers, however, theoretical learning and generalization analysis is mostly elusive. Based on a data model characterizing both label-relevant and label-irrelevant tokens, this paper provides the first theoretical analysis of training a shallow ViT, i.e., one self-attention layer followed by a two-layer perceptron, for a classification task. We characterize the sample complexity to achieve a zero generalization error. Our sample complexity bound is positively correlated with the inverse of the fraction of label-relevant tokens, the token noise level, and the initial model error. We also prove that a training process using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) leads to a sparse attention map, which is a formal verification of the general intuition about the success of attention. Moreover, this paper indicates that a proper token sparsification can improve the test performance by removing label-irrelevant and/or noisy tokens, including spurious correlations. Empirical experiments on synthetic data and CIFAR-10 dataset justify our theoretical results and generalize to deeper ViTs.

- **Summary**: Real-world robotics applications demand object pose estimation methods that work reliably across a variety of scenarios. Modern learning-based approaches require large labeled datasets and tend to perform poorly outside the training domain. Our first contribution is to develop a robust corrector module that corrects pose estimates using depth information, thus enabling existing methods to better generalize to new test domains; the corrector operates on semantic keypoints (but is also applicable to other pose estimators) and is fully differentiable. Our second contribution is an ensemble self-training approach that simultaneously trains multiple pose estimators in a self-supervised manner. Our ensemble self-training architecture uses the robust corrector to refine the output of each pose estimator; then, it evaluates the quality of the outputs using observable correctness certificates; finally, it uses the observably correct outputs for further training, without requiring external supervision. As an additional contribution, we propose small improvements to a regression-based keypoint detection architecture, to enhance its robustness to outliers; these improvements include a robust pooling scheme and a robust centroid computation. Experiments on the YCBV and TLESS datasets show the proposed ensemble self-training outperforms fully supervised baselines while not requiring 3D annotations on real data.
