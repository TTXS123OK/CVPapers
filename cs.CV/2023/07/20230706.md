- **Summary**: We demonstrate two novel editing procedures in the context of fantasy card art. Palette transfer applies a specified reference palette to a given card. For fantasy art, the desired change in palette can be very large, leading to huge changes in the "look" of the art. We demonstrate that a pipeline of vector quantization; matching; and "vector dequantization" (using a diffusion model) produces successful extreme palette transfers. Segment control allows an artist to move one or more image segments, and to optionally specify the desired color of the result. The combination of these two types of edit yields valuable workflows, including: move a segment, then recolor; recolor, then force some segments to take a prescribed color. We demonstrate our methods on the challenging Yu-Gi-Oh card art dataset.

- **Summary**: Multimodal summarization usually suffers from the problem that the contribution of the visual modality is unclear. Existing multimodal summarization approaches focus on designing the fusion methods of different modalities, while ignoring the adaptive conditions under which visual modalities are useful. Therefore, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine contribution network for multimodal Summarization (CFSum) to consider different contributions of images for summarization. First, to eliminate the interference of useless images, we propose a pre-filter module to abandon useless images. Second, to make accurate use of useful images, we propose two levels of visual complement modules, word level and phrase level. Specifically, image contributions are calculated and are adopted to guide the attention of both textual and visual modalities. Experimental results have shown that CFSum significantly outperforms multiple strong baselines on the standard benchmark. Furthermore, the analysis verifies that useful images can even help generate non-visual words which are implicitly represented in the image.

- **Summary**: The fine-grained action analysis of the existing action datasets is challenged by insufficient action categories, low fine granularities, limited modalities, and tasks. In this paper, we propose a Multi-modality and Multi-task dataset of Figure Skating (MMFS) which was collected from the World Figure Skating Championships. MMFS, which possesses action recognition and action quality assessment, captures RGB, skeleton, and is collected the score of actions from 11671 clips with 256 categories including spatial and temporal labels. The key contributions of our dataset fall into three aspects as follows. (1) Independently spatial and temporal categories are first proposed to further explore fine-grained action recognition and quality assessment. (2) MMFS first introduces the skeleton modality for complex fine-grained action quality assessment. (3) Our multi-modality and multi-task dataset encourage more action analysis models. To benchmark our dataset, we adopt RGB-based and skeleton-based baseline methods for action recognition and action quality assessment.

- **Summary**: Advanced manipulation techniques have provided criminals with opportunities to make social panic or gain illicit profits through the generation of deceptive media, such as forged face images. In response, various deepfake detection methods have been proposed to assess image authenticity. Sequential deepfake detection, which is an extension of deepfake detection, aims to identify forged facial regions with the correct sequence for recovery. Nonetheless, due to the different combinations of spatial and sequential manipulations, forged face images exhibit substantial discrepancies that severely impact detection performance. Additionally, the recovery of forged images requires knowledge of the manipulation model to implement inverse transformations, which is difficult to ascertain as relevant techniques are often concealed by attackers. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Collaboration and Multi-Supervision Network (MMNet) that handles various spatial scales and sequential permutations in forged face images and achieve recovery without requiring knowledge of the corresponding manipulation method. Furthermore, existing evaluation metrics only consider detection accuracy at a single inferring step, without accounting for the matching degree with ground-truth under continuous multiple steps. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel evaluation metric called Complete Sequence Matching (CSM), which considers the detection accuracy at multiple inferring steps, reflecting the ability to detect integrally forged sequences. Extensive experiments on several typical datasets demonstrate that MMNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and independent recovery performance.

- **Summary**: Objective: Quantitative $T_1\rho$ imaging has potential for assessment of biochemical alterations of liver pathologies. Deep learning methods have been employed to accelerate quantitative $T_1\rho$ imaging. To employ artificial intelligence-based quantitative imaging methods in complicated clinical environment, it is valuable to estimate the uncertainty of the predicated $T_1\rho$ values to provide the confidence level of the quantification results. The uncertainty should also be utilized to aid the post-hoc quantitative analysis and model learning tasks. Approach: To address this need, we propose a parametric map refinement approach for learning-based $T_1\rho$ mapping and train the model in a probabilistic way to model the uncertainty. We also propose to utilize the uncertainty map to spatially weight the training of an improved $T_1\rho$ mapping network to further improve the mapping performance and to remove pixels with unreliable $T_1\rho$ values in the region of interest. The framework was tested on a dataset of 51 patients with different liver fibrosis stages. Main results: Our results indicate that the learning-based map refinement method leads to a relative mapping error of less than 3% and provides uncertainty estimation simultaneously. The estimated uncertainty reflects the actual error level, and it can be used to further reduce relative $T_1\rho$ mapping error to 2.60% as well as removing unreliable pixels in the region of interest effectively. Significance: Our studies demonstrate the proposed approach has potential to provide a learning-based quantitative MRI system for trustworthy $T_1\rho$ mapping of the liver.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has played a significant role in the success of facial expression recognition (FER), thanks to large models and vast amounts of labelled data. However, obtaining labelled data requires a tremendous amount of human effort, time, and financial resources. Even though some prior works have focused on reducing the need for large amounts of labelled data using different unsupervised methods, another promising approach called active learning is barely explored in the context of FER. This approach involves selecting and labelling the most representative samples from an unlabelled set to make the best use of a limited 'labelling budget'. In this paper, we implement and study 8 recent active learning methods on three public FER datasets, FER13, RAF-DB, and KDEF. Our findings show that existing active learning methods do not perform well in the context of FER, likely suffering from a phenomenon called 'Cold Start', which occurs when the initial set of labelled samples is not well representative of the entire dataset. To address this issue, we propose contrastive self-supervised pre-training, which first learns the underlying representations based on the entire unlabelled dataset. We then follow this with the active learning methods and observe that our 2-step approach shows up to 9.2% improvement over random sampling and up to 6.7% improvement over the best existing active learning baseline without the pre-training. We will make the code for this study public upon publication at: github.com/ShuvenduRoy/ActiveFER.

- **Summary**: Multi-Camera Multi-Target Tracking (MCMT) is a computer vision technique that involves tracking multiple targets simultaneously across multiple cameras. MCMT in urban traffic visual analysis faces great challenges due to the complex and dynamic nature of urban traffic scenes, where multiple cameras with different views and perspectives are often used to cover a large city-scale area. Targets in urban traffic scenes often undergo occlusion, illumination changes, and perspective changes, making it difficult to associate targets across different cameras accurately. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel systematic MCMT framework, called CityTrack. Specifically, we present a Location-Aware SCMT tracker which integrates various advanced techniques to improve its effectiveness in the MCMT task and propose a novel Box-Grained Matching (BGM) method for the ICA module to solve the aforementioned problems. We evaluated our approach on the public test set of the CityFlowV2 dataset and achieved an IDF1 of 84.91%, ranking 1st in the 2022 AI CITY CHALLENGE. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming the challenges posed by urban traffic scenes.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have recently shown remarkable success in high-quality image generation. Sometimes, however, a pre-trained diffusion model exhibits partial misalignment in the sense that the model can generate good images, but it sometimes outputs undesirable images. If so, we simply need to prevent the generation of the bad images, and we call this task censoring. In this work, we present censored generation with a pre-trained diffusion model using a reward model trained on minimal human feedback. We show that censoring can be accomplished with extreme human feedback efficiency and that labels generated with a mere few minutes of human feedback are sufficient.

On the EMOTIC dataset, the proposed approach achieves an Average Precision (AP) score of 27.17 in comparison to the baseline AP score of 27.38 while reducing the model size by >85%. In addition, we report an on-device AP score of 26.42 with reduction in model size by >93% when compared to the baseline.

- **Summary**: In recent years, artificial intelligence has played an important role in medicine and disease diagnosis, with many applications to be mentioned, one of which is Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA). By combining computer vision and natural language processing, MedVQA systems can assist experts in extracting relevant information from medical image based on a given question and providing precise diagnostic answers. The ImageCLEFmed-MEDVQA-GI-2023 challenge carried out visual question answering task in the gastrointestinal domain, which includes gastroscopy and colonoscopy images. Our team approached Task 1 of the challenge by proposing a multimodal learning method with image enhancement to improve the VQA performance on gastrointestinal images. The multimodal architecture is set up with BERT encoder and different pre-trained vision models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer architecture for features extraction from question and endoscopy image. The result of this study highlights the dominance of Transformer-based vision models over the CNNs and demonstrates the effectiveness of the image enhancement process, with six out of the eight vision models achieving better F1-Score. Our best method, which takes advantages of BERT+BEiT fusion and image enhancement, achieves up to 87.25% accuracy and 91.85% F1-Score on the development test set, while also producing good result on the private test set with accuracy of 82.01%.

- **Summary**: We investigate performance disparities in deep classifiers. We find that the ability of classifiers to separate individuals into subgroups varies substantially across medical imaging modalities and protected characteristics; crucially, we show that this property is predictive of algorithmic bias. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluation, we find a relationship between subgroup separability, subgroup disparities, and performance degradation when models are trained on data with systematic bias such as underdiagnosis. Our findings shed new light on the question of how models become biased, providing important insights for the development of fair medical imaging AI.

- **Summary**: Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a promising direction to alleviate domain shift, they fall short of their supervised counterparts. In this work, we investigate relatively less explored semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) for medical image segmentation, where access to a few labeled target samples can improve the adaptation performance substantially. Specifically, we propose a two-stage training process. First, an encoder is pre-trained in a self-learning paradigm using a novel domain-content disentangled contrastive learning (CL) along with a pixel-level feature consistency constraint. The proposed CL enforces the encoder to learn discriminative content-specific but domain-invariant semantics on a global scale from the source and target images, whereas consistency regularization enforces the mining of local pixel-level information by maintaining spatial sensitivity. This pre-trained encoder, along with a decoder, is further fine-tuned for the downstream task, (i.e. pixel-level segmentation) using a semi-supervised setting. Furthermore, we experimentally validate that our proposed method can easily be extended for UDA settings, adding to the superiority of the proposed strategy. Upon evaluation on two domain adaptive image segmentation tasks, our proposed method outperforms the SoTA methods, both in SSDA and UDA settings.

- **Summary**: Digital humans have witnessed extensive applications in various domains, necessitating related quality assessment studies. However, there is a lack of comprehensive digital human quality assessment (DHQA) databases. To address this gap, we propose SJTU-H3D, a subjective quality assessment database specifically designed for full-body digital humans. It comprises 40 high-quality reference digital humans and 1,120 labeled distorted counterparts generated with seven types of distortions. The SJTU-H3D database can serve as a benchmark for DHQA research, allowing evaluation and refinement of processing algorithms. Further, we propose a zero-shot DHQA approach that focuses on no-reference (NR) scenarios to ensure generalization capabilities while mitigating database bias. Our method leverages semantic and distortion features extracted from projections, as well as geometry features derived from the mesh structure of digital humans. Specifically, we employ the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to measure semantic affinity and incorporate the Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) model to capture low-level distortion information. Additionally, we utilize dihedral angles as geometry descriptors to extract mesh features. By aggregating these measures, we introduce the Digital Human Quality Index (DHQI), which demonstrates significant improvements in zero-shot performance. The DHQI can also serve as a robust baseline for DHQA tasks, facilitating advancements in the field. The database and the code are available at https://github.com/zzc-1998/SJTU-H3D.

- **Summary**: Digital imaging aims to replicate realistic scenes, but Low Dynamic Range (LDR) cameras cannot represent the wide dynamic range of real scenes, resulting in under-/overexposed images. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for recovering intricate details from shadows and highlights while reconstructing High Dynamic Range (HDR) images. We formulate the problem as an image-to-image (I2I) translation task and propose a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based framework using classifier-free guidance. We incorporate a deep CNN-based autoencoder in our proposed framework to enhance the quality of the latent representation of the input LDR image used for conditioning. Moreover, we introduce a new loss function for LDR-HDR translation tasks, termed Exposure Loss. This loss helps direct gradients in the opposite direction of the saturation, further improving the results' quality. By conducting comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, we have effectively demonstrated the proficiency of our proposed method. The results indicate that a simple conditional diffusion-based method can replace the complex camera pipeline-based architectures.

- **Summary**: Tractography traces the peak directions extracted from fiber orientation distribution (FOD) suffering from ambiguous spatial correspondences between diffusion directions and fiber geometry, which is prone to producing erroneous tracks while missing true positive connections. The peaks-based tractography methods 'locally' reconstructed streamlines in 'single to single' manner, thus lacking of global information about the trend of the whole fiber bundle. In this work, we propose a novel tractography method based on a bundle-specific tractogram distribution function by using a higher-order streamline differential equation, which reconstructs the streamline bundles in 'cluster to cluster' manner. A unified framework for any higher-order streamline differential equation is presented to describe the fiber bundles with disjoint streamlines defined based on the diffusion tensor vector field. At the global level, the tractography process is simplified as the estimation of bundle-specific tractogram distribution (BTD) coefficients by minimizing the energy optimization model, and is used to characterize the relations between BTD and diffusion tensor vector under the prior guidance by introducing the tractogram bundle information to provide anatomic priors. Experiments are performed on simulated Hough, Sine, Circle data, ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge data, FiberCup data, and in vivo data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data for qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The results demonstrate that our approach can reconstruct the complex global fiber bundles directly. BTD reduces the error deviation and accumulation at the local level and shows better results in reconstructing long-range, twisting, and large fanning tracts.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples crafted by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to the benign input. After achieving nearly 100% attack success rates in white-box setting, more focus is shifted to black-box attacks, of which the transferability of adversarial examples has gained significant attention. In either case, the common gradient-based methods generally use the sign function to generate perturbations on the gradient update, that offers a roughly correct direction and has gained great success. But little work pays attention to its possible limitation. In this work, we observe that the deviation between the original gradient and the generated noise may lead to inaccurate gradient update estimation and suboptimal solutions for adversarial transferability. To this end, we propose a Sampling-based Fast Gradient Rescaling Method (S-FGRM). Specifically, we use data rescaling to substitute the sign function without extra computational cost. We further propose a Depth First Sampling method to eliminate the fluctuation of rescaling and stabilize the gradient update. Our method could be used in any gradient-based attacks and is extensible to be integrated with various input transformation or ensemble methods to further improve the adversarial transferability. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset show that our method could significantly boost the transferability of gradient-based attacks and outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: The prevalence of large-scale multimodal datasets presents unique challenges in assessing dataset quality. We propose a two-step method to analyze multimodal datasets, which leverages a small seed of human annotation to map each multimodal instance to the modalities required to process it. Our method sheds light on the importance of different modalities in datasets, as well as the relationship between them. We apply our approach to TVQA, a video question-answering dataset, and discover that most questions can be answered using a single modality, without a substantial bias towards any specific modality. Moreover, we find that more than 70% of the questions are solvable using several different single-modality strategies, e.g., by either looking at the video or listening to the audio, highlighting the limited integration of multiple modalities in TVQA. We leverage our annotation and analyze the MERLOT Reserve, finding that it struggles with image-based questions compared to text and audio, but also with auditory speaker identification. Based on our observations, we introduce a new test set that necessitates multiple modalities, observing a dramatic drop in model performance. Our methodology provides valuable insights into multimodal datasets and highlights the need for the development of more robust models.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection has a wide range of applications and is especially important in industrial quality inspection. Currently, many top-performing anomaly-detection models rely on feature-embedding methods. However, these methods do not perform well on datasets with large variations in object locations. Reconstruction-based methods use reconstruction errors to detect anomalies without considering positional differences between samples. In this study, a reconstruction-based method using the noise-to-norm paradigm is proposed, which avoids the invariant reconstruction of anomalous regions. Our reconstruction network is based on M-net and incorporates multiscale fusion and residual attention modules to enable end-to-end anomaly detection and localization. Experiments demonstrate that the method is effective in reconstructing anomalous regions into normal patterns and achieving accurate anomaly detection and localization. On the MPDD and VisA datasets, our proposed method achieved more competitive results than the latest methods, and it set a new state-of-the-art standard on the MPDD dataset.

- **Summary**: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health threat, causing millions of deaths annually. Although early diagnosis and treatment can greatly improve the chances of survival, it remains a major challenge, especially in developing countries. Recently, computer-aided tuberculosis diagnosis (CTD) using deep learning has shown promise, but progress is hindered by limited training data. To address this, we establish a large-scale dataset, namely the Tuberculosis X-ray (TBX11K) dataset, which contains 11,200 chest X-ray (CXR) images with corresponding bounding box annotations for TB areas. This dataset enables the training of sophisticated detectors for high-quality CTD. Furthermore, we propose a strong baseline, SymFormer, for simultaneous CXR image classification and TB infection area detection. SymFormer incorporates Symmetric Search Attention (SymAttention) to tackle the bilateral symmetry property of CXR images for learning discriminative features. Since CXR images may not strictly adhere to the bilateral symmetry property, we also propose Symmetric Positional Encoding (SPE) to facilitate SymAttention through feature recalibration. To promote future research on CTD, we build a benchmark by introducing evaluation metrics, evaluating baseline models reformed from existing detectors, and running an online challenge. Experiments show that SymFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TBX11K dataset. The data, code, and models will be released.

- **Summary**: Face presentation attacks (PA), also known as spoofing attacks, pose a substantial threat to biometric systems that rely on facial recognition systems, such as access control systems, mobile payments, and identity verification systems. To mitigate the spoofing risk, several video-based methods have been presented in the literature that analyze facial motion in successive video frames. However, estimating the motion between adjacent frames is a challenging task and requires high computational cost. In this paper, we rephrase the face anti-spoofing task as a motion prediction problem and introduce a deep ensemble learning model with a frame skipping mechanism. In particular, the proposed frame skipping adopts a uniform sampling approach by dividing the original video into video clips of fixed size. By doing so, every nth frame of the clip is selected to ensure that the temporal patterns can easily be perceived during the training of three different recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Motivated by the performance of individual RNNs, a meta-model is developed to improve the overall detection performance by combining the prediction of individual RNNs. Extensive experiments were performed on four datasets, and state-of-the-art performance is reported on MSU-MFSD (3.12%), Replay-Attack (11.19%), and OULU-NPU (12.23%) databases by using half total error rates (HTERs) in the most challenging cross-dataset testing scenario.

- **Summary**: In recent years large model trained on huge amount of cross-modality data, which is usually be termed as foundation model, achieves conspicuous accomplishment in many fields, such as image recognition and generation. Though achieving great success in their original application case, it is still unclear whether those foundation models can be applied to other different downstream tasks. In this paper, we conduct a short survey on the current methods for discriminative dense recognition tasks, which are built on the pretrained foundation model. And we also provide some preliminary experimental analysis of an existing open-vocabulary segmentation method based on Stable Diffusion, which indicates the current way of deploying diffusion model for segmentation is not optimal. This aims to provide insights for future research on adopting foundation model for downstream task.

- **Summary**: Video moment retrieval pursues an efficient and generalized solution to identify the specific temporal segments within an untrimmed video that correspond to a given language description. To achieve this goal, we provide a generative diffusion-based framework called MomentDiff, which simulates a typical human retrieval process from random browsing to gradual localization. Specifically, we first diffuse the real span to random noise, and learn to denoise the random noise to the original span with the guidance of similarity between text and video. This allows the model to learn a mapping from arbitrary random locations to real moments, enabling the ability to locate segments from random initialization. Once trained, MomentDiff could sample random temporal segments as initial guesses and iteratively refine them to generate an accurate temporal boundary. Different from discriminative works (e.g., based on learnable proposals or queries), MomentDiff with random initialized spans could resist the temporal location biases from datasets. To evaluate the influence of the temporal location biases, we propose two anti-bias datasets with location distribution shifts, named Charades-STA-Len and Charades-STA-Mom. The experimental results demonstrate that our efficient framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmarks, and exhibits better generalization and robustness on the proposed anti-bias datasets. The code, model, and anti-bias evaluation datasets are available at https://github.com/IMCCretrieval/MomentDiff.

- **Summary**: Despite the recent advancement in the study of removing motion blur in an image, it is still hard to deal with strong blurs. While there are limits in removing blurs from a single image, it has more potential to use multiple images, e.g., using an additional image as a reference to deblur a blurry image. A typical setting is deburring an image using a nearby sharp image(s) in a video sequence, as in the studies of video deblurring. This paper proposes a better method to use the information present in a reference image. The method does not need a strong assumption on the reference image. We can utilize an alternative shot of the identical scene, just like in video deblurring, or we can even employ a distinct image from another scene. Our method first matches local patches of the target and reference images and then fuses their features to estimate a sharp image. We employ a patch-based feature matching strategy to solve the difficult problem of matching the blurry image with the sharp reference. Our method can be integrated into pre-existing networks designed for single image deblurring. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Panoptic segmentation is the combination of semantic and instance segmentation: assign the points in a 3D point cloud to semantic categories and partition them into distinct object instances. It has many obvious applications for outdoor scene understanding, from city mapping to forest management. Existing methods struggle to segment nearby instances of the same semantic category, like adjacent pieces of street furniture or neighbouring trees, which limits their usability for inventory- or management-type applications that rely on object instances. This study explores the steps of the panoptic segmentation pipeline concerned with clustering points into object instances, with the goal to alleviate that bottleneck. We find that a carefully designed clustering strategy, which leverages multiple types of learned point embeddings, significantly improves instance segmentation. Experiments on the NPM3D urban mobile mapping dataset and the FOR-instance forest dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed strategy.



### Probabilistic and Semantic Descriptions of Image Manifolds and Their Applications

- **Summary**: This paper begins with a description of methods for estimating probability density functions for images that reflects the observation that such data is usually constrained to lie in restricted regions of the high-dimensional image space - not every pattern of pixels is an image. It is common to say that images lie on a lower-dimensional manifold in the high-dimensional space. However, although images may lie on such lower-dimensional manifolds, it is not the case that all points on the manifold have an equal probability of being images. Images are unevenly distributed on the manifold, and our task is to devise ways to model this distribution as a probability distribution. In pursuing this goal, we consider generative models that are popular in AI and computer vision community. For our purposes, generative/probabilistic models should have the properties of 1) sample generation: it should be possible to sample from this distribution according to the modelled density function, and 2) probability computation: given a previously unseen sample from the dataset of interest, one should be able to compute the probability of the sample, at least up to a normalising constant. To this end, we investigate the use of methods such as normalising flow and diffusion models. We then show that such probabilistic descriptions can be used to construct defences against adversarial attacks. In addition to describing the manifold in terms of density, we also consider how semantic interpretations can be used to describe points on the manifold. To this end, we consider an emergent language framework which makes use of variational encoders to produce a disentangled representation of points that reside on a given manifold. Trajectories between points on a manifold can then be described in terms of evolving semantic descriptions.

- **Summary**: Smartphones equipped with a multi-camera system comprising multiple cameras with different field-of-view (FoVs) are becoming more prevalent. These camera configurations are compatible with reference-based SR and video SR, which can be executed simultaneously while recording video on the device. Thus, combining these two SR methods can improve image quality. Recently, Lee et al. have presented such a method, RefVSR. In this paper, we consider how to optimally utilize the observations obtained, including input low-resolution (LR) video and reference (Ref) video. RefVSR extends conventional video SR quite simply, aggregating the LR and Ref inputs over time in a single bidirectional stream. However, considering the content difference between LR and Ref images due to their FoVs, we can derive the maximum information from the two image sequences by aggregating them independently in the temporal direction. Then, we propose an improved method, RefVSR++, which can aggregate two features in parallel in the temporal direction, one for aggregating the fused LR and Ref inputs and the other for Ref inputs over time. Furthermore, we equip RefVSR++ with enhanced mechanisms to align image features over time, which is the key to the success of video SR. We experimentally show that RefVSR++ outperforms RefVSR by over 1dB in PSNR, achieving the new state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition facilitates unobtrusive monitoring of human movements. However, determining the most effective sensor placement for optimal classification performance remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel methodology to resolve this issue, using real-time 2D pose estimations derived from video recordings of target activities. The derived skeleton data provides a unique strategy for identifying the optimal sensor location. We validate our approach through a feasibility study, applying inertial sensors to monitor 13 different activities across ten subjects. Our findings indicate that the vision-based method for sensor placement offers comparable results to the conventional deep learning approach, demonstrating its efficacy. This research significantly advances the field of Human Activity Recognition by providing a lightweight, on-device solution for determining the optimal sensor placement, thereby enhancing data anonymization and supporting a multimodal classification approach.

- **Summary**: Asymmetry is a crucial characteristic of bilateral mammograms (Bi-MG) when abnormalities are developing. It is widely utilized by radiologists for diagnosis. The question of 'what the symmetrical Bi-MG would look like when the asymmetrical abnormalities have been removed ?' has not yet received strong attention in the development of algorithms on mammograms. Addressing this question could provide valuable insights into mammographic anatomy and aid in diagnostic interpretation. Hence, we propose a novel framework, DisAsymNet, which utilizes asymmetrical abnormality transformer guided self-adversarial learning for disentangling abnormalities and symmetric Bi-MG. At the same time, our proposed method is partially guided by randomly synthesized abnormalities. We conduct experiments on three public and one in-house dataset, and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in abnormality classification, segmentation, and localization tasks. Additionally, reconstructed normal mammograms can provide insights toward better interpretable visual cues for clinical diagnosis. The code will be accessible to the public.

- **Summary**: Recently, U-shaped networks have dominated the field of medical image segmentation due to their simple and easily tuned structure. However, existing U-shaped segmentation networks: 1) mostly focus on designing complex self-attention modules to compensate for the lack of long-term dependence based on convolution operation, which increases the overall number of parameters and computational complexity of the network; 2) simply fuse the features of encoder and decoder, ignoring the connection between their spatial locations. In this paper, we rethink the above problem and build a lightweight medical image segmentation network, called SegNetr. Specifically, we introduce a novel SegNetr block that can perform local-global interactions dynamically at any stage and with only linear complexity. At the same time, we design a general information retention skip connection (IRSC) to preserve the spatial location information of encoder features and achieve accurate fusion with the decoder features. We validate the effectiveness of SegNetr on four mainstream medical image segmentation datasets, with 59\% and 76\% fewer parameters and GFLOPs than vanilla U-Net, while achieving segmentation performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, the components proposed in this paper can be applied to other U-shaped networks to improve their segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: One challenge in text-to-image (T2I) generation is the inadvertent reflection of culture gaps present in the training data, which signifies the disparity in generated image quality when the cultural elements of the input text are rarely collected in the training set. Although various T2I models have shown impressive but arbitrary examples, there is no benchmark to systematically evaluate a T2I model's ability to generate cross-cultural images. To bridge the gap, we propose a Challenging Cross-Cultural (C3) benchmark with comprehensive evaluation criteria, which can assess how well-suited a model is to a target culture. By analyzing the flawed images generated by the Stable Diffusion model on the C3 benchmark, we find that the model often fails to generate certain cultural objects. Accordingly, we propose a novel multi-modal metric that considers object-text alignment to filter the fine-tuning data in the target culture, which is used to fine-tune a T2I model to improve cross-cultural generation. Experimental results show that our multi-modal metric provides stronger data selection performance on the C3 benchmark than existing metrics, in which the object-text alignment is crucial. We release the benchmark, data, code, and generated images to facilitate future research on culturally diverse T2I generation (https://github.com/longyuewangdcu/C3-Bench).

- **Summary**: Remote sensing image super-resolution (RSISR) plays a vital role in enhancing spatial detials and improving the quality of satellite imagery. Recently, Transformer-based models have shown competitive performance in RSISR. To mitigate the quadratic computational complexity resulting from global self-attention, various methods constrain attention to a local window, enhancing its efficiency. Consequently, the receptive fields in a single attention layer are inadequate, leading to insufficient context modeling. Furthermore, while most transform-based approaches reuse shallow features through skip connections, relying solely on these connections treats shallow and deep features equally, impeding the model's ability to characterize them. To address these issues, we propose a novel transformer architecture called Cross-Spatial Pixel Integration and Cross-Stage Feature Fusion Based Transformer Network (SPIFFNet) for RSISR. Our proposed model effectively enhances global cognition and understanding of the entire image, facilitating efficient integration of features cross-stages. The model incorporates cross-spatial pixel integration attention (CSPIA) to introduce contextual information into a local window, while cross-stage feature fusion attention (CSFFA) adaptively fuses features from the previous stage to improve feature expression in line with the requirements of the current stage. We conducted comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed SPIFFNet in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Parkinson disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, as reported by the World Health Organization. In this paper, we propose a direct three-Class PD classification using two different modalities, namely, MRI and DTI. The three classes used for classification are PD, Scans Without Evidence of Dopamine Deficit and Healthy Control. We use white matter and gray matter from the MRI and fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity from the DTI to achieve our goal. We train four separate CNNs on the above four types of data. At the decision level, the outputs of the four CNN models are fused with an optimal weighted average fusion technique. We achieve an accuracy of 95.53 percentage for the direct three class classification of PD, HC and SWEDD on the publicly available PPMI database. Extensive comparisons including a series of ablation studies clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated their ability to generate synthetic samples that match a target distribution. However, from a privacy perspective, using GANs as a proxy for data sharing is not a safe solution, as they tend to embed near-duplicates of real samples in the latent space. Recent works, inspired by k-anonymity principles, address this issue through sample aggregation in the latent space, with the drawback of reducing the dataset by a factor of k. Our work aims to mitigate this problem by proposing a latent space navigation strategy able to generate diverse synthetic samples that may support effective training of deep models, while addressing privacy concerns in a principled way. Our approach leverages an auxiliary identity classifier as a guide to non-linearly walk between points in the latent space, minimizing the risk of collision with near-duplicates of real samples. We empirically demonstrate that, given any random pair of points in the latent space, our walking strategy is safer than linear interpolation. We then test our path-finding strategy combined to k-same methods and demonstrate, on two benchmarks for tuberculosis and diabetic retinopathy classification, that training a model using samples generated by our approach mitigate drops in performance, while keeping privacy preservation.

- **Summary**: U-Net style networks are commonly utilized in unsupervised image registration to predict dense displacement fields, which for high-resolution volumetric image data is a resource-intensive and time-consuming task. To tackle this challenge, we first propose Fourier-Net, which replaces the costly U-Net style expansive path with a parameter-free model-driven decoder. Instead of directly predicting a full-resolution displacement field, our Fourier-Net learns a low-dimensional representation of the displacement field in the band-limited Fourier domain which our model-driven decoder converts to a full-resolution displacement field in the spatial domain. Expanding upon Fourier-Net, we then introduce Fourier-Net+, which additionally takes the band-limited spatial representation of the images as input and further reduces the number of convolutional layers in the U-Net style network's contracting path. Finally, to enhance the registration performance, we propose a cascaded version of Fourier-Net+. We evaluate our proposed methods on three datasets, on which our proposed Fourier-Net and its variants achieve comparable results with current state-of-the art methods, while exhibiting faster inference speeds, lower memory footprint, and fewer multiply-add operations. With such small computational cost, our Fourier-Net+ enables the efficient training of large-scale 3D registration on low-VRAM GPUs.

- **Summary**: Manual assembly workers face increasing complexity in their work. Human-centered assistance systems could help, but object recognition as an enabling technology hinders sophisticated human-centered design of these systems. At the same time, activity recognition based on hand poses suffers from poor pose estimation in complex usage scenarios, such as wearing gloves. This paper presents a self-supervised pipeline for adapting hand pose estimation to specific use cases with minimal human interaction. This enables cheap and robust hand posebased activity recognition. The pipeline consists of a general machine learning model for hand pose estimation trained on a generalized dataset, spatial and temporal filtering to account for anatomical constraints of the hand, and a retraining step to improve the model. Different parameter combinations are evaluated on a publicly available and annotated dataset. The best parameter and model combination is then applied to unlabelled videos from a manual assembly scenario. The effectiveness of the pipeline is demonstrated by training an activity recognition as a downstream task in the manual assembly scenario.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has become a valuable tool for the automation of certain medical image segmentation tasks, significantly relieving the workload of medical specialists. Some of these tasks require segmentation to be performed on a subset of the input dimensions, the most common case being 3D-to-2D. However, the performance of existing methods is strongly conditioned by the amount of labeled data available, as there is currently no data efficient method, e.g. transfer learning, that has been validated on these tasks. In this work, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) and self-supervised learning (SSL) method for label-efficient 3D-to-2D segmentation. The CNN is composed of a 3D encoder and a 2D decoder connected by novel 3D-to-2D blocks. The SSL method consists of reconstructing image pairs of modalities with different dimensionality. The approach has been validated in two tasks with clinical relevance: the en-face segmentation of geographic atrophy and reticular pseudodrusen in optical coherence tomography. Results on different datasets demonstrate that the proposed CNN significantly improves the state of the art in scenarios with limited labeled data by up to 8% in Dice score. Moreover, the proposed SSL method allows further improvement of this performance by up to 23%, and we show that the SSL is beneficial regardless of the network architecture.

- **Summary**: With the rise of Extended Reality (XR) technology, there is a growing need for real-time light field generation from sparse view inputs. Existing methods can be classified into offline techniques, which can generate high-quality novel views but at the cost of long inference/training time, and online methods, which either lack generalizability or produce unsatisfactory results. However, we have observed that the intrinsic sparse manifold of Multi-plane Images (MPI) enables a significant acceleration of light field generation while maintaining rendering quality. Based on this insight, we introduce EffLiFe, a novel light field optimization method, which leverages the proposed Hierarchical Sparse Gradient Descent (HSGD) to produce high-quality light fields from sparse view images in real time. Technically, the coarse MPI of a scene is first generated using a 3D CNN, and it is further sparsely optimized by focusing only on important MPI gradients in a few iterations. Nevertheless, relying solely on optimization can lead to artifacts at occlusion boundaries. Therefore, we propose an occlusion-aware iterative refinement module that removes visual artifacts in occluded regions by iteratively filtering the input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves comparable visual quality while being 100x faster on average than state-of-the-art offline methods and delivering better performance (about 2 dB higher in PSNR) compared to other online approaches.

- **Summary**: Patch classification models based on deep learning have been utilized in whole-slide images (WSI) of H&E-stained tissue samples to assist pathologists in grading follicular lymphoma patients. However, these approaches still require pathologists to manually identify centroblast cells and provide refined labels for optimal performance. To address this, we propose PseudoCell, an object detection framework to automate centroblast detection in WSI (source code is available at https://github.com/IoBT-VISTEC/PseudoCell.git). This framework incorporates centroblast labels from pathologists and combines them with pseudo-negative labels obtained from undersampled false-positive predictions using the cell's morphological features. By employing PseudoCell, pathologists' workload can be reduced as it accurately narrows down the areas requiring their attention during examining tissue. Depending on the confidence threshold, PseudoCell can eliminate 58.18-99.35% of non-centroblasts tissue areas on WSI. This study presents a practical centroblast prescreening method that does not require pathologists' refined labels for improvement. Detailed guidance on the practical implementation of PseudoCell is provided in the discussion section.

- **Summary**: In recent years, Transformers, initially developed for language, have been successfully applied to visual tasks. Vision Transformers have been shown to push the state-of-the-art in a wide range of tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. While ample research has shown promising results in art attribution and art authentication tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks, this paper examines if the superiority of Vision Transformers extends to art authentication, improving, thus, the reliability of computer-based authentication of artworks. Using a carefully compiled dataset of authentic paintings by Vincent van Gogh and two contrast datasets, we compare the art authentication performances of Swin Transformers with those of EfficientNet. Using a standard contrast set containing imitations and proxies (works by painters with styles closely related to van Gogh), we find that EfficientNet achieves the best performance overall. With a contrast set that only consists of imitations, we find the Swin Transformer to be superior to EfficientNet by achieving an authentication accuracy of over 85%. These results lead us to conclude that Vision Transformers represent a strong and promising contender in art authentication, particularly in enhancing the computer-based ability to detect artistic imitations.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel framework for few-shot learning by leveraging large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP. Motivated by the unimodal prototypical networks for few-shot learning, we introduce PROTO-CLIP that utilizes image prototypes and text prototypes for few-shot learning. Specifically, PROTO-CLIP adapts the image encoder and text encoder in CLIP in a joint fashion using few-shot examples. The two encoders are used to compute prototypes of image classes for classification. During adaptation, we propose aligning the image and text prototypes of corresponding classes. Such a proposed alignment is beneficial for few-shot classification due to the contributions from both types of prototypes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by conducting experiments on benchmark datasets for few-shot learning as well as in the real world for robot perception.

- **Summary**: Previous works on unsupervised industrial anomaly detection mainly focus on local structural anomalies such as cracks and color contamination. While achieving significantly high detection performance on this kind of anomaly, they are faced with logical anomalies that violate the long-range dependencies such as a normal object placed in the wrong position. In this paper, based on previous knowledge distillation works, we propose to use two students (local and global) to better mimic the teacher's behavior. The local student, which is used in previous studies mainly focuses on structural anomaly detection while the global student pays attention to logical anomalies. To further encourage the global student's learning to capture long-range dependencies, we design the global context condensing block (GCCB) and propose a contextual affinity loss for the student training and anomaly scoring. Experimental results show the proposed method doesn't need cumbersome training techniques and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have shown surprising performance in generating high-quality images. However, concerns have arisen regarding the unauthorized usage of data during the training process. One example is when a model trainer collects a set of images created by a particular artist and attempts to train a model capable of generating similar images without obtaining permission from the artist. To address this issue, it becomes crucial to detect unauthorized data usage. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting such unauthorized data usage by planting injected memorization into the text-to-image diffusion models trained on the protected dataset. Specifically, we modify the protected image dataset by adding unique contents on the images such as stealthy image wrapping functions that are imperceptible to human vision but can be captured and memorized by diffusion models. By analyzing whether the model has memorization for the injected content (i.e., whether the generated images are processed by the chosen post-processing function), we can detect models that had illegally utilized the unauthorized data. Our experiments conducted on Stable Diffusion and LoRA model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting unauthorized data usages.

- **Summary**: Search spaces hallmark the advancement of Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Large and complex search spaces with versatile building operators and structures provide more opportunities to brew promising architectures, yet pose severe challenges on efficient exploration and exploitation. Subsequently, several search space shrinkage methods optimize by selecting a single sub-region that contains some well-performing networks. Small performance and efficiency gains are observed with these methods but such techniques leave room for significantly improved search performance and are ineffective at retaining architectural diversity. We propose LISSNAS, an automated algorithm that shrinks a large space into a diverse, small search space with SOTA search performance. Our approach leverages locality, the relationship between structural and performance similarity, to efficiently extract many pockets of well-performing networks. We showcase our method on an array of search spaces spanning various sizes and datasets. We accentuate the effectiveness of our shrunk spaces when used in one-shot search by achieving the best Top-1 accuracy in two different search spaces. Our method achieves a SOTA Top-1 accuracy of 77.6\% in ImageNet under mobile constraints, best-in-class Kendal-Tau, architectural diversity, and search space size.

- **Summary**: Urban region embedding is an important and yet highly challenging issue due to the complexity and constantly changing nature of urban data. To address the challenges, we propose a Region-Wise Multi-View Representation Learning (ROMER) to capture multi-view dependencies and learn expressive representations of urban regions without the constraints of rigid neighbourhood region conditions. Our model focus on learn urban region representation from multi-source urban data. First, we capture the multi-view correlations from mobility flow patterns, POI semantics and check-in dynamics. Then, we adopt global graph attention networks to learn similarity of any two vertices in graphs. To comprehensively consider and share features of multiple views, a two-stage fusion module is further proposed to learn weights with external attention to fuse multi-view embeddings. Extensive experiments for two downstream tasks on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 17\% improvement.

- **Summary**: In this paper we demonstrate how sub-Riemannian geometry can be used for manifold learning and surface reconstruction by combining local linear approximations of a point cloud to obtain lower dimensional bundles. Local approximations obtained by local PCAs are collected into a rank $k$ tangent subbundle on $\mathbb{R}^d$, $k<d$, which we call a principal subbundle. This determines a sub-Riemannian metric on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that sub-Riemannian geodesics with respect to this metric can successfully be applied to a number of important problems, such as: explicit construction of an approximating submanifold $M$, construction of a representation of the point-cloud in $\mathbb{R}^k$, and computation of distances between observations, taking the learned geometry into account. The reconstruction is guaranteed to equal the true submanifold in the limit case where tangent spaces are estimated exactly. Via simulations, we show that the framework is robust when applied to noisy data. Furthermore, the framework generalizes to observations on an a priori known Riemannian manifold.

- **Summary**: Large web-sourced multimodal datasets have powered a slew of new methods for learning general-purpose visual representations, advancing the state of the art in computer vision and revolutionizing zero- and few-shot recognition. One crucial decision facing practitioners is how, if at all, to curate these ever-larger datasets. For example, the creators of the LAION-5B dataset chose to retain only image-caption pairs whose CLIP similarity score exceeded a designated threshold. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art data filtering approach motivated by our observation that nearly 40% of LAION's images contain text that overlaps significantly with the caption. Intuitively, such data could be wasteful as it incentivizes models to perform optical character recognition rather than learning visual features. However, naively removing all such data could also be wasteful, as it throws away images that contain visual features (in addition to overlapping text). Our simple and scalable approach, T-MARS (Text Masking and Re-Scoring), filters out only those pairs where the text dominates the remaining visual features -- by first masking out the text and then filtering out those with a low CLIP similarity score of the masked image. Experimentally, T-MARS outperforms the top-ranked method on the "medium scale" of DataComp (a data filtering benchmark) by a margin of 6.5% on ImageNet and 4.7% on VTAB. Additionally, our systematic evaluation on various data pool sizes from 2M to 64M shows that the accuracy gains enjoyed by T-MARS linearly increase as data and compute are scaled exponentially.

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a technique aimed at enhancing the generalization performance of models by leveraging unlabeled samples solely during prediction. Given the need for robustness in neural network systems when faced with distribution shifts, numerous TTA methods have recently been proposed. However, evaluating these methods is often done under different settings, such as varying distribution shifts, backbones, and designing scenarios, leading to a lack of consistent and fair benchmarks to validate their effectiveness. To address this issue, we present a benchmark that systematically evaluates 13 prominent TTA methods and their variants on five widely used image classification datasets: CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, ImageNet-C, DomainNet, and Office-Home. These methods encompass a wide range of adaptation scenarios (e.g. online adaptation v.s. offline adaptation, instance adaptation v.s. batch adaptation v.s. domain adaptation). Furthermore, we explore the compatibility of different TTA methods with diverse network backbones. To implement this benchmark, we have developed a unified framework in PyTorch, which allows for consistent evaluation and comparison of the TTA methods across the different datasets and network architectures. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a reliable means of assessing and comparing the effectiveness of TTA methods in improving model robustness and generalization performance.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models have achieved outstanding performance, but their size and computational requirements make their deployment on resource-constrained devices and time-sensitive tasks impractical. Model distillation, the process of creating smaller, faster models that maintain the performance of larger models, is a promising direction towards the solution. This paper investigates the distillation of visual representations in large teacher vision-language models into lightweight student models using a small- or mid-scale dataset. Notably, this study focuses on open-vocabulary out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, a challenging problem that has been overlooked in previous model distillation literature. We propose two principles from vision and language modality perspectives to enhance student's OOD generalization: (1) by better imitating teacher's visual representation space, and carefully promoting better coherence in vision-language alignment with the teacher; (2) by enriching the teacher's language representations with informative and finegrained semantic attributes to effectively distinguish between different labels. We propose several metrics and conduct extensive experiments to investigate their techniques. The results demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot student performance on open-vocabulary out-of-distribution classification, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.

- **Summary**: Segmentation networks are not explicitly imposed to learn global invariants of an image, such as the shape of an object and the geometry between multiple objects, when they are trained with a standard loss function. On the other hand, incorporating such invariants into network training may help improve performance for various segmentation tasks when they are the intrinsic characteristics of the objects to be segmented. One example is segmentation of aorta and great vessels in computed tomography (CT) images where vessels are found in a particular geometry in the body due to the human anatomy and they mostly seem as round objects on a 2D CT image. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a new topology-aware loss function that penalizes topology dissimilarities between the ground truth and prediction through persistent homology. Different from the previously suggested segmentation network designs, which apply the threshold filtration on a likelihood function of the prediction map and the Betti numbers of the ground truth, this paper proposes to apply the Vietoris-Rips filtration to obtain persistence diagrams of both ground truth and prediction maps and calculate the dissimilarity with the Wasserstein distance between the corresponding persistence diagrams. The use of this filtration has advantage of modeling shape and geometry at the same time, which may not happen when the threshold filtration is applied. Our experiments on 4327 CT images of 24 subjects reveal that the proposed topology-aware loss function leads to better results than its counterparts, indicating the effectiveness of this use.

- **Summary**: Everyday news coverage has shifted from traditional broadcasts towards a wide range of presentation formats such as first-hand, unedited video footage. Datasets that reflect the diverse array of multimodal, multilingual news sources available online could be used to teach models to benefit from this shift, but existing news video datasets focus on traditional news broadcasts produced for English-speaking audiences. We address this limitation by constructing MultiVENT, a dataset of multilingual, event-centric videos grounded in text documents across five target languages. MultiVENT includes both news broadcast videos and non-professional event footage, which we use to analyze the state of online news videos and how they can be leveraged to build robust, factually accurate models. Finally, we provide a model for complex, multilingual video retrieval to serve as a baseline for information retrieval using MultiVENT.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based diagnostic system has demonstrated potential in classifying skin cancer conditions when labeled training example are abundant. However, skin lesion analysis often suffers from a scarcity of labeled data, hindering the development of an accurate and reliable diagnostic system. In this work, we leverage multiple skin lesion datasets and investigate the feasibility of various unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods in binary and multi-class skin lesion classification. In particular, we assess three UDA training schemes: single-, combined-, and multi-source. Our experiment results show that UDA is effective in binary classification, with further improvement being observed when imbalance is mitigated. In multi-class task, its performance is less prominent, and imbalance problem again needs to be addressed to achieve above-baseline accuracy. Through our quantitative analysis, we find that the test error of multi-class tasks is strongly correlated with label shift, and feature-level UDA methods have limitations when handling imbalanced datasets. Finally, our study reveals that UDA can effectively reduce bias against minority groups and promote fairness, even without the explicit use of fairness-focused techniques.

- **Summary**: We evaluate existing foundation models video understanding capabilities using a carefully designed experiment protocol consisting of three hallmark tasks (action recognition, temporal localization, and spatiotemporal localization), eight datasets well received by the community, and four adaptation methods tailoring a foundation model (FM) for a downstream task. Moreover, we propose a scalar VideoGLUE score (VGS) to measure an FMs efficacy and efficiency when adapting to general video understanding tasks. Our main findings are as follows. First, task-specialized models significantly outperform the six FMs studied in this work, in sharp contrast to what FMs have achieved in natural language and image understanding. Second,video-native FMs, whose pretraining data contains the video modality, are generally better than image-native FMs in classifying motion-rich videos, localizing actions in time, and understanding a video of more than one action. Third, the video-native FMs can perform well on video tasks under light adaptations to downstream tasks(e.g., freezing the FM backbones), while image-native FMs win in full end-to-end finetuning. The first two observations reveal the need and tremendous opportunities to conduct research on video-focused FMs, and the last confirms that both tasks and adaptation methods matter when it comes to the evaluation of FMs.

- **Summary**: Autonomous agriculture applications (e.g., inspection, phenotyping, plucking fruits) require manipulating the plant foliage to look behind the leaves and the branches. Partial visibility, extreme clutter, thin structures, and unknown geometry and dynamics for plants make such manipulation challenging. We tackle these challenges through data-driven methods. We use self-supervision to train SRPNet, a neural network that predicts what space is revealed on execution of a candidate action on a given plant. We use SRPNet with the cross-entropy method to predict actions that are effective at revealing space beneath plant foliage. Furthermore, as SRPNet does not just predict how much space is revealed but also where it is revealed, we can execute a sequence of actions that incrementally reveal more and more space beneath the plant foliage. We experiment with a synthetic (vines) and a real plant (Dracaena) on a physical test-bed across 5 settings including 2 settings that test generalization to novel plant configurations. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of our overall method, PPG, over a competitive hand-crafted exploration method, and the effectiveness of SRPNet over a hand-crafted dynamics model and relevant ablations.

- **Summary**: Generating complete 360-degree panoramas from narrow field of view images is ongoing research as omnidirectional RGB data is not readily available. Existing GAN-based approaches face some barriers to achieving higher quality output, and have poor generalization performance over different mask types. In this paper, we present our 360-degree indoor RGB panorama outpainting model using latent diffusion models (LDM), called IPO-LDM. We introduce a new bi-modal latent diffusion structure that utilizes both RGB and depth panoramic data during training, but works surprisingly well to outpaint normal depth-free RGB images during inference. We further propose a novel technique of introducing progressive camera rotations during each diffusion denoising step, which leads to substantial improvement in achieving panorama wraparound consistency. Results show that our IPO-LDM not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB panorama outpainting, but can also produce multiple and diverse well-structured results for different types of masks.

- **Summary**: We introduce Text2Cinemagraph, a fully automated method for creating cinemagraphs from text descriptions - an especially challenging task when prompts feature imaginary elements and artistic styles, given the complexity of interpreting the semantics and motions of these images. Existing single-image animation methods fall short on artistic inputs, and recent text-based video methods frequently introduce temporal inconsistencies, struggling to keep certain regions static. To address these challenges, we propose an idea of synthesizing image twins from a single text prompt - a pair of an artistic image and its pixel-aligned corresponding natural-looking twin. While the artistic image depicts the style and appearance detailed in our text prompt, the realistic counterpart greatly simplifies layout and motion analysis. Leveraging existing natural image and video datasets, we can accurately segment the realistic image and predict plausible motion given the semantic information. The predicted motion can then be transferred to the artistic image to create the final cinemagraph. Our method outperforms existing approaches in creating cinemagraphs for natural landscapes as well as artistic and other-worldly scenes, as validated by automated metrics and user studies. Finally, we demonstrate two extensions: animating existing paintings and controlling motion directions using text.

- **Summary**: Visible-infrared person re-identification seeks to retrieve images of the same individual captured over a distributed network of RGB and IR sensors. Several V-I ReID approaches directly integrate both V and I modalities to discriminate persons within a shared representation space. However, given the significant gap in data distributions between V and I modalities, cross-modal V-I ReID remains challenging. Some recent approaches improve generalization by leveraging intermediate spaces that can bridge V and I modalities, yet effective methods are required to select or generate data for such informative domains. In this paper, the Adaptive Generation of Privileged Intermediate Information training approach is introduced to adapt and generate a virtual domain that bridges discriminant information between the V and I modalities. The key motivation behind AGPI^2 is to enhance the training of a deep V-I ReID backbone by generating privileged images that provide additional information. These privileged images capture shared discriminative features that are not easily accessible within the original V or I modalities alone. Towards this goal, a non-linear generative module is trained with an adversarial objective, translating V images into intermediate spaces with a smaller domain shift w.r.t. the I domain. Meanwhile, the embedding module within AGPI^2 aims to produce similar features for both V and generated images, encouraging the extraction of features that are common to all modalities. In addition to these contributions, AGPI^2 employs adversarial objectives for adapting the intermediate images, which play a crucial role in creating a non-modality-specific space to address the large domain shifts between V and I domains. Experimental results conducted on challenging V-I ReID datasets indicate that AGPI^2 increases matching accuracy without extra computational resources during inference.

- **Summary**: Recent studies on visual anomaly detection (AD) of industrial objects/textures have achieved quite good performance. They consider an unsupervised setting, specifically the one-class setting, in which we assume the availability of a set of normal (\textit{i.e.}, anomaly-free) images for training. In this paper, we consider a more challenging scenario of unsupervised AD, in which we detect anomalies in a given set of images that might contain both normal and anomalous samples. The setting does not assume the availability of known normal data and thus is completely free from human annotation, which differs from the standard AD considered in recent studies. For clarity, we call the setting blind anomaly detection (BAD). We show that BAD can be converted into a local outlier detection problem and propose a novel method named PatchCluster that can accurately detect image- and pixel-level anomalies. Experimental results show that PatchCluster shows a promising performance without the knowledge of normal data, even comparable to the SOTA methods applied in the one-class setting needing it.

- **Summary**: A 3D digital scene contains many components: lights, materials and geometries, interacting to reach the desired appearance. Staging such a scene is time-consuming and requires both artistic and technical skills. In this work, we propose PSDR-Room, a system allowing to optimize lighting as well as the pose and materials of individual objects to match a target image of a room scene, with minimal user input. To this end, we leverage a recent path-space differentiable rendering approach that provides unbiased gradients of the rendering with respect to geometry, lighting, and procedural materials, allowing us to optimize all of these components using gradient descent to visually match the input photo appearance. We use recent single-image scene understanding methods to initialize the optimization and search for appropriate 3D models and materials. We evaluate our method on real photographs of indoor scenes and demonstrate the editability of the resulting scene components.

- **Summary**: Vision language tasks, such as answering questions about or generating captions that describe an image, are difficult tasks for computers to perform. A relatively recent body of research has adapted the pretrained transformer architecture introduced in \citet{vaswani2017attention} to vision language modeling. Transformer models have greatly improved performance and versatility over previous vision language models. They do so by pretraining models on a large generic datasets and transferring their learning to new tasks with minor changes in architecture and parameter values. This type of transfer learning has become the standard modeling practice in both natural language processing and computer vision. Vision language transformers offer the promise of producing similar advancements in tasks which require both vision and language. In this paper, we provide a broad synthesis of the currently available research on vision language transformer models and offer some analysis of their strengths, limitations and some open questions that remain.

- **Summary**: Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is a premalignant histopathological diagnosis given to lesions of the oral cavity. Its grading suffers from significant inter-/intra- observer variability, and does not reliably predict malignancy progression, potentially leading to suboptimal treatment decisions. To address this, we developed a novel artificial intelligence algorithm that can assign an Oral Malignant Transformation (OMT) risk score, based on histological patterns in the in Haematoxylin and Eosin stained whole slide images, to quantify the risk of OED progression. The algorithm is based on the detection and segmentation of nuclei within (and around) the epithelium using an in-house segmentation model. We then employed a shallow neural network fed with interpretable morphological/spatial features, emulating histological markers. We conducted internal cross-validation on our development cohort (Sheffield; n = 193 cases) followed by independent validation on two external cohorts (Birmingham and Belfast; n = 92 cases). The proposed OMTscore yields an AUROC = 0.74 in predicting whether an OED progresses to malignancy or not. Survival analyses showed the prognostic value of our OMTscore for predicting malignancy transformation, when compared to the manually-assigned WHO and binary grades. Analysis of the correctly predicted cases elucidated the presence of peri-epithelial and epithelium-infiltrating lymphocytes in the most predictive patches of cases that transformed (p < 0.0001). This is the first study to propose a completely automated algorithm for predicting OED transformation based on interpretable nuclear features, whilst being validated on external datasets. The algorithm shows better-than-human-level performance for prediction of OED malignant transformation and offers a promising solution to the challenges of grading OED in routine clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Most state-of-the-art techniques for medical image segmentation rely on deep-learning models. These models, however, are often trained on narrowly-defined tasks in a supervised fashion, which requires expensive labeled datasets. Recent advances in several machine learning domains, such as natural language generation have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of building foundation models that can be customized for various downstream tasks with little to no labeled data. This likely represents a paradigm shift for medical imaging, where we expect that foundation models may shape the future of the field. In this paper, we consider a recently developed foundation model for medical image segmentation, UniverSeg. We conduct an empirical evaluation study in the context of prostate imaging and compare it against the conventional approach of training a task-specific segmentation model. Our results and discussion highlight several important factors that will likely be important in the development and adoption of foundation models for medical image segmentation.



### ADASSM: Adversarial Data Augmentation in Statistical Shape Models From Images

- **Summary**: Statistical shape models (SSM) have been well-established as an excellent tool for identifying variations in the morphology of anatomy across the underlying population. Shape models use consistent shape representation across all the samples in a given cohort, which helps to compare shapes and identify the variations that can detect pathologies and help in formulating treatment plans. In medical imaging, computing these shape representations from CT/MRI scans requires time-intensive preprocessing operations, including but not limited to anatomy segmentation annotations, registration, and texture denoising. Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in learning shape representations directly from volumetric images, giving rise to highly effective and efficient Image-to-SSM networks. Nevertheless, these models are data-hungry and due to the limited availability of medical data, deep learning models tend to overfit. Offline data augmentation techniques, that use kernel density estimation based (KDE) methods for generating shape-augmented samples, have successfully aided Image-to-SSM networks in achieving comparable accuracy to traditional SSM methods. However, these augmentation methods focus on shape augmentation, whereas deep learning models exhibit image-based texture bias resulting in sub-optimal models. This paper introduces a novel strategy for on-the-fly data augmentation for the Image-to-SSM framework by leveraging data-dependent noise generation or texture augmentation. The proposed framework is trained as an adversary to the Image-to-SSM network, augmenting diverse and challenging noisy samples. Our approach achieves improved accuracy by encouraging the model to focus on the underlying geometry rather than relying solely on pixel values.

- **Summary**: We introduce SexTok, a multi-modal dataset composed of TikTok videos labeled as sexually suggestive (from the annotator's point of view), sex-educational content, or neither. Such a dataset is necessary to address the challenge of distinguishing between sexually suggestive content and virtual sex education videos on TikTok. Children's exposure to sexually suggestive videos has been shown to have adversarial effects on their development. Meanwhile, virtual sex education, especially on subjects that are more relevant to the LGBTQIA+ community, is very valuable. The platform's current system removes or penalizes some of both types of videos, even though they serve different purposes. Our dataset contains video URLs, and it is also audio transcribed. To validate its importance, we explore two transformer-based models for classifying the videos. Our preliminary results suggest that the task of distinguishing between these types of videos is learnable but challenging. These experiments suggest that this dataset is meaningful and invites further study on the subject.

- **Summary**: Annotating medical imaging datasets is costly, so fine-tuning (or transfer learning) is the most effective method for digital pathology vision applications such as disease classification and semantic segmentation. However, due to texture bias in models trained on real-world images, transfer learning for histopathology applications might result in underperforming models, which necessitates the need for using unlabeled histopathology data and self-supervised methods to discover domain-specific characteristics. Here, we tested the premise that histopathology-specific pretrained models provide better initializations for pathology vision tasks, i.e., gland and cell segmentation. In this study, we compare the performance of gland and cell segmentation tasks with histopathology domain-specific and non-domain-specific (real-world images) pretrained weights. Moreover, we investigate the dataset size at which domain-specific pretraining produces significant gains in performance. In addition, we investigated whether domain-specific initialization improves the effectiveness of out-of-distribution testing on distinct datasets but the same task. The results indicate that performance gain using domain-specific pretrained weights depends on both the task and the size of the training dataset. In instances with limited dataset sizes, a significant improvement in gland segmentation performance was also observed, whereas models trained on cell segmentation datasets exhibit no improvement.

- **Summary**: The development of successful artificial intelligence models for chest X-ray analysis relies on large, diverse datasets with high-quality annotations. While several databases of chest X-ray images have been released, most include disease diagnosis labels but lack detailed pixel-level anatomical segmentation labels. To address this gap, we introduce an extensive chest X-ray multi-center segmentation dataset with uniform and fine-grain anatomical annotations for images coming from six well-known publicly available databases: CANDID-PTX, ChestX-ray8, Chexpert, MIMIC-CXR-JPG, Padchest, and VinDr-CXR, resulting in 676,803 segmentation masks. Our methodology utilizes the HybridGNet model to ensure consistent and high-quality segmentations across all datasets. Rigorous validation, including expert physician evaluation and automatic quality control, was conducted to validate the resulting masks. Additionally, we provide individualized quality indices per mask and an overall quality estimation per dataset. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for the broader scientific community, streamlining the development and assessment of innovative methodologies in chest X-ray analysis.

- **Summary**: MOBIO is a bi-modal database that was captured almost exclusively on mobile phones. It aims to improve research into deploying biometric techniques to mobile devices. Research has been shown that face and speaker recognition can be performed in a mobile environment. Facial landmark localization aims at finding the coordinates of a set of pre-defined key points for 2D face images. A facial landmark usually has specific semantic meaning, e.g. nose tip or eye centre, which provides rich geometric information for other face analysis tasks such as face recognition, emotion estimation and 3D face reconstruction. Pretty much facial landmark detection methods adopt still face databases, such as 300W, AFW, AFLW, or COFW, for evaluation, but seldomly use mobile data. Our work is first to perform facial landmark detection evaluation on the mobile still data, i.e., face images from MOBIO database. About 20,600 face images have been extracted from this audio-visual database and manually labeled with 22 landmarks as the groundtruth. Several state-of-the-art facial landmark detection methods are adopted to evaluate their performance on these data. The result shows that the data from MOBIO database is pretty challenging. This database can be a new challenging one for facial landmark detection evaluation.
