- **Summary**: In federated learning, data heterogeneity is a critical challenge. A straightforward solution is to shuffle the clients' data to homogenize the distribution. However, this may violate data access rights, and how and when shuffling can accelerate the convergence of a federated optimization algorithm is not theoretically well understood. In this paper, we establish a precise and quantifiable correspondence between data heterogeneity and parameters in the convergence rate when a fraction of data is shuffled across clients. We prove that shuffling can quadratically reduce the gradient dissimilarity with respect to the shuffling percentage, accelerating convergence. Inspired by the theory, we propose a practical approach that addresses the data access rights issue by shuffling locally generated synthetic data. The experimental results show that shuffling synthetic data improves the performance of multiple existing federated learning algorithms by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Most recent 6D object pose methods use 2D optical flow to refine their results. However, the general optical flow methods typically do not consider the target's 3D shape information during matching, making them less effective in 6D object pose estimation. In this work, we propose a shape-constraint recurrent matching framework for 6D object pose estimation. We first compute a pose-induced flow based on the displacement of 2D reprojection between the initial pose and the currently estimated pose, which embeds the target's 3D shape implicitly. Then we use this pose-induced flow to construct the correlation map for the following matching iterations, which reduces the matching space significantly and is much easier to learn. Furthermore, we use networks to learn the object pose based on the current estimated flow, which facilitates the computation of the pose-induced flow for the next iteration and yields an end-to-end system for object pose. Finally, we optimize the optical flow and object pose simultaneously in a recurrent manner. We evaluate our method on three challenging 6D object pose datasets and show that it outperforms the state of the art significantly in both accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: The Long-Tailed Recognition (LTR) problem emerges in the context of learning from highly imbalanced datasets, in which the number of samples among different classes is heavily skewed. LTR methods aim to accurately learn a dataset comprising both a larger Head set and a smaller Tail set. We propose a theorem where under the assumption of strong convexity of the loss function, the weights of a learner trained on the full dataset are within an upper bound of the weights of the same learner trained strictly on the Head. Next, we assert that by treating the learning of the Head and Tail as two separate and sequential steps, Continual Learning (CL) methods can effectively update the weights of the learner to learn the Tail without forgetting the Head. First, we validate our theoretical findings with various experiments on the toy MNIST-LT dataset. We then evaluate the efficacy of several CL strategies on multiple imbalanced variations of two standard LTR benchmarks (CIFAR100-LT and CIFAR10-LT), and show that standard CL methods achieve strong performance gains in comparison to baselines and approach solutions that have been tailor-made for LTR. We also assess the applicability of CL techniques on real-world data by exploring CL on the naturally imbalanced Caltech256 dataset and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art classifiers. Our work not only unifies LTR and CL but also paves the way for leveraging advances in CL methods to tackle the LTR challenge more effectively.

- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is considered the gold standard of medical imaging because of the excellent soft-tissue contrast exhibited in the images reconstructed by the MRI pipeline, which in-turn enables the human radiologist to discern many pathologies easily. More recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have also achieved state-of-the-art performance in diagnosing multiple diseases using these reconstructed images as input. However, the image reconstruction process within the MRI pipeline, which requires the use of complex hardware and adjustment of a large number of scanner parameters, is highly susceptible to noise of various forms, resulting in arbitrary artifacts within the images. Furthermore, the noise distribution is not stationary and varies within a machine, across machines, and patients, leading to varying artifacts within the images. Unfortunately, DL models are quite sensitive to these varying artifacts as it leads to changes in the input data distribution between the training and testing phases. The lack of robustness of these models against varying artifacts impedes their use in medical applications where safety is critical. In this work, we focus on improving the generalization performance of these models in the presence of multiple varying artifacts that manifest due to the complexity of the MR data acquisition. In our experiments, we observe that Batch Normalization, a widely used technique during the training of DL models for medical image analysis, is a significant cause of performance degradation in these changing environments. As a solution, we propose to use other normalization techniques, such as Group Normalization and Layer Normalization (LN), to inject robustness into model performance against varying image artifacts. Through a systematic set of experiments, we show that GN and LN provide better accuracy for various MR artifacts and distribution shifts.

- **Summary**: Among the existing modalities for 3D action recognition, 3D flow has been poorly examined, although conveying rich motion information cues for human actions. Presumably, its susceptibility to noise renders it intractable, thus challenging the learning process within deep models. This work demonstrates the use of 3D flow sequence by a deep spatiotemporal model and further proposes an incremental two-level spatial attention mechanism, guided from skeleton domain, for emphasizing motion features close to the body joint areas and according to their informativeness. Towards this end, an extended deep skeleton model is also introduced to learn the most discriminant action motion dynamics, so as to estimate an informativeness score for each joint. Subsequently, a late fusion scheme is adopted between the two models for learning the high level cross-modal correlations. Experimental results on the currently largest and most challenging dataset NTU RGB+D, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained considerable interest in recent times for its remarkable performance and has emerged as a foundational model in computer vision. It has been integrated in diverse downstream tasks, showcasing its strong zero-shot transfer capabilities. Given its impressive performance, there is a strong desire to apply SAM in autonomous driving to improve the performance of vision tasks, particularly in challenging scenarios such as driving under adverse weather conditions. However, its robustness under adverse weather conditions remains uncertain. In this work, we investigate the application of SAM in autonomous driving and specifically explore its robustness under adverse weather conditions. Overall, this work aims to enhance understanding of SAM's robustness in challenging scenarios before integrating it into autonomous driving vision tasks, providing valuable insights for future applications.

- **Summary**: Transfer learning has emerged as a key approach in the machine learning domain, enabling the application of knowledge derived from one domain to improve performance on subsequent tasks. Given the often limited information about these subsequent tasks, a strong transfer learning approach calls for the model to capture a diverse range of features during the initial pretraining stage. However, recent research suggests that, without sufficient regularization, the network tends to concentrate on features that primarily reduce the pretraining loss function. This tendency can result in inadequate feature learning and impaired generalization capability for target tasks. To address this issue, we propose Variance-Covariance Regularization (VCR), a regularization technique aimed at fostering diversity in the learned network features. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in the self-supervised learning approach, our approach promotes learned representations that exhibit high variance and minimal covariance, thus preventing the network from focusing solely on loss-reducing features.   We empirically validate the efficacy of our method through comprehensive experiments coupled with in-depth analytical studies on the learned representations. In addition, we develop an efficient implementation strategy that assures minimal computational overhead associated with our method. Our results indicate that VCR is a powerful and efficient method for enhancing transfer learning performance for both supervised learning and self-supervised learning, opening new possibilities for future research in this domain.

- **Summary**: Deep learning (DL)-based rib fracture detection has shown promise of playing an important role in preventing mortality and improving patient outcome. Normally, developing DL-based object detection models requires huge amount of bounding box annotation. However, annotating medical data is time-consuming and expertise-demanding, making obtaining a large amount of fine-grained annotations extremely infeasible. This poses pressing need of developing label-efficient detection models to alleviate radiologists' labeling burden. To tackle this challenge, the literature of object detection has witnessed an increase of weakly-supervised and semi-supervised approaches, yet still lacks a unified framework that leverages various forms of fully-labeled, weakly-labeled, and unlabeled data. In this paper, we present a novel omni-supervised object detection network, ORF-Netv2, to leverage as much available supervision as possible. Specifically, a multi-branch omni-supervised detection head is introduced with each branch trained with a specific type of supervision. A co-training-based dynamic label assignment strategy is then proposed to enable flexibly and robustly learning from the weakly-labeled and unlabeled data. Extensively evaluation was conducted for the proposed framework with three rib fracture datasets on both chest CT and X-ray. By leveraging all forms of supervision, ORF-Netv2 achieves mAPs of 34.7, 44.7, and 19.4 on the three datasets, respectively, surpassing the baseline detector which uses only box annotations by mAP gains of 3.8, 4.8, and 5.0, respectively. Furthermore, ORF-Netv2 consistently outperforms other competitive label-efficient methods over various scenarios, showing a promising framework for label-efficient fracture detection.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel quantum-mechanical model that describes psychological phenomena using the analogy of a harmonic oscillator represented by an electron trapped in a potential well. Study~1 demonstrates the application of the proposed model to bistable perception of ambiguous figures (i.e., optical illusions), exemplified by the Necker cube. While prior research has theoretically linked quantum mechanics to psychological phenomena, in Study~2 we demonstrate a viable physiological connection between physics and bistable perception. To that end, the model draws parallels between quantum tunneling of an electron through a potential energy barrier and an eye blink, an action known to trigger perceptual reversals. Finally, we discuss the ability of the model to capture diverse optical illusions and other psychological phenomena, including cognitive dissonance.

- **Summary**: While automotive radar sensors are widely adopted and have been used for automatic cruise control and collision avoidance tasks, their application outside of vehicles is still limited. As they have the ability to resolve multiple targets in 3D space, radars can also be used for improving environment perception. This application, however, requires a precise calibration, which is usually a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. We, therefore, present an approach for automated and geo-referenced extrinsic calibration of automotive radar sensors that is based on a novel hypothesis filtering scheme. Our method does not require external modifications of a vehicle and instead uses the location data obtained from automated vehicles. This location data is then combined with filtered sensor data to create calibration hypotheses. Subsequent filtering and optimization recovers the correct calibration. Our evaluation on data from a real testing site shows that our method can correctly calibrate infrastructure sensors in an automated manner, thus enabling cooperative driving scenarios.

- **Summary**: Photometric stereo leverages variations in illumination conditions to reconstruct per-pixel surface normals. The concept of display photometric stereo, which employs a conventional monitor as an illumination source, has the potential to overcome limitations often encountered in bulky and difficult-to-use conventional setups. In this paper, we introduce Differentiable Display Photometric Stereo (DDPS), a method designed to achieve high-fidelity normal reconstruction using an off-the-shelf monitor and camera. DDPS addresses a critical yet often neglected challenge in photometric stereo: the optimization of display patterns for enhanced normal reconstruction. We present a differentiable framework that couples basis-illumination image formation with a photometric-stereo reconstruction method. This facilitates the learning of display patterns that leads to high-quality normal reconstruction through automatic differentiation. Addressing the synthetic-real domain gap inherent in end-to-end optimization, we propose the use of a real-world photometric-stereo training dataset composed of 3D-printed objects. Moreover, to reduce the ill-posed nature of photometric stereo, we exploit the linearly polarized light emitted from the monitor to optically separate diffuse and specular reflections in the captured images. We demonstrate that DDPS allows for learning display patterns optimized for a target configuration and is robust to initialization. We assess DDPS on 3D-printed objects with ground-truth normals and diverse real-world objects, validating that DDPS enables effective photometric-stereo reconstruction.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a deep-learning model for deformable registration of ultrasound images at online rates, which we call U-RAFT. As its name suggests, U-RAFT is based on RAFT, a convolutional neural network for estimating optical flow. U-RAFT, however, can be trained in an unsupervised manner and can generate synthetic images for training vessel segmentation models. We propose and compare the registration quality of different loss functions for training U-RAFT. We also show how our approach, together with a robot performing force-controlled scans, can be used to generate synthetic deformed images to significantly expand the size of a femoral vessel segmentation training dataset without the need for additional manual labeling. We validate our approach on both a silicone human tissue phantom as well as on in-vivo porcine images. We show that U-RAFT generates synthetic ultrasound images with 98% and 81% structural similarity index measure (SSIM) to the real ultrasound images for the phantom and porcine datasets, respectively. We also demonstrate that synthetic deformed images from U-RAFT can be used as a data augmentation technique for vessel segmentation models to improve intersection-over-union (IoU) segmentation performance

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning model for deformable registration of ultrasound images and an unsupervised approach to training this model. Our network employs recurrent all-pairs field transforms (RAFT) and a spatial transformer network (STN) to generate displacement fields at online rates (apprx. 30 Hz) and accurately track pixel movement. We call our approach unsupervised recurrent all-pairs field transforms (U-RAFT). In this work, we use U-RAFT to track pixels in a sequence of ultrasound images to cancel out respiratory motion in lung ultrasound images. We demonstrate our method on in-vivo porcine lung videos. We show a reduction of 76% in average pixel movement in the porcine dataset using respiratory motion compensation strategy. We believe U-RAFT is a promising tool for compensating different kinds of motions like respiration and heartbeat in ultrasound images of deformable tissue.

- **Summary**: We propose ADCLR: A ccurate and D ense Contrastive Representation Learning, a novel self-supervised learning framework for learning accurate and dense vision representation. To extract spatial-sensitive information, ADCLR introduces query patches for contrasting in addition with global contrasting. Compared with previous dense contrasting methods, ADCLR mainly enjoys three merits: i) achieving both global-discriminative and spatial-sensitive representation, ii) model-efficient (no extra parameters in addition to the global contrasting baseline), and iii) correspondence-free and thus simpler to implement. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance for contrastive methods. On classification tasks, for ViT-S, ADCLR achieves 77.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with linear probing, outperforming our baseline (DINO) without our devised techniques as plug-in, by 0.5%. For ViT-B, ADCLR achieves 79.8%, 84.0% accuracy on ImageNet by linear probing and finetune, outperforming iBOT by 0.3%, 0.2% accuracy. For dense tasks, on MS-COCO, ADCLR achieves significant improvements of 44.3% AP on object detection, 39.7% AP on instance segmentation, outperforming previous SOTA method SelfPatch by 2.2% and 1.2%, respectively. On ADE20K, ADCLR outperforms SelfPatch by 1.0% mIoU, 1.2% mAcc on the segme

- **Summary**: The concepts of overfitting and generalization are vital for evaluating machine learning models. In this work, we show that the popular Recall@K metric depends on the number of classes in the dataset, which limits its ability to estimate generalization. To fix this issue, we propose a new metric, which measures retrieval performance, and, unlike Recall@K, estimates generalization. We apply the proposed metric to popular image retrieval methods and provide new insights about deep metric learning generalization.

- **Summary**: Structured light has proven instrumental in 3D imaging, LiDAR, and holographic light projection. Metasurfaces, comprised of sub-wavelength-sized nanostructures, facilitate 180$^\circ$ field-of-view (FoV) structured light, circumventing the restricted FoV inherent in traditional optics like diffractive optical elements. However, extant metasurface-facilitated structured light exhibits sub-optimal performance in downstream tasks, due to heuristic pattern designs such as periodic dots that do not consider the objectives of the end application. In this paper, we present neural 360$^\circ$ structured light, driven by learned metasurfaces. We propose a differentiable framework, that encompasses a computationally-efficient 180$^\circ$ wave propagation model and a task-specific reconstructor, and exploits both transmission and reflection channels of the metasurface. Leveraging a first-order optimizer within our differentiable framework, we optimize the metasurface design, thereby realizing neural 360$^\circ$ structured light. We have utilized neural 360$^\circ$ structured light for holographic light projection and 3D imaging. Specifically, we demonstrate the first 360$^\circ$ light projection of complex patterns, enabled by our propagation model that can be computationally evaluated 50,000$\times$ faster than the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld propagation. For 3D imaging, we improve depth-estimation accuracy by 5.09$\times$ in RMSE compared to the heuristically-designed structured light. Neural 360$^\circ$ structured light promises robust 360$^\circ$ imaging and display for robotics, extended-reality systems, and human-computer interactions.

- **Summary**: Lesion detection on plant leaves is a critical task in plant pathology and agricultural research. Identifying lesions enables assessing the severity of plant diseases and making informed decisions regarding disease control measures and treatment strategies. To detect lesions, there are studies that propose well-known object detectors. However, training object detectors to detect small objects such as lesions can be problematic. In this study, we propose a method for lesion detection on plant leaves utilizing class activation maps generated by a ResNet-18 classifier. In the test set, we achieved a 0.45 success rate in predicting the locations of lesions in leaves. Our study presents a novel approach for lesion detection on plant leaves by utilizing CAMs generated by a ResNet classifier while eliminating the need for a lesion annotation process.

- **Summary**: Affordance-Centric Question-driven Task Completion (AQTC) has been proposed to acquire knowledge from videos to furnish users with comprehensive and systematic instructions. However, existing methods have hitherto neglected the necessity of aligning spatiotemporal visual and linguistic signals, as well as the crucial interactional information between humans and objects. To tackle these limitations, we propose to combine large-scale pre-trained vision-language and video-language models, which serve to contribute stable and reliable multimodal data and facilitate effective spatiotemporal visual-textual alignment. Additionally, a novel hand-object-interaction (HOI) aggregation module is proposed which aids in capturing human-object interaction information, thereby further augmenting the capacity to understand the presented scenario. Our method achieved first place in the CVPR'2023 AQTC Challenge, with a Recall@1 score of 78.7\%. The code is available at https://github.com/tomchen-ctj/CVPR23-LOVEU-AQTC.

- **Summary**: We present DiffInfinite, a hierarchical diffusion model that generates arbitrarily large histological images while preserving long-range correlation structural information. Our approach first generates synthetic segmentation masks, subsequently used as conditions for the high-fidelity generative diffusion process. The proposed sampling method can be scaled up to any desired image size while only requiring small patches for fast training. Moreover, it can be parallelized more efficiently than previous large-content generation methods while avoiding tiling artefacts. The training leverages classifier-free guidance to augment a small, sparsely annotated dataset with unlabelled data. Our method alleviates unique challenges in histopathological imaging practice: large-scale information, costly manual annotation, and protective data handling. The biological plausibility of DiffInfinite data is validated in a survey by ten experienced pathologists as well as a downstream segmentation task. Furthermore, the model scores strongly on anti-copying metrics which is beneficial for the protection of patient data.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) relies on the powerful LLM to perform multimodal tasks, showing amazing emergent abilities in recent studies, such as writing poems based on an image. However, it is difficult for these case studies to fully reflect the performance of MLLM, lacking a comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we fill in this blank, presenting the first MLLM Evaluation benchmark MME. It measures both perception and cognition abilities on a total of 14 subtasks. In order to avoid data leakage that may arise from direct use of public datasets for evaluation, the annotations of instruction-answer pairs are all manually designed. The concise instruction design allows us to fairly compare MLLMs, instead of struggling in prompt engineering. Besides, with such an instruction, we can also easily carry out quantitative statistics. A total of 12 advanced MLLMs are comprehensively evaluated on our MME, which not only suggests that existing MLLMs still have a large room for improvement, but also reveals the potential directions for the subsequent model optimization.

- **Summary**: The objective of a style transfer is to maintain the content of an image while transferring the style of another image. However, conventional research on style transfer has a significant limitation in preserving facial landmarks, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, which are crucial for maintaining the identity of the image. In Korean portraits, the majority of individuals wear "Gat", a type of headdress exclusively worn by men. Owing to its distinct characteristics from the hair in ID photos, transferring the "Gat" is challenging. To address this issue, this study proposes a deep learning network that can perform style transfer, including the "Gat", while preserving the identity of the face. Unlike existing style transfer approaches, the proposed method aims to preserve texture, costume, and the "Gat" on the style image. The Generative Adversarial Network forms the backbone of the proposed network. The color, texture, and intensity were extracted differently based on the characteristics of each block and layer of the pre-trained VGG-16, and only the necessary elements during training were preserved using a facial landmark mask. The head area was presented using the eyebrow area to transfer the "Gat". Furthermore, the identity of the face was retained, and style correlation was considered based on the Gram matrix. The proposed approach demonstrated superior transfer and preservation performance compared to previous studies.

- **Summary**: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to structurally and comprehensively represent objects and their connections in images, it can significantly benefit scene understanding and other related downstream tasks. Existing SGG models often struggle to solve the long-tailed problem caused by biased datasets. However, even if these models can fit specific datasets better, it may be hard for them to resolve the unseen triples which are not included in the training set. Most methods tend to feed a whole triple and learn the overall features based on statistical machine learning. Such models have difficulty predicting unseen triples because the objects and predicates in the training set are combined differently as novel triples in the test set. In this work, we propose a Text-Image-joint Scene Graph Generation (TISGG) model to resolve the unseen triples and improve the generalisation capability of the SGG models. We propose a Joint Fearture Learning (JFL) module and a Factual Knowledge based Refinement (FKR) module to learn object and predicate categories separately at the feature level and align them with corresponding visual features so that the model is no longer limited to triples matching. Besides, since we observe the long-tailed problem also affects the generalization ability, we design a novel balanced learning strategy, including a Charater Guided Sampling (CGS) and an Informative Re-weighting (IR) module, to provide tailor-made learning methods for each predicate according to their characters. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In more detail, TISGG boosts the performances by 11.7% of zR@20(zero-shot recall) on the PredCls sub-task on the Visual Genome dataset.

- **Summary**: One of the more significant obstacles in classification of skin cancer is the presence of artifacts. This paper investigates the effect of dark corner artifacts, which result from the use of dermoscopes, on the performance of a deep learning binary classification task. Previous research attempted to remove and inpaint dark corner artifacts, with the intention of creating an ideal condition for models. However, such research has been shown to be inconclusive due to lack of available datasets labelled with dark corner artifacts and detailed analysis and discussion. To address these issues, we label 10,250 skin lesion images from publicly available datasets and introduce a balanced dataset with an equal number of melanoma and non-melanoma cases. The training set comprises 6126 images without artifacts, and the testing set comprises 4124 images with dark corner artifacts. We conduct three experiments to provide new understanding on the effects of dark corner artifacts, including inpainted and synthetically generated examples, on a deep learning method. Our results suggest that introducing synthetic dark corner artifacts which have been superimposed onto the training set improved model performance, particularly in terms of the true negative rate. This indicates that deep learning learnt to ignore dark corner artifacts, rather than treating it as melanoma, when dark corner artifacts were introduced into the training set. Further, we propose a new approach to quantifying heatmaps indicating network focus using a root mean square measure of the brightness intensity in the different regions of the heatmaps. This paper provides a new guideline for skin lesions analysis with an emphasis on reproducibility.

- **Summary**: We have proposed a self-supervised deep learning framework for solving the mesh blending problem in scenarios where the meshes are not in correspondence. To solve this problem, we have developed Red-Blue MPNN, a novel graph neural network that processes an augmented graph to estimate the correspondence. We have designed a novel conditional refinement scheme to find the exact correspondence when certain conditions are satisfied. We further develop a graph neural network that takes the aligned meshes and the time value as input and fuses this information to process further and generate the desired result. Using motion capture datasets and human mesh designing software, we create a large-scale synthetic dataset consisting of temporal sequences of human meshes in motion. Our results demonstrate that our approach generates realistic deformation of body parts given complex inputs.

- **Summary**: Neural fields have achieved impressive advancements in view synthesis and scene reconstruction. However, editing these neural fields remains challenging due to the implicit encoding of geometry and texture information. In this paper, we propose DreamEditor, a novel framework that enables users to perform controlled editing of neural fields using text prompts. By representing scenes as mesh-based neural fields, DreamEditor allows localized editing within specific regions. DreamEditor utilizes the text encoder of a pretrained text-to-Image diffusion model to automatically identify the regions to be edited based on the semantics of the text prompts. Subsequently, DreamEditor optimizes the editing region and aligns its geometry and texture with the text prompts through score distillation sampling [29]. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that DreamEditor can accurately edit neural fields of real-world scenes according to the given text prompts while ensuring consistency in irrelevant areas. DreamEditor generates highly realistic textures and geometry, significantly surpassing previous works in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: Despite that the segment anything model (SAM) achieved impressive results on general-purpose semantic segmentation with strong generalization ability on daily images, its demonstrated performance on medical image segmentation is less precise and not stable, especially when dealing with tumor segmentation tasks that involve objects of small sizes, irregular shapes, and low contrast. Notably, the original SAM architecture is designed for 2D natural images, therefore would not be able to extract the 3D spatial information from volumetric medical data effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation method for transferring SAM from 2D to 3D for promptable medical image segmentation. Through a holistically designed scheme for architecture modification, we transfer the SAM to support volumetric inputs while retaining the majority of its pre-trained parameters for reuse. The fine-tuning process is conducted in a parameter-efficient manner, wherein most of the pre-trained parameters remain frozen, and only a few lightweight spatial adapters are introduced and tuned. Regardless of the domain gap between natural and medical data and the disparity in the spatial arrangement between 2D and 3D, the transformer trained on natural images can effectively capture the spatial patterns present in volumetric medical images with only lightweight adaptations. We conduct experiments on four open-source tumor segmentation datasets, and with a single click prompt, our model can outperform domain state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models on 3 out of 4 tasks, specifically by 8.25%, 29.87%, and 10.11% for kidney tumor, pancreas tumor, colon cancer segmentation, and achieve similar performance for liver tumor segmentation. We also compare our adaptation method with existing popular adapters, and observed significant performance improvement on most datasets.

- **Summary**: The capabilities and adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) grow at an exhilarating pace: Vision models accurately classify human actions in videos and identify cancerous tissue in medical scans as precisely than human experts; large language models answer wide-ranging questions, generate code, and write prose, becoming the topic of everyday dinner-table conversations. Even though their uses are exhilarating, the continually increasing model sizes and computational complexities have a dark side. The economic cost and negative environmental externalities of training and serving models is in evident disharmony with financial viability and climate action goals.   Instead of pursuing yet another increase in predictive performance, this dissertation is dedicated to the improvement of neural network efficiency. Specifically, a core contribution addresses the efficiency aspects during online inference. Here, the concept of Continual Inference Networks (CINs) is proposed and explored across four publications. CINs extend prior state-of-the-art methods developed for offline processing of spatio-temporal data and reuse their pre-trained weights, improving their online processing efficiency by an order of magnitude. These advances are attained through a bottom-up computational reorganization and judicious architectural modifications. The benefit to online inference is demonstrated by reformulating several widely used network architectures into CINs, including 3D CNNs, ST-GCNs, and Transformer Encoders. An orthogonal contribution tackles the concurrent adaptation and computational acceleration of a large source model into multiple lightweight derived models. Drawing on fusible adapter networks and structured pruning, Structured Pruning Adapters achieve superior predictive accuracy under aggressive pruning using significantly fewer learned weights compared to fine-tuning with pruning.

- **Summary**: Color Doppler echocardiography is a widely used non-invasive imaging modality that provides real-time information about the intracardiac blood flow. In an apical long-axis view of the left ventricle, color Doppler is subject to phase wrapping, or aliasing, especially during cardiac filling and ejection. When setting up quantitative methods based on color Doppler, it is necessary to correct this wrapping artifact. We developed an unfolded primal-dual network to unwrap (dealias) color Doppler echocardiographic images and compared its effectiveness against two state-of-the-art segmentation approaches based on nnU-Net and transformer models. We trained and evaluated the performance of each method on an in-house dataset and found that the nnU-Net-based method provided the best dealiased results, followed by the primal-dual approach and the transformer-based technique. Noteworthy, the primal-dual network, which had significantly fewer trainable parameters, performed competitively with respect to the other two methods, demonstrating the high potential of deep unfolding methods. Our results suggest that deep learning-based methods can effectively remove aliasing artifacts in color Doppler echocardiographic images, outperforming DeAN, a state-of-the-art semi-automatic technique. Overall, our results show that deep learning-based methods have the potential to effectively preprocess color Doppler images for downstream quantitative analysis.

- **Summary**: Many methods based on sparse and low-rank representation been developed along with guarantees of correct outlier detection. Self-representation states that a point in a subspace can always be expressed as a linear combination of other points in the subspace. A suitable Markov Chain can be defined on the self-representation and it allows us to recognize the difference between inliers and outliers. However, the reconstruction error of self-representation that is still informative to detect outlier detection, is neglected.Inspired by the gradient boosting, in this paper, we propose a new outlier detection framework that combines a series of weak "outlier detectors" into a single strong one in an iterative fashion by constructing multi-pass self-representation. At each stage, we construct a self-representation based on elastic-net and define a suitable Markov Chain on it to detect outliers. The residual of the self-representation is used for the next stage to learn the next weaker outlier detector. Such a stage will repeat many times. And the final decision of outliers is generated by the previous all results. Experimental results on image and speaker datasets demonstrate its superiority with respect to state-of-the-art sparse and low-rank outlier detection methods.

- **Summary**: With the increasing deployment of agricultural robots, the traditional manual spray of liquid fertilizer and pesticide is gradually being replaced by agricultural robots. For robotic precision spray application in vegetable farms, accurate plant phenotyping through instance segmentation and robust plant tracking are of great importance and a prerequisite for the following spray action. Regarding the robust tracking of vegetable plants, to solve the challenging problem of associating vegetables with similar color and texture in consecutive images, in this paper, a novel method of Multiple Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) is proposed for instance segmentation and tracking of multiple vegetable plants. In our approach, contour and blob features are extracted to describe unique feature of each individual vegetable, and associate the same vegetables in different images. By assigning a unique ID for each vegetable, it ensures the robot to spray each vegetable exactly once, while traversing along the farm rows. Comprehensive experiments including ablation studies are conducted, which prove its superior performance over two State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) MOTS methods. Compared to the conventional MOTS methods, the proposed method is able to re-identify objects which have gone out of the camera field of view and re-appear again using the proposed data association strategy, which is important to ensure each vegetable be sprayed only once when the robot travels back and forth. Although the method is tested on lettuce farm, it can be applied to other similar vegetables such as broccoli and canola. Both code and the dataset of this paper is publicly released for the benefit of the community: https://github.com/NanH5837/LettuceMOTS.

- **Summary**: This paper takes an important step in bridging the performance gap between DETR and R-CNN for graphical object detection. Existing graphical object detection approaches have enjoyed recent enhancements in CNN-based object detection methods, achieving remarkable progress. Recently, Transformer-based detectors have considerably boosted the generic object detection performance, eliminating the need for hand-crafted features or post-processing steps such as Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) using object queries. However, the effectiveness of such enhanced transformer-based detection algorithms has yet to be verified for the problem of graphical object detection. Essentially, inspired by the latest advancements in the DETR, we employ the existing detection transformer with few modifications for graphical object detection. We modify object queries in different ways, using points, anchor boxes and adding positive and negative noise to the anchors to boost performance. These modifications allow for better handling of objects with varying sizes and aspect ratios, more robustness to small variations in object positions and sizes, and improved image discrimination between objects and non-objects. We evaluate our approach on the four graphical datasets: PubTables, TableBank, NTable and PubLaynet. Upon integrating query modifications in the DETR, we outperform prior works and achieve new state-of-the-art results with the mAP of 96.9\%, 95.7\% and 99.3\% on TableBank, PubLaynet, PubTables, respectively. The results from extensive ablations show that transformer-based methods are more effective for document analysis analogous to other applications. We hope this study draws more attention to the research of using detection transformers in document image analysis.

- **Summary**: The examination of blood samples at a microscopic level plays a fundamental role in clinical diagnostics, influencing a wide range of medical conditions. For instance, an in-depth study of White Blood Cells (WBCs), a crucial component of our blood, is essential for diagnosing blood-related diseases such as leukemia and anemia. While multiple datasets containing WBC images have been proposed, they mostly focus on cell categorization, often lacking the necessary morphological details to explain such categorizations, despite the importance of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in medical domains. This paper seeks to address this limitation by introducing comprehensive annotations for WBC images. Through collaboration with pathologists, a thorough literature review, and manual inspection of microscopic images, we have identified 11 morphological attributes associated with the cell and its components (nucleus, cytoplasm, and granules). We then annotated ten thousand WBC images with these attributes. Moreover, we conduct experiments to predict these attributes from images, providing insights beyond basic WBC classification. As the first public dataset to offer such extensive annotations, we also illustrate specific applications that can benefit from our attribute annotations. Overall, our dataset paves the way for interpreting WBC recognition models, further advancing XAI in the fields of pathology and hematology.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) recently has been a new rising research hotspot, which uses powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as a brain to perform multimodal tasks. The surprising emergent capabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and OCR-free math reasoning, are rare in traditional methods, suggesting a potential path to artificial general intelligence. In this paper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLM. First of all, we present the formulation of MLLM and delineate its related concepts. Then, we discuss the key techniques and applications, including Multimodal Instruction Tuning (M-IT), Multimodal In-Context Learning (M-ICL), Multimodal Chain of Thought (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). Finally, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions. In light of the fact that the era of MLLM has only just begun, we will keep updating this survey and hope it can inspire more research.

- **Summary**: Machine Learning (ML) has recently been a skyrocketing field in Computer Science. As computer hardware engineers, we are enthusiastic about hardware implementations of popular software ML architectures to optimize their performance, reliability, and resource usage. In this project, we designed a highly-configurable, real-time device for recognizing handwritten letters and digits using an Altera DE1 FPGA Kit. We followed various engineering standards, including IEEE-754 32-bit Floating-Point Standard, Video Graphics Array (VGA) display protocol, Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) protocol, and Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocols to achieve the project goals. These significantly improved our design in compatibility, reusability, and simplicity in verifications. Following these standards, we designed a 32-bit floating-point (FP) instruction set architecture (ISA). We developed a 5-stage RISC processor in System Verilog to manage image processing, matrix multiplications, ML classifications, and user interfaces. Three different ML architectures were implemented and evaluated on our design: Linear Classification (LC), a 784-64-10 fully connected neural network (NN), and a LeNet-like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with ReLU activation layers and 36 classes (10 for the digits and 26 for the case-insensitive letters). The training processes were done in Python scripts, and the resulting kernels and weights were stored in hex files and loaded into the FPGA's SRAM units. Convolution, pooling, data management, and various other ML features were guided by firmware in our custom assembly language. This paper documents the high-level design block diagrams, interfaces between each System Verilog module, implementation details of our software and firmware components, and further discussions on potential impacts.

- **Summary**: Project Sunroof estimates the solar potential of residential buildings using high quality aerial data. That is, it estimates the potential solar energy (and associated financial savings) that can be captured by buildings if solar panels were to be installed on their roofs. Unfortunately its coverage is limited by the lack of high resolution digital surface map (DSM) data. We present a deep learning approach that bridges this gap by enhancing widely available low-resolution data, thereby dramatically increasing the coverage of Sunroof. We also present some ongoing efforts to potentially improve accuracy even further by replacing certain algorithmic components of the Sunroof processing pipeline with deep learning.

- **Summary**: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a challenging task that involves modeling individual behaviors and interactions between people. Despite the emergence of approaches for this task, comparing them is difficult due to the lack of standardized training settings and benchmark datasets. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Person Interaction Motion (MI-Motion) Dataset, which includes skeleton sequences of multiple individuals collected by motion capture systems and refined and synthesized using a game engine. The dataset contains 167k frames of interacting people's skeleton poses and is categorized into 5 different activity scenes. To facilitate research in multi-person motion prediction, we also provide benchmarks to evaluate the performance of prediction methods in three settings: short-term, long-term, and ultra-long-term prediction. Additionally, we introduce a novel baseline approach that leverages graph and temporal convolutional networks, which has demonstrated competitive results in multi-person motion prediction. We believe that the proposed MI-Motion benchmark dataset and baseline will facilitate future research in this area, ultimately leading to better understanding and modeling of multi-person interactions.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel normalization method called penalty gradient normalization (PGN) to tackle the training instability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) caused by the sharp gradient space. Unlike existing work such as gradient penalty and spectral normalization, the proposed PGN only imposes a penalty gradient norm constraint on the discriminator function, which increases the capacity of the discriminator. Moreover, the proposed penalty gradient normalization can be applied to different GAN architectures with little modification. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that GANs trained with penalty gradient normalization outperform existing methods in terms of both Frechet Inception and Distance and Inception Score.

- **Summary**: Data efficiency, or the ability to generalize from a few labeled data, remains a major challenge in deep learning. Semi-supervised learning has thrived in traditional recognition tasks alleviating the need for large amounts of labeled data, yet it remains understudied in image-to-image translation (I2I) tasks. In this work, we introduce the first semi-supervised (semi-paired) framework for label-to-image translation, a challenging subtask of I2I which generates photorealistic images from semantic label maps. In the semi-paired setting, the model has access to a small set of paired data and a larger set of unpaired images and labels. Instead of using geometrical transformations as a pretext task like previous works, we leverage an input reconstruction task by exploiting the conditional discriminator on the paired data as a reverse generator. We propose a training algorithm for this shared network, and we present a rare classes sampling algorithm to focus on under-represented classes. Experiments on 3 standard benchmarks show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches, as well as some fully supervised approaches while using a much smaller number of paired samples.

- **Summary**: Currently, over half of the computing power at CERN GRID is used to run High Energy Physics simulations. The recent updates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) create the need for developing more efficient simulation methods. In particular, there exists a demand for a fast simulation of the neutron Zero Degree Calorimeter, where existing Monte Carlo-based methods impose a significant computational burden. We propose an alternative approach to the problem that leverages machine learning. Our solution utilises neural network classifiers and generative models to directly simulate the response of the calorimeter. In particular, we examine the performance of variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, expanding the GAN architecture by an additional regularisation network and a simple, yet effective postprocessing step. Our approach increases the simulation speed by 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining the high fidelity of the simulation.

- **Summary**: We introduce the task of open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. Traditional approaches for 3D instance segmentation largely rely on existing 3D annotated datasets, which are restricted to a closed-set of object categories. This is an important limitation for real-life applications where one might need to perform tasks guided by novel, open-vocabulary queries related to objects from a wide variety. Recently, open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding methods have emerged to address this problem by learning queryable features per each point in the scene. While such a representation can be directly employed to perform semantic segmentation, existing methods have limitations in their ability to identify object instances. In this work, we address this limitation, and propose OpenMask3D, which is a zero-shot approach for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. Guided by predicted class-agnostic 3D instance masks, our model aggregates per-mask features via multi-view fusion of CLIP-based image embeddings. We conduct experiments and ablation studies on the ScanNet200 dataset to evaluate the performance of OpenMask3D, and provide insights about the open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation task. We show that our approach outperforms other open-vocabulary counterparts, particularly on the long-tail distribution. Furthermore, OpenMask3D goes beyond the limitations of close-vocabulary approaches, and enables the segmentation of object instances based on free-form queries describing object properties such as semantics, geometry, affordances, and material properties.

- **Summary**: We introduce LightGlue, a deep neural network that learns to match local features across images. We revisit multiple design decisions of SuperGlue, the state of the art in sparse matching, and derive simple but effective improvements. Cumulatively, they make LightGlue more efficient - in terms of both memory and computation, more accurate, and much easier to train. One key property is that LightGlue is adaptive to the difficulty of the problem: the inference is much faster on image pairs that are intuitively easy to match, for example because of a larger visual overlap or limited appearance change. This opens up exciting prospects for deploying deep matchers in latency-sensitive applications like 3D reconstruction. The code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/cvg/LightGlue.

- **Summary**: Image restoration aims to reconstruct degraded images, e.g., denoising or deblurring. Existing works focus on designing task-specific methods and there are inadequate attempts at universal methods. However, simply unifying multiple tasks into one universal architecture suffers from uncontrollable and undesired predictions. To address those issues, we explore prompt learning in universal architectures for image restoration tasks. In this paper, we present Degradation-aware Visual Prompts, which encode various types of image degradation, e.g., noise and blur, into unified visual prompts. These degradation-aware prompts provide control over image processing and allow weighted combinations for customized image restoration. We then leverage degradation-aware visual prompts to establish a controllable and universal model for image restoration, called ProRes, which is applicable to an extensive range of image restoration tasks. ProRes leverages the vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) without any task-specific designs. Furthermore, the pre-trained ProRes can easily adapt to new tasks through efficient prompt tuning with only a few images. Without bells and whistles, ProRes achieves competitive performance compared to task-specific methods and experiments can demonstrate its ability for controllable restoration and adaptation for new tasks. The code and models will be released in \url{https://github.com/leonmakise/ProRes}.

- **Summary**: Recent diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown remarkable abilities of generated content, however, they often suffer from complex forward processes, resulting in inefficient solutions for the reversed process and prolonged sampling times. In this paper, we aim to address the aforementioned challenges by focusing on the diffusion process itself that we propose to decouple the intricate diffusion process into two comparatively simpler process to improve the generative efficacy and speed. In particular, we present a novel diffusion paradigm named DDM (Decoupled Diffusion Models) based on the Ito diffusion process, in which the image distribution is approximated by an explicit transition probability while the noise path is controlled by the standard Wiener process. We find that decoupling the diffusion process reduces the learning difficulty and the explicit transition probability improves the generative speed significantly. We prove a new training objective for DPM, which enables the model to learn to predict the noise and image components separately. Moreover, given the novel forward diffusion equation, we derive the reverse denoising formula of DDM that naturally supports fewer steps of generation without ordinary differential equation (ODE) based accelerators. Our experiments demonstrate that DDM outperforms previous DPMs by a large margin in fewer function evaluations setting and gets comparable performances in long function evaluations setting. We also show that our framework can be applied to image-conditioned generation and high-resolution image synthesis, and that it can generate high-quality images with only 10 function evaluations.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles and driving systems use scene parsing as an essential tool to understand the surrounding environment. Panoptic segmentation is a state-of-the-art technique which proves to be pivotal in this use case. Deep learning-based architectures have been utilized for effective and efficient Panoptic Segmentation in recent times. However, when it comes to adverse conditions like dark scenes with poor illumination or nighttime images, existing methods perform poorly in comparison to daytime images. One of the main factors for poor results is the lack of sufficient and accurately annotated nighttime images for urban driving scenes. In this work, we propose two new methods, first to improve the performance, and second to improve the robustness of panoptic segmentation in nighttime or poor illumination urban driving scenes using a domain translation approach. The proposed approach makes use of CycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017) to translate daytime images with existing panoptic annotations into nighttime images, which are then utilized to retrain a Panoptic segmentation model to improve performance and robustness under poor illumination and nighttime conditions. In our experiments, Approach-1 demonstrates a significant improvement in the Panoptic segmentation performance on the converted Cityscapes dataset with more than +10% PQ, +12% RQ, +2% SQ, +14% mIoU and +10% AP50 absolute gain. Approach-2 demonstrates improved robustness to varied nighttime driving environments. Both the approaches are supported via comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis.

- **Summary**: The emerging scale segmentation model, Segment Anything (SAM), exhibits impressive capabilities in zero-shot segmentation for natural images. However, when applied to medical images, SAM suffers from noticeable performance drop. To make SAM a real ``foundation model" for the computer vision community, it is critical to find an efficient way to customize SAM for medical image dataset. In this work, we propose to freeze SAM encoder and finetune a lightweight task-specific prediction head, as most of weights in SAM are contributed by the encoder. In addition, SAM is a promptable model, while prompt is not necessarily available in all application cases, and precise prompts for multiple class segmentation are also time-consuming. Therefore, we explore three types of prompt-free prediction heads in this work, include ViT, CNN, and linear layers. For ViT head, we remove the prompt tokens in the mask decoder of SAM, which is named AutoSAM. AutoSAM can also generate masks for different classes with one single inference after modification. To evaluate the label-efficiency of our finetuning method, we compare the results of these three prediction heads on a public medical image segmentation dataset with limited labeled data. Experiments demonstrate that finetuning SAM significantly improves its performance on medical image dataset, even with just one labeled volume. Moreover, AutoSAM and CNN prediction head also has better segmentation accuracy than training from scratch and self-supervised learning approaches when there is a shortage of annotations.

- **Summary**: The use of supervised learning for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on mobile devices leads to strong classification performances. Such an approach, however, requires large amounts of labeled data, both for the initial training of the models and for their customization on specific clients (whose data often differ greatly from the training data). This is actually impractical to obtain due to the costs, intrusiveness, and time-consuming nature of data annotation. Moreover, even with the help of a significant amount of labeled data, model deployment on heterogeneous clients faces difficulties in generalizing well on unseen data. Other domains, like Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing, have proposed the notion of pre-trained models, leveraging large corpora, to reduce the need for annotated data and better manage heterogeneity. This promising approach has not been implemented in the HAR domain so far because of the lack of public datasets of sufficient size. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to combine publicly available datasets with the goal of learning a generalized HAR model that can be fine-tuned using a limited amount of labeled data on an unseen target domain. Our experimental evaluation, which includes experimenting with different state-of-the-art neural network architectures, shows that combining public datasets can significantly reduce the number of labeled samples required to achieve satisfactory performance on an unseen target domain.

- **Summary**: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the state of the art in generative image modelling and allow for an intuitive and powerful user interface to drive the image generation process. Expressing spatial constraints, e.g. to position specific objects in particular locations, is cumbersome using text; and current text-based image generation models are not able to accurately follow such instructions. In this paper we consider image generation from text associated with segments on the image canvas, which combines an intuitive natural language interface with precise spatial control over the generated content. We propose ZestGuide, a zero-shot segmentation guidance approach that can be plugged into pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, and does not require any additional training. It leverages implicit segmentation maps that can be extracted from cross-attention layers, and uses them to align the generation with input masks. Our experimental results combine high image quality with accurate alignment of generated content with input segmentations, and improve over prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively, including methods that require training on images with corresponding segmentations. Compared to Paint with Words, the previous state-of-the art in image generation with zero-shot segmentation conditioning, we improve by 5 to 10 mIoU points on the COCO dataset with similar FID scores.

- **Summary**: Information extraction (IE), one of the main tasks of natural language processing (NLP), has recently increased importance in the use of resumes. In studies on the text to extract information from the CV, sentence classification was generally made using NLP models. In this study, it is aimed to extract information by classifying all of the text groups after pre-processing such as Optical Character Recognition (OCT) and object recognition with the YOLOv8 model of the resumes. The text dataset consists of 286 resumes collected for 5 different (education, experience, talent, personal and language) job descriptions in the IT industry. The dataset created for object recognition consists of 1198 resumes, which were collected from the open-source internet and labeled as sets of text. BERT, BERT-t, DistilBERT, RoBERTa and XLNet were used as models. F1 score variances were used to compare the model results. In addition, the YOLOv8 model has also been reported comparatively in itself. As a result of the comparison, DistilBERT was showed better results despite having a lower number of parameters than other models.

- **Summary**: Transformer models have shown great potential in computer vision, following their success in language tasks. Swin Transformer is one of them that outperforms convolution-based architectures in terms of accuracy, while improving efficiency when compared to Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants, which have quadratic complexity with respect to the input size. Swin Transformer features shifting windows that allows cross-window connection while limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows. However, shifting windows introduces memory copy operations, which account for a significant portion of its runtime. To mitigate this issue, we propose Swin-Free in which we apply size-varying windows across stages, instead of shifting windows, to achieve cross-connection among local windows. With this simple design change, Swin-Free runs faster than the Swin Transformer at inference with better accuracy. Furthermore, we also propose a few of Swin-Free variants that are faster than their Swin Transformer counterparts.

- **Summary**: Video analysis is a computer vision task that is useful for many applications like surveillance, human-machine interaction, and autonomous vehicles. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are currently the state-of-the-art methods for video analysis. However they have high computational costs, and need a large amount of labeled data for training. In this paper, we use Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks (CSNNs) trained with the unsupervised Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rule for action classification. These networks represent the information using asynchronous low-energy spikes. This allows the network to be more energy efficient and neuromorphic hardware-friendly. However, the behaviour of CSNNs is not studied enough with spatio-temporal computer vision models. Therefore, we explore transposing two-stream neural networks into the spiking domain. Implementing this model with unsupervised STDP-based CSNNs allows us to further study the performance of these networks with video analysis. In this work, we show that two-stream CSNNs can successfully extract spatio-temporal information from videos despite using limited training data, and that the spiking spatial and temporal streams are complementary. We also show that using a spatio-temporal stream within a spiking STDP-based two-stream architecture leads to information redundancy and does not improve the performance.

- **Summary**: Chest radiographs are the most commonly performed radiological examinations for lesion detection. Recent advances in deep learning have led to encouraging results in various thoracic disease detection tasks. Particularly, the architecture with feature pyramid network performs the ability to recognise targets with different sizes. However, such networks are difficult to focus on lesion regions in chest X-rays due to their high resemblance in vision. In this paper, we propose a dual attention supervised module for multi-label lesion detection in chest radiographs, named DualAttNet. It efficiently fuses global and local lesion classification information based on an image-level attention block and a fine-grained disease attention algorithm. A binary cross entropy loss function is used to calculate the difference between the attention map and ground truth at image level. The generated gradient flow is leveraged to refine pyramid representations and highlight lesion-related features. We evaluate the proposed model on VinDr-CXR, ChestX-ray8 and COVID-19 datasets. The experimental results show that DualAttNet surpasses baselines by 0.6% to 2.7% mAP and 1.4% to 4.7% AP50 with different detection architectures.

- **Summary**: Diligently gathered human demonstrations serve as the unsung heroes empowering the progression of robot learning. Today, demonstrations are collected by training people to use specialized controllers, which (tele-)operate robots to manipulate a small number of objects. By contrast, we introduce AR2-D2: a system for collecting demonstrations which (1) does not require people with specialized training, (2) does not require any real robots during data collection, and therefore, (3) enables manipulation of diverse objects with a real robot. AR2-D2 is a framework in the form of an iOS app that people can use to record a video of themselves manipulating any object while simultaneously capturing essential data modalities for training a real robot. We show that data collected via our system enables the training of behavior cloning agents in manipulating real objects. Our experiments further show that training with our AR data is as effective as training with real-world robot demonstrations. Moreover, our user study indicates that users find AR2-D2 intuitive to use and require no training in contrast to four other frequently employed methods for collecting robot demonstrations.
